question: Is anorectal endosonography valuable in dyschesia? context: Dyschesia can be provoked by inappropriate defecation movements. The aim of this prospective study was to demonstrate dysfunction of the anal sphincter and/or the musculus (m.) puborectalis in patients with dyschesia using anorectal endosonography. Twenty consecutive patients with a medical history of dyschesia and a control group of 20 healthy subjects underwent linear anorectal endosonography (Toshiba models IUV 5060 and PVL-625 RT). In both groups, the dimensions of the anal sphincter and the m. puborectalis were measured at rest, and during voluntary squeezing and straining. Statistical analysis was performed within and between the two groups. The anal sphincter became paradoxically shorter and/or thicker during straining (versus the resting state) in 85% of patients but in only 35% of control subjects. Changes in sphincter length were statistically significantly different (p<0.01, chi(2) test) in patients compared with control subjects. The m. puborectalis became paradoxically shorter and/or thicker during straining in 80% of patients but in only 30% of controls. Both the changes in length and thickness of the m. puborectalis were significantly different (p<0.01, chi(2) test) in patients versus control subjects. answer: Linear anorectal endosonography demonstrated incomplete or even absent relaxation of the anal sphincter and the m. puborectalis during a defecation movement in the majority of our patients with dyschesia. This study highlights the value of this elegant ultrasonographic technique in the diagnosis of "pelvic floor dyssynergia" or "anismus".	yes
question: Is there a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension? context: Sublingual varices have earlier been related to ageing, smoking and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sublingual varices are related to presence of hypertension. In an observational clinical study among 431 dental patients tongue status and blood pressure were documented. Digital photographs of the lateral borders of the tongue for grading of sublingual varices were taken, and blood pressure was measured. Those patients without previous diagnosis of hypertension and with a noted blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or ≥ 90 mmHg at the dental clinic performed complementary home blood pressure during one week. Those with an average home blood pressure ≥ 135 mmHg and/or ≥ 85 mmHg were referred to the primary health care centre, where three office blood pressure measurements were taken with one week intervals. Two independent blinded observers studied the photographs of the tongues. Each photograph was graded as none/few (grade 0) or medium/severe (grade 1) presence of sublingual varices. Pearson's Chi-square test, Student's t-test, and multiple regression analysis were applied. Power calculation stipulated a study population of 323 patients. An association between sublingual varices and hypertension was found (OR = 2.25, p<0.002). Mean systolic blood pressure was 123 and 132 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.0001, CI 95 %). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 80 and 83 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.005, CI 95 %). Sublingual varices indicate hypertension with a positive predictive value of 0.5 and a negative predictive value of 0.80. answer: An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.	yes
question: Is the affinity column-mediated immunoassay method suitable as an alternative to the microparticle enzyme immunoassay method as a blood tacrolimus assay? context: Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressive drug used in organ transplantation. Because of its substantial toxic effects, narrow therapeutic index, and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability, therapeutic drug monitoring of whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations has been recommended. We investigated the comparability of the results of 2 immunoassay systems, affinity column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA), comparing differences in the tacrolimus concentrations measured by the 2 methods in relation to the hematologic and biochemical values of hepatic and renal functions. A total of 154 samples from kidney or liver transplant recipients were subjected to Dimension RxL HM with a tacrolimus Flex reagent cartilage for the ACMIA method and IMx tacrolimus II for the MEIA method. Tacrolimus concentrations measured by the ACMIA method (n = 154) closely correlated with those measured by the MEIA method (r = 0.84). The Bland-Altman plot using concentration differences between the 2 methods and the average of the 2 methods showed no specific trends. The tacrolimus levels determined by both the MEIA method and the ACMIA method were not influenced by hematocrit levels, but the difference between the 2 methods (ACMIA - MEIA) tended to be larger in low hematocrit samples (P<.001). answer: The ACMIA method used for a tacrolimus assay is precise and has advantages, including the lack of a required pretreatment procedure. Furthermore, it is only slightly influenced by the hematologic or biochemical status of the samples.	yes
question: Does a physician's specialty influence the recording of medication history in patients' case notes? context: To determine the impact of a physician's specialty on the frequency and depth of medication history documented in patient medical records. A cross-sectional assessment of the frequency and depth of medication history information documented by 123 physicians for 900 randomly selected patients stratified across Cardiology, Chest, Dermatology, Endocrine, Gastroenterology, Haematology, Neurology, Psychiatry and Renal specialties was carried out at a 900-bed teaching hospital located in Ibadan, Nigeria. Four hundred and forty-three (49.2%) of the cohort were males and 457 (50.8%) were females; with mean ages 43.2 +/- 18.6 and 43.1 +/- 17.9 years respectively. Physicians' specialties significantly influenced the depth of documentation of the medication history information across the nine specialties (P<0.0001). Post hoc pair-wise comparisons with Tukey's HSD test showed that the mean scores for adverse drug reactions and adherence to medicines was highest in the Cardiology specialty; while the Chest specialty had the highest mean scores for allergy to drugs, food, chemicals and cigarette smoking. Mean scores for the use of alcohol; illicit drugs; dietary restrictions was highest for Gastroenterology, Psychiatry and Endocrine specialties respectively. Physicians' specialties also significantly influenced the frequency of documentation of the medication history across the nine specialties (P<0.0001). answer: Physicians appear to document more frequently and in greater depth medication history information that may aid the diagnostic tasks in their specific specialty. Researchers and other users of medication history data documented in patients' medical records by physicians may want to take special cognizance of this phenomenon.	yes
question: Locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy: a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy? context: Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy (LITT) of rat brains is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability changes. We address the question of whether LITT-induced locoregional disruption of the BBB could possibly allow a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into brain tissue to treat malignant glioma.STUDY DESIGN/ CD Fischer rats were subject to LITT of the left forebrain. Disruption of the BBB was analyzed using Evans blue and immunohistochemistry (IH). Animals were perfused with paclitaxel, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to analyze the content of paclitaxel in brain and plasma samples. LITT induces an opening of the BBB as demonstrated by locoregional extravasation of Evans blue, C3C, fibrinogen, and IgM. HPLC proved the passage of paclitaxel across the disrupted BBB. answer: LITT induces a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into the brain tissue. This is of potential interest for the treatment of brain tumors.	yes
question: Spinal subdural hematoma: a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm? context: A case of spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) because of a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm is described. Such a case has never been reported. A 52-year-old woman underwent a craniotomy for a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm. A computed tomography scan showed that SAH existed predominantly in the posterior fossa and subdural hematoma beneath the cerebellar tentorium. Intrathecal administration of urokinase, IV administration of fasudil hydrochloride, and continuous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evacuation via cisternal drainage were performed as prophylactic treatments for vasospasm. On the sixth postoperative day, the patient complained of severe lower back and buttock pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a subdural hematoma in the lumbosacral region. Although the mass effect was extensive, the patient showed no neurologic symptoms other than the sciatica. She was treated conservatively. The hematoma dissolved gradually and had diminished completely 15 weeks later. Her pain gradually subsided, and she was discharged 7 weeks later without any neurologic deficit. answer: Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.	yes
question: Is there a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women? context: For women, the correlation between circulating androgens and sexual desire is inconclusive. Substitution with androgens at physiological levels improves sexual function in women who experience decreased sexual desire and androgen deficiency from surgical menopause, pituitary disease, and age-related decline in androgen production in the ovaries. Measuring bioactive testosterone is difficult and new methods have been proposed, including measuring the primary androgen metabolite androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G).AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between serum levels of androgens and sexual desire in women and whether the level of ADT-G is better correlated than the level of circulating androgens with sexual desire. This was a cross-sectional study including 560 healthy women aged 19-65 years divided into three age groups. Correlations were considered to be statistically significant at P<0.05. Sexual desire was determined as the total score of the sexual desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index. Total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and ADT-G were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Sexual desire correlated overall with FT and androstenedione in the total cohort of women. In a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years with no use of systemic hormonal contraception, sexual desire correlated with TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS. In women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. No correlations between ADT-G and sexual desire were identified. answer: In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.	yes
question: Is the zeolite hemostatic agent beneficial in reducing blood loss during arterial injury? context: Uncontrolled hemorrhage is the leading cause of fatality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zeolite mineral (QuikClot - Advanced Clotting Sponge [QC-ACS]) on blood loss and physiological variables in a swine extremity arterial injury model. Sixteen swine were used. Oblique groin incision was created and a 5 mm incision was made. The animals were allocated to: control group (n: 6): Pressure dressing was applied with manual pressure over gauze sponge; or QC group (n: 10): QC was directly applied over lacerated femoral artery. Mean arterial pressure, blood loss and physiological parameters were measured during the study period. Application of QC led to a slower drop in blood pressure. The control group had a significantly higher increase in lactate within 60 minutes. The mean prothrombin time in the control group was significantly increased at 60 minutes. The application of QC led to decreased total blood loss. The QC group had significantly higher hematocrit levels. QC application generated a significant heat production. There were mild edematous and vacuolar changes in nerve samples. answer: According to the physiological parameters, we observed that zeolite tends to reduce blood loss, however could not stop bleeding completely. We believe that further clinical trials are needed to conclude that zeolite could be used in the routine practice.	yes
question: Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade? context: The most common primary brain tumors in children and adults are of astrocytic origin. Classic histologic grading schemes for astrocytomas have included evaluating the presence or absence of nuclear abnormalities, mitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation, and tumor necrosis. We evaluated the vascular pattern of 17 astrocytoma surgical specimens (seven from children and 10 from adults), and four normal brains obtained at autopsy, utilizing antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) utilizing confocal microscopy. A modified WHO classification was used. All tumor cases showed cells positive for GFAP. Control tissues showed a few, widely separated vessels. Pilocytic astrocytomas (four cases) showed lacy clusters of small-to-medium sized vessels, with intact vessel wall integrity. Diffuse, low grade astrocytoma (three cases) showed a staining pattern similar to control tissue; intermediate grade (one case), anaplastic astrocytoma (three cases) and gliobastoma multiforme (six cases) showed an increased vessel density with multiple small vessels (glomeruloid clusters), some with prominent intimal hyperplasia, loss of vessel wall integrity, and with numerous vWF-positive single cells/microvessels within the tumor substance. answer: Evaluation of astrocytomas utilizing antibody to vWF and confocal microscopy aids in the grading of these neoplasms.	yes
question: Should cavitation in proximal surfaces be reported in cone beam computed tomography examination? context: 79 adjacent proximal surfaces without restorations in permanent teeth were examined. Patients suspected to have carious lesions after a visual clinical and a bitewing examination participated in a CBCT examination (Kodak 9000 3D, 5 × 3.7 cm field of view, voxel size 0.07 mm). Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained according to the Helsinki Declaration. Radiographic assessment recording lesions with or without cavitation was performed by two observers in bitewings and CBCT sections. Orthodontic separators were placed interdentally between two lesion-suspected surfaces. The separator was removed after 3 days and the surfaces recorded as cavitated (yes/no), i.e. validated clinically. Differences between the two radiographic modalities (sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy) were estimated by analyzing the binary data in a generalized linear model. For both observers, sensitivity was significantly higher for CBCT than for bitewings (average difference 33%, p<0.001) while specificity was not significantly different between the methods (p = 0.19). The overall accuracy was also significantly higher for CBCT (p<0.001). answer: CBCT was more accurate in detecting cavitation in proximal surfaces than bitewing radiographs; therefore a CBCT examination performed for other clinical applications should also be assessed for proximal surface cavities in teeth without restorations, and when detected, this pathology must be part of the dentist's report.	yes
question: Ultrasound in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis; a useful addition to clinical staging? context: As part of the staging procedure in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, we assessed the role of ultrasound examination, in particular its role in assessing the extent and the invasion into the corpora. From 1988 until 1992, all patients referred for primary treatment underwent ultrasound assessment with a 7.5 MHz linear array small parts transducer as part of the clinical workup. All ultrasound images were reviewed by one radiologist, without knowledge of the clinical outcome and were compared with the results obtained at histopathologic examination. In 16 patients the primary tumor and in 1 patient a recurrent cancer after primary therapy were examined. All tumors were identified as hypoechoic lesions. Ultrasound examination in the region of the glans was not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the corpus spongiosum, but absence or presence of invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum was clearly demonstrated. Accurate measurement by ultrasound of maximum tumor thickness was seen in seven of sixteen examinations. answer: While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.	yes
question: Can third trimester ultrasound predict the presentation of the first twin at delivery? context: To determine the ability of early sonogram to predict the presentation of twin A at birth. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all twin pregnancies evaluated at our Fetal Evaluation Unit from 2007 to 2009. Sonogram records were reviewed for the presentation of twin A at seven gestational age intervals and inpatient medical records were reviewed for the presentation of twin A at delivery. The positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of presentation as determined by ultrasound, at each gestational age interval, for the same presentation at delivery were calculated. Two hundred and thirty-eight twin pregnancies met inclusion criteria. A total of 896 ultrasounds were reviewed. The positive predictive value of cephalic presentation of twin A as determined by ultrasound for the persistence of cephalic presentation at delivery reached 95% after 28 weeks gestation. The positive predictive value for noncephalic presentation as established by sonogram for noncephalic at delivery was>90% after 32 weeks gestation. answer: The presentation of the first twin at delivery can be determined by sonogram by the 32nd week of gestation in over 90% of twin pregnancies.	yes
question: Is micro-computed tomography reliable to determine the microstructure of the maxillary alveolar bone? context: To analyze the reliability of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to assess bone density and the microstructure of the maxillary bones at the alveolar process in human clinics by direct comparison with conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry. Analysis of osseous microstructural variables including bone volumetric density (BV/TV) of 39 biopsies from the maxillary alveolar bone was performed by micro-CT. Conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry of 10 bone biopsies was performed by optic microscopy (OM) and low-vacuum surface electronic microscopy (SEM). Percentages of bone between micro-CT and conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry were compared. Significant positive correlations were observed between BV/TV and the percentage of bone (%Bone) analyzed by SEM (r = 0.933, P < 0.001), by toluidine blue staining OM (r = 0.950, P < 0.001) and by dark field OM (r = 0.667, P = 0.05). The high positive correlation coefficient between BV/TV and trabecular thickness illustrates that a value of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules thicker than 0.2 mm. The high negative correlation between BV/TV and trabecular separation shows that values of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules separated less than 0.3 mm each other. answer: BV/TV assessed by micro-CT correlates with the percentage of bone assessed by conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry. Micro-CT is a reliable technique to determine the bone density and the microstructure of the maxillary alveolar bone at the site of dental implant insertion.	yes
question: Is primary angioplasty an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis? context: The National Infarct Angioplasty Project assessed the feasibility of establishing a comprehensive primary angioplasty service. We aimed to compare satisfaction at intervention hospitals offering angioplasty-based care and control hospitals offering thrombolysis-based care. Mixed methods, with postal survey of patients and their carers, supported by semi-structured interviews. Survey of 682 patients and 486 carers, and interviews with 33 patients and carers, in eight English hospitals. Primary angioplasty or thrombolysis. Satisfaction with treatment. Responses were received from 595/682 patients (87%) and 418/486 carers (86%). Satisfaction with overall care was high at both intervention and control sites (78% vs. 71% patients rated their care as 'excellent', P = 0.074). Patient satisfaction was higher at intervention sites for some aspects of care such as speed of treatment (80% vs. 67%'excellent', P = 0.001). Convenience of visiting was rated lower at intervention sites by carers (12% vs. 1%'poor', P = 0.001). During interviews, carers reported that they accepted the added inconvenience of visiting primary angioplasty sites in the context of this life-saving treatment. Patient satisfaction with discharge and aftercare was lower in both treatment groups than for other aspects of care. answer: Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.	yes
question: Is endometrial polyp formation associated with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta1? context: Endometrial polyp is a common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding, but the etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is angiogenic, related to thick walled vessels and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) is related to fibrotic tissue, which are characteristics of endometrial polyps. The primary objective of this study was to find out if endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of VEGF or TGF-β1, or both. A secondary objective is to determine if the changes are related to steroid receptor expression. This prospective study compared VEGF and TGF-β1 expression of endometrial polyps and adjacent endometrial tissue in 70 premenopausal women. The comparison of results was separately made for endometrium specimens obtained in the proliferative and secretory phases. The results were correlated with the steroid receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) expression. The score of VEGF in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P<0.001) and the secretory phase (P=0.03); the score of VEGF in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium only in proliferative phase (P=0.006). The score of TGF-β1 in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium in proliferative phase (P=0.02); whereas the score of TGF-β1 in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P=0.006) and the secretory phase (P=0.008). There was a significant correlation between the expression of steroid receptors and VEGF and TGF-β1 (Spearman's correlation P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). answer: There was increased expression of TGF-β1 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-β1 expression.	yes
question: Improvements in survival of gynaecological cancer in the Anglia region of England: are these an effect of centralisation of care and use of multidisciplinary management? context: Our hypothesis is that the adoption of Department of Health (DH) guidance has led to an improvement in outcome in gynaecological cancer survival. In 1999 the DH in England introduced the Improving Outcomes in Gynaecological Cancer guidance, advising case management by multidisciplinary teams with surgical concentration in specialist hospitals. This guidance was rapidly adopted in the East of England, with a population of 2.5 million. The population of the Anglia Cancer Network was approximately 2.3 million. From 1996 to 2003, details of 3406 cases of gynaecological cancer were identified in the Anglia region of England. Survival analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazards regression, relative to cases diagnosed in 1996. Primary endpoint was survival. The survival rates for cases diagnosed between 1996 and 1999 were broadly the same across the time period, with a marked improvement taking place in 2000, and continuing to 2003 (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.79, comparing 2000-03 with 1996-99 diagnoses), for all gynaecological sites combined. Adjustment for treatments or method of case follow-up did not attenuate these improvements. There was a concurrent change towards major surgery being performed in specialist centres from 2000. answer: The adoption of the 1999 guidance on gynaecological cancer, which included multidisciplinary case management and centralisation of surgery, resulted in a marked step-change improvement in survival of gynaecological cancer in an area of eastern England in 2000.	yes
question: Estimated fetal weight by ultrasound: a modifiable risk factor for cesarean delivery? context: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether knowledge of ultrasound-obtained estimated fetal weight (US-EFW) is a risk factor for cesarean delivery (CD). Retrospective cohort from a single center in 2009-2010 of singleton, term live births. CD rates were compared for women with and without US-EFW within 1 month of delivery and adjusted for potential confounders. Of the 2329 women in our cohort, 50.2% had US-EFW within 1 month of delivery. CD was significantly more common for women with US-EFW (15.7% vs 10.2%; P<.001); after we controlled for confounders, US-EFW remained an independent risk factor for CD (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.9). The risk increased when US-EFW was>3500 g (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.7). answer: Knowledge of US-EFW, above and beyond the impact of fetal size itself, increases the risk of CD. Acquisition of US-EFW near term appears to be an independent and potentially modifiable risk factor for CD.	yes
question: Are financial incentives cost-effective to support smoking cessation during pregnancy? context: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of up to £400 worth of financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy as an adjunct to routine health care. Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a cost-utility analysis using a life-time Markov model. The RCT was undertaken in Glasgow, Scotland. The economic analysis was undertaken from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. A total of 612 pregnant women randomized to receive usual cessation support plus or minus financial incentives of up to £400 vouchers (US $609), contingent upon smoking cessation. Comparison of usual support and incentive interventions in terms of cotinine-validated quitters, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct costs to the NHS. The incremental cost per quitter at 34-38 weeks pregnant was £1127 ($1716).This is similar to the standard look-up value derived from Stapleton&West's published ICER tables, £1390 per quitter, by looking up the Cessation in Pregnancy Incentives Trial (CIPT) incremental cost (£157) and incremental 6-month quit outcome (0.14). The life-time model resulted in an incremental cost of £17 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -£93, £107] and a gain of 0.04 QALYs (95% CI = -0.058, 0.145), giving an ICER of £482/QALY ($734/QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates uncertainty in these results, particularly regarding relapse after birth. The expected value of perfect information was £30 million (at a willingness to pay of £30 000/QALY), so given current uncertainty, additional research is potentially worthwhile. answer: Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of £482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.	yes
question: Do adjuvant aromatase inhibitors increase the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer? context: Despite the advantages from using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) compared with tamoxifen for early breast cancer, an unexpectedly greater number of grade 3 and 4 cardiovascular events (CVAE) (as defined by National Cancer Institute of Canada-Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0] was demonstrated. Phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing AI with tamoxifen in early breast cancer were considered eligible for this review. The event-based risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were derived, and a test of heterogeneity was applied. Finally, absolute differences (ADs) in event rates and the number of patients needed to harm 1 patient (NNH) were determined. Seven eligible RCTs (19,818 patients) reported CVAE results. When considering all RCTs, the AD of the primary endpoint (CVAE) between the 2 arms (0.52%), tamoxifen versus AI, was statistically significant (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.60; P= .007). This translated into an NNH value of 189 patients; when only third-generation AIs were considered, the difference (0.57%) remained significant (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09-1.63; P= .0038). Thromboembolic events were significantly more frequent in the tamoxifen arm, regardless of the strategy adopted (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42-0.65; P<.0001), without significant heterogeneity (P= .21). An AD of 1.17% and an NNH value of 85 patients were observed. answer: According to the results from this meta-analysis, the risk of grade 3 and 4 CVAEs in patients who were receiving AIs was higher compared with the risk in patients who were receiving tamoxifen, and the difference reached statistical significance. However, the AD was relatively low, and from 160 to 180 patients had to be treated to produce 1 event.	yes
question: Is fear of anaphylactic shock discouraging surgeons from more widely adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cyst? context: Sources of reports about laparoscopic and percutaneous treatment of liver hydatid cysts are limited to just a few countries. To address the reason behind this, we carried out a survey of 30 surgeons in northern Jordan. A questionnaire was distributed to collect data regarding the surgical technique preferred by each surgeon. Further information was collected from those not adopting minimal-access techniques to determine their reasons for not doing so. Only 3 surgeons (10%) considered laparoscopy as the first line of treatment. Of the 27 surgeons who did not consider percutaneous or laparoscopic treatment, fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination was the main reason given by 21 surgeons (78%) for not using minimal access techniques. answer: The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.	yes
question: Risk stratification in emergency surgical patients: is the APACHE II score a reliable marker of physiological impairment? context: The APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score used as an intensive care unit (ICU) admission score in emergency surgical patients is not independent of the effects of treatment and might lead to considerable bias in the comparability of defined groups of patients and in the evaluation of treatment policies. Postoperative monitoring with the APACHE II score is clinically irrelevant. Inception cohort study. Secondary referral center. Eighty-five consecutive emergency surgical patients admitted to the surgical ICU in 1999. The APACHE II score was calculated before surgery; after admission to the ICU; and on postoperative days 3, 7, and 10. APACHE II scores and predicted and observed mortality rates. The mean +/- SD APACHE II score of 24.2 +/- 8.3 at admission to the ICU was approximately 36% greater than the initial APACHE II score of 17.8 +/- 7.7, a difference that was highly statistically significant (P<.001). The overall mortality of 32% favorably corresponds with the predicted mortality of 34% according to the initial APACHE II score. However, the predicted mortality of 50% according to the APACHE II score at admission to the ICU was significantly different from the observed mortality rate (P =.02). In 40 long-term patients (>/=10 days in the ICU), the difference between the APACHE II scores of survivors and patients who died was statistically significant on day 10 (P =.04). answer: For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.	yes
question: Can Flexible Instruments Create Adequate Femoral Tunnel Lengths at 90° of Knee Flexion in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction? context: This study aims to study femoral tunnel lengths drilled with a flexible reamer and the distance to important lateral structures obtained by flexing the knee at various angles and by drilling the guide pins arthroscopically to resemble clinical practice. The purpose of this cadaveric study was twofold: 1. to determine whether femoral tunnel lengths of greater than 20 mm can be created with a flexible reamer system at 90 ° of knee flexion and 2. to determine whether the lateral structures of the knee are safe with this technique. Ten fresh cadaveric knees were utilized. The intra-osseous length can be measured with a specially de - signed flexible guide pin. Flexible pins were inserted with the knee at 70°, 90°, and 120° of flexion. The intra-osseous length was measured with the measuring device. Each speci - men was dissected around the lateral aspect of the knee to identify the critical structures, the common peroneal nerve, and the LCL. The distance from the guide pins to the com - mon peroneal nerve and femoral attachment of the LCL were measured with a standard flexible paper ruler to the nearest millimeter. There is a trend for progressively increasing mean intra-osseous length associated with increased flexion of the knee. The mean intra-osseous length for 70° flexion was 25.2 mm (20 mm to 32 mm), which was statistically significant when compared to mean intra-osseous lengths of 32.1 mm (22 mm to 45 mm) and 38.0 mm (34 mm to 45 mm) in the 90° and 120° flexion groups, respectively (p<0.05). There were no significant differences among the groups with respect to distance to the LCL. There is a trend toward longer distances to the common peroneal nerve with increased flexion. There was a statistically significant dif - ference when comparing 120° versus 70° (p<0.05). answer: This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.	yes
question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death? context: Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells. answer: Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.	yes
question: "Occult" posttraumatic lesions of the knee: can magnetic resonance substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy? context: We investigated the actual role of MRI versus arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in patients with previous musculoskeletal trauma of the knee, pain and severe functional impairment. Occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee are trauma-related bone and/or cartilage damage missed at plain radiography. We retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression. We identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%. In 6 stress injuries, the injury site was localized in the medial tibial condyle in 80% of cases, while meniscal and ligament tears were absent. answer: After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.	yes
question: Does Sensation Return to the Nasal Tip After Microfat Grafting? context: Patients usually complain about numbness in the nasal tip after microfat injections. The present study evaluated the severity of the numbness in the nasal tip after the procedure. To address the research question, a prospective study of young women was designed and performed at the Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Time was the primary predictor variable. The nasal tip sensation, which was evaluated using objective and subjective assessments, was used as the primary outcome variable. The McNemar-Bowker test (time vs nasal tip sensation) was used to detect statistical significance. A total of 30 young women (age 20.04 ± 3.63 years) were recruited for the present study. The preoperative mean touch threshold value was 3.60 units. One week after the injection, the women experienced a decrease in the touch threshold value by 2.50 units. However, the sensation recovered gradually during the follow-up period (1.51 units at week 2, 2.39 units at week 4, 3.01 units at week 8, and 3.35 units at week 12). Significant differences were detected between multiple different measurement points (P<.05). The percentage of those experiencing paresthesia after the microfat injections also gradually diminished to none. answer: Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.	yes
question: Do some U.S. states have higher/lower injury mortality rates than others? context: This article examines the hypothesis that the six U.S. states with the highest rates of road traffic deaths (group 1 states) also had above-average rates of other forms of injury such as falling, poisoning, drowning, fire, suffocation, homicide, and suicide, and also for the retail trade and construction industries. The converse, second hypothesis, for the six states with the lowest rates of road traffic deaths (group 2 states) is also examined. Data for these 12 states for the period 1983 to 1995 included nine categories of unintentional and four categories of intentional injury. Seventy-four percent of the group 1 states conformed to the first hypothesis, and 85% of the group 2 states conformed to the second hypothesis. answer: Group 1 states are likely to exhibit above-average rates for most other categories of injury death, whereas group 2 states are even more likely to exhibit below-average rates for most other categories of injury death.	yes
question: Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors? context: Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is the functional renal failure associated with advanced cirrhosis and has also been described in fulminant hepatic failure. Without liver transplantation its prognosis is dismal. Our study included patients with type 1 HRS associated with cirrhosis, who were not liver transplant candidates.AIM: To identify variables associated with improved survival. Sixty-eight patients fulfilled the revised Ascites Club Criteria for type 1 HRS. None of them was suitable for liver transplantation. All the patients were treated with combinations of: albumin, midodrine and octreotide, pressors, and hemodialysis. Median survival was 13 days for the whole group. Survival varied with the end-stage liver disease (ESLD) etiology: autoimmune, 49 days, cardiac cirrhosis, 22 days, idiopathic, 15.5 days, viral, 15 days, hepatitis C and alcohol, 14.5 days, alcohol 8 days, and neoplasia 4 days (p = 0.048). Survival of HRS associated with alcoholic liver disease versus other etiologies was not statistically significant (p = 0.1). Increased serum creatinine (p = 0.02) and urinary sodium 6-10 mEq/l (p = 0.027) at the initiation of therapy were prognostic factors for mortality. HRS treatment modalities (p = 0.73), use of dialysis (p = 0.56), dialysis modality (p = 0.35), use of vasopressors (p = 0.26), pre-existing renal disease (p = 0.49), gender (p = 0.90), and age (p = 0.57) were not associated with survival. answer: We report for the first time ESLD etiology as a prognostic factor for survival. The renal function (expressed as serum creatinine) and urinary Na (<5 mEq/l) at the time of diagnosis were found to be associated with survival, suggesting that early treatment might increase survival.	yes
question: The Main Gate Syndrome: a new format in mass-casualty victim "surge" management? context: Recent suicide bombings pose the novel problem for Trauma Centers of the massive simultaneous arrival of many gravely wounded patients. We report the experience of the French-German Military Trauma Group, a Level 2 Trauma Center, in Afghanistan during the wave of suicide bombings in February 2007. Fourteen casualties were received. A first triage was carried out by the U S Army Level I group prior to evacuation. A second surgical triage was carried out with systematic ultrasound exam. Four cases (ISS>25) were re-categorized and underwent emergency surgical procedures. answer: Suicide bombing in crowded locations near an evacuation hospital may overwhelm the medical resources of the receiving center. It has been referred to as "The Main Gate Syndrome." We introduced the novel concept of a semi-evacuation hospital or receiving center where a second surgical triage was carried out. These exceptional circumstances require open-minded flexibility, a tailored approach, and close cooperation between surgeons and anesthetists to share experience, opinions, and ideas. In the setting of mass casualties, emergency ultrasound exam was shown to be a valuable and effective tool by virtue of its mobility, reproducibility, and immediate results.	yes
question: Is EQ-5D a valid quality of life instrument in patients with acute coronary syndrome? context: To evaluate the construct validity of the Turkish version of the EQ-5D in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study at the Trakya University Hospital between February and May 2008. All patients completed the Turkish version of the EQ-5D and MacNew heart-related quality of life scale. Construct validity of the EQ-5D was assessed according to relationships with MacNew subscales by using Spearman rank correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. One hundred and twenty-two patients responded to the instruments. Mean age was 62.9±9.3 years and male gender (88 or 72.1%) was dominant. Mean score of the EQ-5D index was 0.79±0.32, while the global score of MacNew was 5.01±1.16. The correlation coefficients of the EQ-5D index score with the MacNew subscales ranged from 0.557 to 0.721, with EQ-5D VAS score ranging from 0.297 to 0.484 (p<0.001 for all of them). According to the stepwise regression model MacNew global score was found to be significantly effective factor on EQ-5D index score (β =0.188; 95% CI: 0.152-0.224; p<0.001). answer: The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.	yes
question: Is portable ultrasonography accurate in the evaluation of Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments? context: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of ultrasonography to confirm Schanz pin placement in a cadaveric model, and the interobserver repeatability of the ultrasound methodology. This investigation is a repeated measures cadaveric study with multiple examiners. Cadaveric preparation and observations were done by an orthopaedic traumatologist and resident, and two general surgery traumatologists. A total of 16 Schanz pins were equally placed in bilateral femora and tibiae. Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection. Schanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography (p<0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude of pin protrusion increases. Ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range. Interobserver repeatability analysis demonstrated that all examiners were not statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with the ultrasound methodology (p>0.8). answer: Despite the statistical imparity of pin protrusion measurement via ultrasound compared to that of gross dissection, a consideration of the clinical relevance of ultrasound measurement bias during an austere operating theatre leads to the conclusion that ultrasonography is an adequate methodology for Schanz pin protrusion measurement.	yes
question: Is grandmultiparity an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes? context: To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes among grandmultiparous women to those of multiparous women 30 years or older. A database of the vast majority of maternal and newborn hospital discharge records linked to birth/death certificates was queried to obtain information on all multiparous women with a singleton delivery in the state of California from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1998. Maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes of grandmultiparous women were compared to multiparous women who were 30 years or older at the time of their last birth. The study population included 25,512 grandmultiparous and 265,060 multiparous women 30 years or older as controls. Grandmultiparous women were predominantly Hispanic (56%). After controlling for potential confounding factors, grandmultiparous women were at significantly higher risk for abruptio placentae (odds ratio OR: 1.3; 95% confidence intervals CI: 1.2-1.5), preterm delivery (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.2-1.4), fetal macrosomia (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.4-1.6), neonatal death (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.8), postpartum hemorrhage (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.3) and blood transfusion (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.8). answer: Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.	yes
question: Does depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location? context: Studies have linked ethnic differences in depression rates with neighbourhood ethnic density although results have not been conclusive. We looked at this using a novel approach analysing whole population data covering just over one million GP patients in four London boroughs. Using a dataset of GP records for all patients registered in Lambeth, Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Newham in 2013 we investigated new diagnoses of depression and antidepressant use for: Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, black Caribbean and black African patients. Neighbourhood effects were assessed independently of GP practice using a cross-classified multilevel model. Black and minority ethnic groups are up to four times less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants compared to white British patients. We found an inverse relationship between neighbourhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some groups, where an increase of 10% own-ethnic density was associated with a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduced odds of depression for Pakistani [odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.93], Indian (OR 0.88, CI 0.81-0.95), African (OR 0.88, CI 0.78-0.99) and Bangladeshi (OR 0.94, CI 0.90-0.99) patients. Black Caribbean patients, however, showed the opposite effect (OR 1.26, CI 1.09-1.46). The results for antidepressant use were very similar although the corresponding effect for black Caribbeans was no longer statistically significant (p = 0.07). answer: New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.	yes
question: Learning needs of postpartum women: does socioeconomic status matter? context: Little is known about how information needs change over time in the early postpartum period or about how these needs might differ given socioeconomic circumstances. This study's aim was to examine women's concerns at the time of hospital discharge and unmet learning needs as self-identified at 4 weeks after discharge. Data were collected as part of a cross-sectional survey of postpartum health outcomes, service use, and costs of care in the first 4 weeks after postpartum hospital discharge. Recruitment of 250 women was conducted from each of 5 hospitals in Ontario, Canada (n = 1,250). Women who had given vaginal birth to a single live infant, and who were being discharged at the same time as their infant, assuming care of their infant, competent to give consent, and able to communicate in one of the study languages were eligible. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire in hospital; 890 (71.2%) took part in a structured telephone interview 4 weeks after hospital discharge. Approximately 17 percent of participants were of low socioeconomic status. Breastfeeding and signs of infant illness were the most frequently identified concerns by women, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Signs of infant illness and infant care/behavior were the main unmet learning needs. Although few differences in identified concerns were evident, women of low socioeconomic status were significantly more likely to report unmet learning needs related to 9 of 10 topics compared with women of higher socioeconomic status. For most topics, significantly more women of both groups identified learning needs 4 weeks after discharge compared with the number who identified corresponding concerns while in hospital. answer: It is important to ensure that new mothers are adequately informed about topics important to them while in hospital. The findings highlight the need for accessible and appropriate community-based information resources for women in the postpartum period, especially for those of low socioeconomic status.	yes
question: Is there a differential in the dental health of new recruits to the British Armed Forces? context: Figures from the British Defence Dental Services reveal that serving personnel in the British Army have a persistently lower level of dental fitness than those in the Royal Navy or the Royal Air Force. No research had been undertaken to ascertain if this reflects the oral health of recruits joining each Service. This study aimed to pilot a process for collecting dental and sociodemographic data from new recruits to each Service and examine the null hypothesis that no differences in dental health existed. Diagnostic criteria were developed, a sample size calculated and data collected at the initial training establishments of each Service. Data for 432 participants were entered into the analysis. Recruits in the Army sample had a significantly greater prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource need than either of the other two Services. Army recruits had a mean number of 2.59 (2.08, 3.09) decayed teeth per recruit, compared to 1.93 (1.49, 2.39 p<0.01) in Royal Navy recruits and 1.26 (0.98, 1.53 p<0.001) in Royal Air Force recruits. Among Army recruits 62.7% were from the two most deprived quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation compared to 42.5% of Royal Naval recruits and 36.6% of Royal Air Force recruits. answer: A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.	yes
question: Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term? context: It is postulated that some aspects of methotrexate toxicity may be related to its action as an anti-folate. Folic acid (FA) is often given as an adjunct to methotrexate therapy, but there is no conclusive proof that it decreases the toxicity of methotrexate and there is a theoretical risk that it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate. To look at the effect of stopping FA supplementation in UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily, to report all toxicity (including absolute changes in haematological and liver enzyme indices) and to report changes in the efficacy of methotrexate. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 75 patients who were established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily were asked to stop their FA and were randomized to one of two groups: placebo or FA 5 mg daily. Patients were evaluated for treatment toxicity and efficacy before entry and then at intervals of 3 months for 1 yr. Overall, 25 (33%) patients concluded the study early, eight (21%) in the group remaining on FA and 17 (46%) in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Two patients in the placebo group discontinued because of neutropenia. At 9 months there was an increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group (45 vs. 7%, P = 0.001). The placebo group had significantly lower disease activity on a few of the variables measured, but these were probably not of clinical significance. answer: It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.	yes
question: Can teaching medical students to investigate medication errors change their attitudes towards patient safety? context: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a patient-safety curriculum administered during a paediatric clerkship on medical students' attitudes towards patient safety. Medical students viewed an online video introducing them to systems-based analyses of medical errors. Faculty presented an example of a medication administration error and demonstrated use of the Learning From Defects tool to investigate the defect. Student groups identified and then analysed medication errors during their clinical rotation using the Learning From Defects framework to organise and present their findings. Outcomes included patient safety attitudinal changes, as measured by questions derived from the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. 108 students completed the curriculum between July 2008 and July 2009. All student groups (25 total) identified, analysed and presented patient safety concerns. Curriculum effectiveness was demonstrated by significant changes on questionnaire items related to patient safety attitudes. The majority of students felt that the curriculum was relevant to their clinical rotation and should remain part of the clerkship. answer: An active learning curriculum integrated into a clinical clerkship can change learners' attitudes towards patient safety. Students found the curriculum relevant and recommended its continuation.	yes
question: Does a delay in transfer to a rehabilitation unit for older people affect outcome after fracture of the proximal femur? context: To detemine the relationship between delay in transfer to rehabilitation wards and outcome for patients aged over 75 years with fracture of the proximal femur. An observational study in a district general hospital of all patients admitted to hospital aged over 75 years with fracture of the proximal femur over 3 1/2 years. Outcome data collected included the number of patients discharged back to their usual residence and total hospital length of stay related to age, gender, usual residence and delay in transfer to a rehabilitation ward. 58% of 455 patients were transferred to a rehabilitation ward. For those patients who were transferred to a rehabilitation ward only age predicted discharge to a more dependent residence. The relative risk for discharge to a more dependent residence for people aged over 85 years compared to younger people was 1.47 (95% CI 1.15-1.88). Delay in transfer to rehabilitation was associated with a longer total hospital length of stay of 0.64 (95% CI 0.23-1.05) days per day of delay in transfer. answer: Delay in transfer to a rehabilitation ward was associated with a disproportionate increase in total hospital length of stay for patients aged over 75 with fracture of the proximal femur.	yes
question: Are there gender differences in the reasons why African Americans delay in seeking medical help for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction? context: To identify gender differences in delay time and the reasons why African Americans delay in seeking medical care for symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Cross-sectional. Five hospitals in the San Francisco and East Bay areas. Sixty-one African American men and women diagnosed with an AMI. Prehospital delay time. Median delay time was longer for women compared to men (4.4 hours vs 3.5 hours), although the difference was not significant. Single women delayed longer than single men (P = .03), and women who were alone when symptoms began delayed longer than women with someone (P = .03). Women who received advice to seek help or call 911 upon symptom onset had shorter delays compared to women who were not advised to call 911 (P = .01). Men at home delayed longer than men who experienced their symptoms outside the home (P = .01). Men with emergency room insurance delayed longer than men without emergency room insurance (P = .03), and men who took an ambulance to the hospital had shorter delay times than men who took other means of transportation (P = .04). answer: Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.	yes
question: Does ambulatory process of care predict health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic disease? context: The validity of quality of care measurement has important implications for practicing clinicians, their patients, and all involved with health care delivery. We used empirical data from managed care patients enrolled in west coast physician organizations to test the hypothesis that observed changes in health-related quality of life across a 2.5-year window reflecting process of care.DATA SOURCES/ Patient self-report data as well as clinically detailed medical record review regarding 963 patients with chronic disease associated with managed care from three west coast states. Prospective cohort study of change in health-related quality of life scores across 30 months as measured by change in SF-12 physical component scores.DATA COLLECTION/ Patient self-report and medical record abstraction. We found a positive relationship between better process scores and higher burden of illness (p<.05). After adjustment for burden of illness, using an instrumental variables approach revealed better process is associated with smaller declines in SF-12 scores across a 30-month observation window (p=.014). The application of the best quartile of process of care to patients currently receiving poor process is associated with a 4.24 increment in delta SF-12-physical component summary scores. answer: The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.	yes
question: Is the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol able to reduce the dosages of chemotherapeutices in the treatment of human ovarian cancer? context: The endogenous estradiol metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME), has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of cell growth and a strong anti-angiogenic substance. We investigated for the first time whether in vitro combinations of 2ME with various chemotherapeutic compounds may result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells. As a model two different human ovary cancer cell lines were used. All cell lines were incubated with equimolar concentrations of 2ME (0.8-25 microM) and the chemotherapeutics epirubicine, doxorubicine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil and mafosfamide. Proliferation was measured after four days using the ATP-chemosensitivity test. For both ovary cancer cell lines a significant additive effect of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin was observed at the lower concentration range of these chemotherapeutic substances. answer: 2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.	yes
question: Does a dedicated discharge coordinator improve the quality of hospital discharge? context: To evaluate the effectiveness of the role of a discharge coordinator whose sole responsibility was to plan and coordinate the discharge of patients from medical wards. An intervention study in which the quality of discharge planning was assessed before and after the introduction of a discharge coordinator. Patients were interviewed on the ward before discharge and seven to 10 days after being discharged home. The three medical wards at the Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London. 600 randomly sampled adult patients admitted to the medical wards of the study hospital, who were resident in the district (but not in institutions), were under the care of physicians (excluding psychiatry), and were discharged home from one of the medical wards. The sampling was conducted in three study phases, over 18 months. Phase I comprised base line data collection; in phase II data were collected after the introduction of the district discharge planning policy and a discharge form (checklist) for all patients; in phase III data were collected after the introduction of the discharge coordinator. The quality and out come of discharge planning. Readmission rates, duration of stay, appropriateness of days of care, patients' health and satisfaction, problems after discharge, and receipt of services. The discharge coordinator resulted in an improved discharge planning process, and there was a reduction in problems experienced by patients after discharge, and in perceived need for medical and healthcare services. There was no evidence that the discharge coordinator resulted in a more timely or effective provision of community services after discharge, or that the appropriateness or efficiency of bed use was improved. answer: The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.	yes
question: Impact of MPH programs: contributing to health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries? context: The "health workforce" crisis has led to an increased interest in health professional education, including MPH programs. Recently, it was questioned whether training of mid- to higher level cadres in public health prepared graduates with competencies to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Measuring educational impact has been notoriously difficult; therefore, innovative methods for measuring the outcome and impact of MPH programs were sought. Impact was conceptualized as "impact on workplace" and "impact on society," which entailed studying how these competencies were enacted and to what effect within the context of the graduates' workplaces, as well as on societal health. This is part of a larger six-country mixed method study; in this paper, the focus is on the qualitative findings of two English language programs, one a distance MPH program offered from South Africa, the other a residential program in the Netherlands. Both offer MPH training to students from a diversity of countries. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 graduates (per program), working in low- and middle-income health systems, their peers, and their supervisors. Impact on the workplace was reported as considerable by graduates and peers as well as supervisors and included changes in management and leadership: promotion to a leadership position as well as expanded or revitalized management roles were reported by many participants. The development of leadership capacity was highly valued amongst many graduates, and this capacity was cited by a number of supervisors and peers. Wider impact in the workplace took the form of introducing workplace innovations such as setting up an AIDS and addiction research center and research involvement; teaching and training, advocacy, and community engagement were other ways in which graduates' influence reached a wider target grouping. Beyond the workplace, an intersectoral approach, national reach through policy advisory roles to Ministries of Health, policy development, and capacity building, was reported. Work conditions and context influenced conduciveness for innovation and the extent to which graduates were able to have effect. Self-selection of graduates and their role in selecting peers and supervisors may have resulted in some bias, some graduates could not be traced, and social acceptability bias may have influenced findings. answer: There was considerable impact at many levels; graduates were perceived to be able to contribute significantly to their workplaces and often had influence at the national level. Much of the impact described was in line with public health educational aims. The qualitative method study revealed more in-depth understanding of graduates' impact as well as their career pathways.	yes
question: Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities: Are they detected by rapid prescreening? context: Rapid prescreening (RPS) is one of the quality assurance (QA) methods used in gynecologic cytology. The efficacy of RPS has been previously studied but mostly with respect to squamous lesions; in fact, there has been no study so far specifically looking at the sensitivity of RPS for detecting glandular cell abnormalities. A total of 80,565 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears underwent RPS during a 25-month period. A sample was designated as "review for abnormality" (R) if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given a cytologic interpretation. The final cytologic interpretation was a glandular cell abnormality (≥AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on RPS. Notably, 11 AGC cases were picked up by RPS only and not by FS and represented false-negative cases; 2 of these showed endometrial adenocarcinoma on histologic follow-up. answer: Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities are often flagged as abnormal by RPS, and this results in a sensitivity of 36.4% (at the AGC threshold). Most importantly, some cases of AGC are detected on Pap smears by RPS only, and this demonstrates that RPS is a valuable QA method.	yes
question: Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients? context: Disorders of consciousness (DOC) diagnosis relies on the presence or absence of purposeful motor responsiveness, which characterizes the minimally conscious state (MCS) and the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), respectively. Functional neuroimaging studies have raised the question of possible residual conscious awareness also in clinically-defined UWS patients. The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even when no conscious behavior can be observed. We enrolled 25 severe DOC patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex. a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. answer: a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.	yes
question: Is etoricoxib effective in preventing heterotopic ossification after primary total hip arthroplasty? context: Heterotopic ossification is a common complication after total hip arthroplasty. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to prevent heterotopic ossifications effectively, however gastrointestinal complaints are reported frequently. In this study, we investigated whether etoricoxib, a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor that produces fewer gastrointestinal side effects, is an effective alternative for the prevention of heterotopic ossification. We investigated the effectiveness of oral etoricoxib 90 mg for seven days in a prospective two-stage study design for phase-2 clinical trials in a small sample of patients (n = 42). A cemented primary total hip arthroplasty was implanted for osteoarthritis. Six months after surgery, heterotopic ossification was determined on anteroposterior pelvic radiographs using the Brooker classification. No heterotopic ossification was found in 62 % of the patients that took etoricoxib; 31 % of the patients had Brooker grade 1 and 7 % Brooker grade 2 ossification. answer: Etoricoxib seems effective in preventing heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty. This finding further supports the use of COX-2 inhibitors for the prevention of heterotopic ossification following total hip arthroplasty.	yes
question: Assessing Patient Reported Outcomes Measures via Phone Interviews Versus Patient Self-Survey in the Clinic: Are We Measuring the Same Thing? context: Longitudinally following patients requires a full-time employee (FTE)-dependent data inflow infrastructure. There are efforts to capture patient-reported outcomes (PROs) by the use of non-FTE-dependent methodologies. In this study, we set out to assess the reliability of PRO data captured via FTE-dependent compared with non-FTE-dependent methodologies. A total of 119 adult patients (65 men) who underwent 1-and 2-level lumbar fusions at Duke University Medical Center were enrolled in this prospective study. Enrollment criteria included available demographic, clinical, and PRO data. All patients completed 2 sets of questionnaires--the first a phone interviews and the second a self-survey. There was at least a 2-week period between the phone interviews and self-survey. Questionnaires included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the visual analog scale for back pain (VAS-BP), and the visual analog scale for leg pain (VAS-LP). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the reliability of baseline PRO data captured. A total of 39.49% of patients were smokers, 21.00% had diabetes, and 11.76% had coronary artery disease; 26.89% reported history of anxiety disorder, and 28.57% reported history of depression. A total of 97.47% of patients had a high-school diploma or General Education Development, and 49.57% attained a 4-year college degree or postgraduate degree. We observed a high correlation between baseline PRO data captured between FTE-dependent versus non-FTE dependent methodologies (ODI: r = -0.89, VAS-BP: r = 0.74, VAS-LP: r = 0.70). There was no difference in PROs of baseline pain and functional disability between FTE-dependent and non-FTE-dependent methodologies: baseline ODI (FTE-dependent: 47.73 ± 16.77 [mean ± SD] vs. non-FTE-dependent: 45.81 ± 12.11, P = 0.39), VAS-LP (FTE-dependent: 6.13 ± 2.78 vs. non-FTE-dependent: 6.46 ± 2.79, P = 0.36) and VAS-BP (FTE-dependent: 6.33 ± 2.90 vs. non-FTE-dependent: 6.53 ± 2.48, P = 0.57). answer: Our study suggests that there is great reliability between PRO data captured between FTE-dependent and non-FTE-dependent methodologies.	yes
question: Can emergency physicians accurately and reliably assess acute vertigo in the emergency department? context: To validate a clinical diagnostic tool, used by emergency physicians (EPs), to diagnose the central cause of patients presenting with vertigo, and to determine interrater reliability of this tool. A convenience sample of adult patients presenting to a single academic ED with isolated vertigo (i.e. vertigo without other neurological deficits) was prospectively evaluated with STANDING (SponTAneousNystagmus, Direction, head Impulse test, standiNG) by five trained EPs. The first step focused on the presence of spontaneous nystagmus, the second on the direction of nystagmus, the third on head impulse test and the fourth on gait. The local standard practice, senior audiologist evaluation corroborated by neuroimaging when deemed appropriate, was considered the reference standard. Sensitivity and specificity of STANDING were calculated. On the first 30 patients, inter-observer agreement among EPs was also assessed. Five EPs with limited experience in nystagmus assessment volunteered to participate in the present study enrolling 98 patients. Their average evaluation time was 9.9 ± 2.8 min (range 6-17). Central acute vertigo was suspected in 16 (16.3%) patients. There were 13 true positives, three false positives, 81 true negatives and one false negative, with a high sensitivity (92.9%, 95% CI 70-100%) and specificity (96.4%, 95% CI 93-38%) for central acute vertigo according to senior audiologist evaluation. The Cohen's kappas of the first, second, third and fourth steps of the STANDING were 0.86, 0.93, 0.73 and 0.78, respectively. The whole test showed a good inter-observer agreement (k = 0.76, 95% CI 0.45-1). answer: In the hands of EPs, STANDING showed a good inter-observer agreement and accuracy validated against the local standard of care.	yes
question: Proof of concept study: does fenofibrate have a role in sleep apnoea syndrome? context: To investigate the effect of fenofibrate on sleep apnoea indices. Proof-of-concept study comprising a placebo run-in period (1 week, 5 weeks if fibrate washout was required) and a 4-week randomized, double-blind treatment period. Thirty-four subjects (mean age 55 years, body mass index 34 kg/m 2 , fasting triglycerides 3.5 mmol/L) with diagnosed sleep apnoea syndrome not treated with continuous positive airways pressure were enrolled and randomized to once daily treatment with fenofibrate (145 mg NanoCrystal(R) tablet) or placebo. Overnight polysomnography, computerized attention/vigilance tests and blood sampling for measurement of lipids, insulin, fasting plasma glucose and fibrinogen were performed at the end of each study period. NCT00816829. As this was an exploratory study, a range of sleep variables were evaluated. The apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) and percentage of time spent with arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2))<90% were relevant as they have been evaluated in other clinical trials. Other variables included total apnoeas, hypopnoeas and oxygen desaturations, and non-cortical micro-awakenings related to respiratory events per hour. Fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced the percentage of time with SpO(2)<90% (from 9.0% to 3.5% vs. 10.0% to 11.5% with placebo, p = 0.007), although there was no significant change in the AHI (reduction vs. control 14% (95%CI -47 to 40%, p = 0.533). Treatment reduced obstructive apnoeas (by 44%, from 18.5 at baseline to 15.0 at end of treatment vs. 29.0 to 30.5 on placebo, p = 0.048), and non-cortical micro-awakenings per hour (from 23.5 to 18.0 vs. 24.0 to 25.0 with placebo, p = 0.004). Other sleep variables were not significantly influenced by fenofibrate. Exploratory study in patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea, limited treatment duration; concomitant hypnotic treatment (35%); lack of correction for multiplicity of testing. answer: The consistent direction of change in sleep indices in this proof-of-concept study may support further investigation of fenofibrate in moderate to severe sleep apnoea syndrome.	yes
question: Does implant coating with antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro? context: Implant-related infections represent one of the most severe complications in orthopaedics. A fast-resorbable, antibacterial-loaded hydrogel may reduce or prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation of implanted biomaterials.QUESTIONS/ We asked: (1) Is a fast-resorbable hydrogel able to deliver antibacterial compounds in vitro? (2) Can a hydrogel (alone or antibacterial-loaded) coating on implants reduce bacterial colonization? And (3) is intraoperative coating feasible and resistant to press-fit implant insertion? We tested the ability of Disposable Antibacterial Coating (DAC) hydrogel (Novagenit Srl, Mezzolombardo, Italy) to deliver antibacterial agents using spectrophotometry and a microbiologic assay. Antibacterial and antibiofilm activity were determined by broth microdilution and a crystal violet assay, respectively. Coating resistance to press-fit insertion was tested in rabbit tibias and human femurs. Complete release of all tested antibacterial compounds was observed in less than 96 hours. Bactericidal and antibiofilm effect of DAC hydrogel in combination with various antibacterials was shown in vitro. Approximately 80% of the hydrogel coating was retrieved on the implant after press-fit insertion. answer: Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.	yes
question: Does bone anchor fixation improve the outcome of percutaneous bladder neck suspension in female stress urinary incontinence? context: To evaluate the outcome of a new modification of percutaneous needle suspension, using a bone anchor system for fixing the suture at the public bone, and to compare the results with those published previously. From March 1996, 37 patients with stress urinary incontinence (>2 years) were treated using a bone anchor system. On each side the suture was attached to the pubocervical fascia and the vaginal wall via a broad 'Z'-stitch. A urodynamic investigation performed preoperatively in all patients confirmed stress incontinence and excluded detrusor instability. The outcome was assessed by either by a clinical follow-up investigation or using a standardized questionnaire, over a mean follow-up of 11 months (range 6-18). In the 37 patients, the procedure was successful in 25 (68%), with 16 (43%) of the patients completely dry and nine (24%) significantly improved. Removal of the bone anchor and suture was necessary in two patients, because of unilateral bacterial infection in one and a bilateral soft tissue granuloma in the other. One bone anchor became dislocated in a third patient. In two cases where the treatment failed, new detrusor instability was documented urodynamically. Minor complications were prolonged wound pain in 10 (26%) and transient urinary retention or residual urine in 12 patients (32%). answer: The poor success rate in the study corresponds with the long-term results of conventional or modified needle suspension procedures and does not reinforce the optimistic results of bone anchoring published recently. Because of the poorer long-term results from percutaneous needle suspension than from other techniques of open retropubic bladder neck suspension, it remains questionable whether percutaneous needle suspension should be considered a first-line procedure for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence.	yes
question: Is leptin involved in phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity? context: Hyperleptinemia and oxidative stress play a major role in the development of cardiovascular diseases in obesity. This study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, and its potential relevance in the vascular remodeling in obese patients. The study was performed in 164 obese and 94 normal-weight individuals (controls). NADPH oxidase activity was evaluated by luminescence in phagocytic cells. Levels of leptin were quantified by ELISA in plasma samples. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, we performed in-vitro experiments in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophages. Phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and leptin levels were enhanced (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. NADPH oxidase activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients. This association remained significant in a multivariate analysis. cIMT was higher (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. In addition, cIMT also correlated positively with leptin and NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. In-vitro studies showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of the leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activity by wortmannin and bisindolyl maleimide suggested a direct involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C pathways, respectively. Finally, leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activation promoted macrophage proliferation. answer: These findings show that phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity is increased in obesity and is related to preclinical atherosclerosis in this condition. We also suggest that hyperleptinemia may contribute to phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity.	yes
question: Can we predict which head and neck cancer survivors develop fears of recurrence? context: The objectives of this study were to investigate longitudinal predictors of fear of recurrence in survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC) using Leventhal's Common Sense Model (CSM) as a framework. The research questions were as follows: (a) to what extent do HNC patients report fear of cancer recurrence? (b) To what extent are fears of recurrence manifestations of illness-related anxiety? (c) Are fears of recurrence closely related to current symptoms, disease, and treatment-related factors, or psychological/socio-demographic factors? (d) What factors are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence? A prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample of 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age 60 years) completed measures of fears of recurrence, illness perceptions, coping, and anxiety and depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months after treatment (fears of recurrence only). A third of HNC patients at diagnosis reported relatively high levels of fears of recurrence, with 12% still reporting similar levels of fear 6-8 months after treatment. Fears of recurrence were not related to any socio-demographic factor (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment) or disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors. Path analyses demonstrated that fears of cancer recurrence after treatment were directly predicted by pre-treatment fears and optimism. answer: Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.	yes
question: Differentiation of nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis: are routine laboratory markers useful? context: Specific markers for differentiation of nonalcoholic (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) are lacking. We investigated the role of routine laboratory parameters in distinguishing NASH from ASH. Liver biopsies performed at our hospital over a 10-year period were reviewed, 95 patients with steatohepatitis identified and their data prior to biopsy reevaluated. The diagnosis NASH or ASH was assigned (other liver diseases excluded) on the basis of the biopsy and history of alcohol consumption (<140 g/week). Logistic regression models were used for analysis. NASH was diagnosed in 58 patients (61%; 30 f) and ASH in 37 (39%; 9 f). High-grade fibrosis (59% vs. 19%, P<0.0001) and an AST/ALT ratio>1 (54.1% vs 20.7%, P = 0.0008) were more common in ASH. The MCV was elevated in 53% of ASH patients and normal in all NASH patients (P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the MCV (P = 0.0013), the AST/ALT ratio (P = 0.011) and sex (P = 0.0029) as relevant regressors (aROC = 0.92). The AST/ALT ratio (P<0.0001) and age (P = 0.00049) were independent predictors of high-grade fibrosis. Differences in MCV were more marked in high-grade fibrosis. answer: Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.	yes
question: Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic trauma severity? context: Traumatic aortic injury (TAI) is a rare but life-threatening type of injury. We investigate whether the anatomy of the aortic arch influences the severity of aortic injury. This is a retrospective study of twenty-two cases treated with TEVAR for TAI in our department from 2009 to 2014. Aortic injury was assessed in accordance with the recommendations of the Society of Vascular Surgery. We measured the aortic arch angle and the aortic arch index, based on the initial angio-CT scan, in each of the analyzed cases. The mean aortic arch index and mean aortic arch angle were 6.8 cm and 58.3°, respectively, in the type I injury group; 4.4 cm and 45.9° in the type III group; 3.3 cm and 37° in the type IV group. There were substantial differences in both the aortic arch index and the aortic arch angle of the type III and IV groups. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the aortic arch angle was significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.2). answer: The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.	yes
question: The Prevalence of Incidentally Detected Idiopathic Misty Mesentery on Multidetector Computed Tomography: Can Obesity Be the Triggering Cause? context: Misty mesentery appearance is commonly reported in daily practice, usually as a secondary finding of various pathological entities, but sometimes it is encountered as an isolated finding that cannot be attributed to any other disease entity. We aimed to assess the prevalence of cases with incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on computed tomography (CT) and to summarize the pathologies leading to this appearance. Medical records and initial and follow-up CT features of patients with misty mesentery appearance between January 2011 and January 2013 were analysed. The study included cases with no known cause of misty mesentery according to associated CT findings, clinical history, or biochemical manifestations, and excluded patients with diseases known to cause misty mesentery, lymph nodes greater than a short-axis diameter of 5 mm, discrete mesenteric masses, or bowel wall thickening. There were a total of 561 patients in whom misty mesentery appearance was depicted on abdominopelvic CT scans. A total of 80 cases were found to have isolated incidental idiopathic misty mesentery, giving a prevalence of 7%. The common indication for CT examination was abdominal pain. There was a slight female predominance (51.3%). 67.5% of all patients were classified as obese and 17.5% as overweight. answer: The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.	yes
question: Fast foods - are they a risk factor for asthma? context: Lifestyle changes over the last 30 years are the most likely explanation for the increase in allergic disease over this period.AIM: This study tests the hypothesis that the consumption of fast food is related to the prevalence of asthma and allergy. As part of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) a cross-sectional prevalence study of 1321 children (mean age = 11.4 years, range: 10.1-12.5) was conducted in Hastings, New Zealand. Using standard questions we collected data on the prevalence of asthma and asthma symptoms, as well as food frequency data. Skin prick tests were performed to common environmental allergens and exercise-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was assessed according to a standard protocol. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height2 (kg/m2) and classified into overweight and obese according to a standard international definition. After adjusting for lifestyle factors, including other diet and BMI variables, compared with children who never ate hamburgers, we found an independent risk of hamburger consumption on having a history of wheeze [consumption less than once a week (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06-1.96) and 1+ times a week (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.07-2.52)] and on current wheeze [consumption less than once a week (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.80-1.70) and 1+ times a week (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.10-2.98)]. Takeaway consumption 1+ times a week was marginally significantly related to BHR (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 0.99-5.91). There was no effect on atopy. answer: Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a similar association with BHR.	yes
question: Assessment of appropriate antimicrobial prescribing: do experts agree? context: Little is known about the validity and reliability of expert assessments of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, despite their importance in antimicrobial stewardship. We investigated how infectious disease doctors' assessments compared with a reference standard (modal expert opinion) and with the assessments of their colleagues. Twenty-four doctors specialized in infectious diseases or clinical microbiology (16 specialists and 8 residents) from five hospitals were asked to assess the appropriateness of antimicrobial agents prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications in 56 paper cases. They were instructed how to handle guideline applicability and deviations. We created a reference standard of antimicrobial appropriateness using the modal assessment of 16 specialists. We calculated criterion validity and interrater and intrarater overall and specific agreement with an index expert (senior infectious disease physician) and analysed the influence of doctor characteristics on validity. Specialists agreed with the reference standard in 80% of cases (range 75%-86%), with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 84%, respectively. This did not differ by clinical specialty, hospital or years of experience, and residents had similar results. Specialists agreed with the index expert in 76% of cases and the index expert agreed with his previous assessments in 71% of cases. answer: Doctors specialized in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology assess the appropriateness of antimicrobials prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications with acceptable agreement and validity, regardless of their experience or hospital of employment. However, there is room for improvement, which merits attention in multidisciplinary discussions and education.	yes
question: Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot: are we operating too late? context: The purpose of this study is to evaluate right ventricular (RV) volume and function after pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) and to address the issue of optimal surgical timing in these patients. Chronic pulmonary regurgitation (PR) following repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) leads to RV dilation and an increased incidence of sudden cardiac death in adult patients. We studied 25 consecutive adult patients who underwent PVR for significant PR late after repair of TOF. Radionuclide angiography was performed in all at a mean of 8.2 months (+/- 8 months) before PVR and repeated at a mean of 28.0 months (+/- 22.8 months) after the operation. Right ventricular (RV) end-systolic volume (RVESV), RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) were measured. Mean RVEDV, RVESV and RVEF remained unchanged after PVR (227.1 ml versus 214.9 ml, p = 0.74; 157.4 ml versus 155.4 ml, p = 0.94; 35.6% versus 34.7%, p = 0.78, respectively). Of the 10 patients with RVEF>or = 0.40 before PVR, 5 patients (50%) maintained a RVEF>or = 0.40 following PVR, whereas only 2 out of 15 patients (13%) with pre-operative values<0.40 reached an RVEF>or = 0.40 postoperatively (p<0.001). answer: Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.	yes
question: Is amoxapine an atypical antipsychotic? context: All currently available atypical antipsychotics have, at clinically relevant doses: i) high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy; ii) greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy; and iii) a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when their D2 occupancy exceeds 80%. A review of pharmacologic and behavioral data suggested that amoxapine should also conform to this profile; therefore, we undertook a positron-emission tomography (PET) study of its 5-HT2 and D2 occupancy. Seven healthy volunteers received 50-250 mg/day of amoxapine for 5 days and then had [11C]-raclopride and [18F]-setoperone PET scans. 5-HT2 receptors showed near saturation at doses of 100 mg/day and above. The D2 receptor occupancies showed a dose-dependent increase, never exceeding 80%; at all doses 5-HT2 occupancy exceeded D2 occupancy. answer: PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an "atypical" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.	yes
question: Do older patients who refuse to participate in a self-management intervention in the Netherlands differ from older patients who agree to participate? context: Refusal of patients to participate in intervention programs is an important problem in clinical trials but, in general, researchers devote relatively little attention to it. In this article, a comparison is made between patients who, after having been invited, agreed to participate in a self-management intervention (participants) and those who refused (refusers). Compared with other studies of refusers, relatively more information could be gathered with regard to both their characteristics and reasons for refusing, because all potential participants were invited personally. Older patients from a Dutch outpatient clinic were invited to participate in a self-management intervention, and their characteristics were assessed. Demographic data were collected, as well as data on physical functioning and lack of emotional support. People who refused to participate were asked to give their reasons for refusing. Of the 361 patients invited, 267 (74%) refused participation. These refusers were more restricted in their mobility, lived further away from the location of the intervention, and had a partner more often than did the participants. No differences were found in level of education, age or gender. The main reasons given by respondents for refusing to participate were lack of time, travel distance, and transport problems. answer: As in many studies, the refusal rate in this study is high, and seems to be related to physical mobility restrictions, travel distance and, partly, to availability of emotional support. These findings may be used to make the recruitment process more effective - for example, by offering transport to the location of the intervention.	yes
question: Is horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex influenced by otolith organs input? context: To clarify whether horizontal canal ocular reflex is influenced by otolith organs input. The subjects were seven healthy humans. The right ear was stimulated using ice-water. Each subject was kept in a left-ear-down position for 20 s and then repositioned to a prone position, a right-ear-down position and a supine position with 20 s intervals. Nystagmus was analysed using three-dimensional video-oculography. Eye movements in the supine position and the prone position were not in a symmetric fashion. Nystagmus in the left-ear-down position and the right-ear-down position were not symmetric either. These phenomena indicate that the axis of the eyeball rotation was affected by the shift of the direction of gravity exerted on the head. answer: Otolith organs input influences the axis of horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex; therefore, the plane of compensatory eye movements induced by the horizontal canal stimulation is not always parallel to the canal.	yes
question: Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia: does it matter? context: Despite surgical refinements, perioperative use of tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) as part of surgical approach to esophageal atresia (EA) is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of preoperative TBS in newborns with EA in preventing complications and improving diagnosis and surgical treatment. In the period ranging from 1997 to 2003, 62 patients with EA underwent preoperative TBS. The procedure was carried out with flexible bronchoscope maintaining spontaneous breathing. When a wide carinal fistula was found, this was mechanically occluded by Fogarty catheter and cannulated with rigid bronchoscopy. Type of EA, surgical procedure variations caused by TBS, and associated anomalies not easily detectable were recorded. Before TBS, the Gross classification of the 62 patients was as follows: type A, 9 patients; type B, none; type C, 51 patients. At TBS, however, 3 of 9 type A patients had an unsuspected proximal fistula (type B). These 3 patients, plus the 2 with H-type fistula, were repaired through a cervical approach. In 4 patients, previously undetected malformations of the respiratory tree (2 aberrant right upper bronchus and 2 hypoplastic bronchi) were found at TBS. Carinal fistulas in 14 type C patients were occluded by Fogarty catheter to improve ventilation during repair. No complications were observed. Overall, TBS was clinically useful in 28 (45.2%) of 62 patients, including 15 (24.2%) of 62 infants in whom it was crucial in modifying the surgical approach. answer: Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.	yes
question: Is it appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients? context: Kidneys from elderly donors tend to be implanted in recipients who are also elderly. We present the results obtained after 10 years of evolution on transplanting elderly kidneys into young recipients. Ninety-one consecutive transplants are studied, carried out in our center with kidneys from cadaver donors older than 60 years implanted in recipients younger than 60 years. The control group is made up of 91 transplants, matched with those from the study group, whose donor and recipient were younger than 60 years. There were no differences between groups with regard to recipient age, sex, cause of death and renal function of the donor, hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus serologies, cold ischemia time, tubular necrosis, immediate diuresis, need for dialysis, human leukocyte antigen incompatibilities, hypersensitized patients, acute rejection, waiting time on dialysis, and days of admission. Survival in both groups at 1, 5, and 10 years was 97.6%, 87.2%, and 76.6% vs. 98.8%, 87.5%, and 69.5% for the patient (P=0.642), 92.9%, 81.3%, and 64.2% vs. 93.9%, 76.4%, and 69.5% for the graft (P=0.980), and 94.4%, 92.6%, and 77.4% vs. 94.3%, 86.7%, and 84.4% for the graft with death censured (P=0.747), respectively. Creatininaemias at 1, 5, and 10 years were 172, 175, and 210 vs. 139, 134, and 155 (P<0.05). answer: We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.	yes
question: Is muscle power related to running speed with changes of direction? context: The purpose of this study was to identify the relationships between leg muscle power and sprinting speed with changes of direction. the study was designed to describe relationships between physical qualities and a component of sports performance. testing was conducted in an indoor sports hall and a biomechanics laboratory. 15 male participants were required to be free of injury and have recent experience competing in sports involving sprints with changes of direction. subjects were timed in 8 m sprints in a straight line and with various changes of direction. They were also tested for bilateral and unilateral leg extensor muscle concentric power output by an isokinetic squat and reactive strength by a drop jump. The correlations between concentric power and straight sprinting speed were non-significant whereas the relationships between reactive strength and straight speed were statistically significant. Correlations between muscle power and speed while changing direction were generally low and non-significant for concentric leg power with some moderate and significant (p<0.05) coefficients found for reactive strength. The participants who turned faster to one side tended to have a reactive strength dominance in the leg responsible for the push-off action. answer: The relationships between leg muscle power and change-of-direction speed were not consistent. Reactive strength as measured by the drop jump appears to have some importance for lateral change-of-direction speed, possibly because of similar push-off actions. It was concluded that reactive strength of the leg extensor muscles has some importance in change-of-direction performance but the other technical and perceptual factors than influence agility performance should also be considered.	yes
question: Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation? context: This study sought to evaluate mutations in genes encoding the slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) channel in familial atrial fibrillation (AF). Although AF can have a genetic etiology, links between inherited gene defects and acquired factors such as atrial stretch have not been explored. Mutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNE3 genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological studies and human atrial action potential modeling. One missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration. answer: These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a "second hit", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the "first hit"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.	yes
question: Are pelvic anatomical structures in danger during arthroscopic acetabular labral repair? context: The purpose of this study was to evaluate safe depth for suture anchor insertion during acetabular labral repair and to determine the neighbouring structures at risk during drilling and anchor insertion. Ten human cadaveric hips (six males and four females) were obtained. Acetabular labral surface was prepared and marked for right hips as 12, 1 and 3 o'clock positions, for left hips 12, 11 and 9 o'clock positions. Those were defined as anterior, anterior-superior and superior zones, respectively. These labral positions were drilled at defined zones. After measurements, depth of the bone at 10° and 20° drill angles on zones was compared statistically. Acetabular bone widths at investigated labral insertion points did not statistically differ. A total of 14 injuries in 60 penetrations occurred (23.3 %) with free drill penetrations, and no injuries occurred with stopped drill penetrations. The bone depth was gradually decreasing from 10° to 20° drill angles and from anterior to superior inserting zones without significant importance. The risk of perforation to the pelvic cavity started with 20 mm drill depth, and the mean depth for all insertions was calculated as 31.7 mm (SD 2.6). answer: It is anatomically possible that some pelvic structures sustain iatrogenic injury during acetabular drilling for anchor placement. Being aware of mean pelvic vault is important in which drilling after excessive pincer rim trimming could easily decrease the depth of acetabular bone without a standard. Careful drilling by using stopped drill bit is crucial to prevent iatrogenic injury.	yes
question: Is intraoperative neuromonitoring associated with better functional outcome in patients undergoing open TME? context: Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) aims to control nerve-sparing total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer in order to improve patients' functional outcome. This study was designed to compare the urogenital and anorectal functional outcome of TME with and without IONM of innervation to the bladder and the internal anal sphincter. A consecutive series of 150 patients with primary rectal cancer were analysed. Fifteen match pairs with open TME and combined urogenital and anorectal functional assessment at follow up were established identical regarding gender, tumour site, tumour stage, neoadjuvant radiotherapy and type of surgery. Urogenital and anorectal function was evaluated prospectively on the basis of self-administered standardized questionnaires, measurement of residual urine volume and longterm-catheterization rate. Newly developed urinary dysfunction after surgery was reported by 1 of 15 patients in the IONM group and by 6 of 15 in the control group (p = 0.031). Postoperative residual urine volume was significantly higher in the control group. At follow up impaired anorectal function was present in 1 of 15 patients undergoing TME with IONM and in 6 of 15 without IONM (p = 0.031). The IONM group showed a trend towards a lower rate of sexual dysfunction after surgery. answer: In this study TME with IONM was associated with significant lower rates of urinary and anorectal dysfunction. Prospective randomized trials are mandatory to evaluate the definite role of IONM in rectal cancer surgery.	yes
question: Profiling quality of care: Is there a role for peer review? context: We sought to develop a more reliable structured implicit chart review instrument for use in assessing the quality of care for chronic disease and to examine if ratings are more reliable for conditions in which the evidence base for practice is more developed. We conducted a reliability study in a cohort with patient records including both outpatient and inpatient care as the objects of measurement. We developed a structured implicit review instrument to assess the quality of care over one year of treatment. 12 reviewers conducted a total of 496 reviews of 70 patient records selected from 26 VA clinical sites in two regions of the country. Each patient had between one and four conditions specified as having a highly developed evidence base (diabetes and hypertension) or a less developed evidence base (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a collection of acute conditions). Multilevel analysis that accounts for the nested and cross-classified structure of the data was used to estimate the signal and noise components of the measurement of quality and the reliability of implicit review. For COPD and a collection of acute conditions the reliability of a single physician review was quite low (intra-class correlation = 0.16-0.26) but comparable to most previously published estimates for the use of this method in inpatient settings. However, for diabetes and hypertension the reliability is significantly higher at 0.46. The higher reliability is a result of the reviewers collectively being able to distinguish more differences in the quality of care between patients (p<0.007) and not due to less random noise or individual reviewer bias in the measurement. For these conditions the level of true quality (i.e. the rating of quality of care that would result from the full population of physician reviewers reviewing a record) varied from poor to good across patients. answer: For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.	yes
question: Multidisciplinary decisions in breast cancer: does the patient receive what the team has recommended? context: A multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach to breast cancer management is the gold standard. The aim is to evaluate MDT decision making in a modern breast unit. All referrals to the breast MDT where breast cancer was diagnosed from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2011 were included. Multidisciplinary team decisions were compared with subsequent patient management and classified as concordant or discordant. Over the study period, there were 3230 MDT decisions relating to 705 patients. Overall, 91.5% (2956 out of 3230) of decisions were concordant, 4.5% (146 out of 3230), were discordant and 4% (128 out of 3230) had no MDT decision. Of 146 discordant decisions, 26 (17.8%) were considered 'unjustifiable' as there was no additional information available after the MDT to account for the change in management. The remaining 120 discordant MDT decisions were considered 'justifiable', as management was altered due to patient choice (n=61), additional information available after MDT (n=54) or MDT error (n=5). answer: The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.	yes
question: Are performance measurement systems useful? context: Prior literature identified the use of Performance Measurement Systems (PMS) as crucial in addressing improved processes of care. Moreover, a strategic use of PMS has been found to enhance quality, compared to non-strategic use, although a clear understanding of this linkage is still to be achieved. This paper deals with the test of direct and indirect models related to the link between the strategic use of PMS and the level of improved processes in health care organizations. Indirect models were mediated by the degree of perceived managerial discretion. A PLS analysis on a survey of 97 Italian managers working for health care organizations in the Lombardy region was conducted. The response rate was 77.6%. The strategic use of PMS in health care organizations directly and significantly (p < 0.001) enhances performance in terms of improved processes. Perceived managerial discretion is positively and significantly (p < 0.001) affected by the strategic use of PMS, whereas the mediation effect is non-significant. answer: This study contributes to the literature investigating the design and implementation of a non-financial measurement tool, such as the non-financial information included into a balanced scorecard (BSC), in health care organizations. Managers in health care organizations can benefit from the strategic use of PMS to effectively allocate their time to strategic opportunities and threats, which might arise and affect organizational, output-related performance, such as improving processes.	yes
question: The colour of pain: can patients use colour to describe osteoarthritis pain? context: The aim of the present study was to explore patients' views on the acceptability and feasibility of using colour to describe osteoarthritis (OA) pain, and whether colour could be used to communicate pain to healthcare professionals. Six group interviews were conducted with 17 patients with knee OA. Discussion topics included first impressions about using colour to describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals. The group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using colour was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours. The majority of participants thought that they would be able to use colour to describe their pain to healthcare professionals, although issues around the interpretability and standardization of colour were raised. answer: For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.	yes
question: Do mossy fibers release GABA? context: Mossy fibers are the sole excitatory projection from dentate gyrus granule cells to the hippocampus, forming part of the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit. They undergo significant plasticity during epileptogenesis and have been implicated in seizure generation. Mossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, zinc, and possibly other peptides. Mossy fiber terminals also show intense immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and immunoreactivity for GAD67. The purpose of this review is to present physiologic evidence of GABA release by mossy fibers and its modulation by epileptic activity. We used hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old guinea pigs and made whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells. We placed stimulating electrodes in stratum granulosum and adjusted their position in order to recruit mossy fiber to CA3 projections. We have shown that electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons. These inhibitory signals satisfy the criteria that distinguish mossy fiber-CA3 synapses: high sensitivity to metabotropic glutamate-receptor agonists, facilitation during repetitive stimulation, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-independent long-term potentiation. answer: We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.	yes
question: Is severe macrosomia manifested at 11-14 weeks of gestation? context: To determine the association between fetal biometry in the first or early second trimester and severe macrosomia at delivery. This case-control study included 30 term severely macrosomic neonates; 90 appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonates served as controls. All pregnancies underwent nuchal translucency (NT) screening at 11-14 weeks' gestation. Pregnancies were dated by accurate last menstrual period consistent with crown-rump length (CRL) measurements at the time of screening, early pregnancy CRL or date of fertilization. The association between birth weight and the difference between the measured and the expected CRL at the time of NT screening was analyzed. The difference between measured and expected CRL, expressed both in mm and in days of gestation, was statistically greater in the severely macrosomic neonates compared with controls (mean, 6.66 +/- 4.78 mm vs. 1.17 +/- 4.6 mm, P<0.0001 and 3 +/- 2.2 days vs. 0.5 +/- 2.3 days, P<0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, there were significant correlations between the extent of macrosomia and the discrepancy between expected and measured fetal size at the time of NT screening (r = 0.47, P<0.01 and r = 0.48, P<0.01, respectively). answer: Severe macrosomia apparently manifests as early as 11-14 weeks' gestation.	yes
question: Visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level: can it represent visceral adipose tissue volume? context: Measurement of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) needs to be accurate and sensitive to change for risk monitoring. The purpose of this study is to determine the CT slice location where VAT area can best reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. 60 plain abdominal CT images from 30 males [mean age (range) 51 (41-68) years, mean body weight (range) 71.1 (101.9-50.9) kg] who underwent workplace screenings twice within a 1-year interval were evaluated. Automatically calculated and manually corrected areas of the VAT of various scan levels using "freeform curve" region of interest on CT were recorded and compared with body weight changes. The strongest correlations of VAT area with VAT volume and body weight changes were shown in a slice 3 cm above the lower margin of L3 with r values of 0.853 and 0.902, respectively. answer: VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.	yes
question: Is an advance care planning model feasible in community palliative care? context: An effective advance care planning programme involves an organizational wide commitment and preparedness for health service reform to embed advance care planning into routine practice. Internationally, such programmes have been implemented predominantly in aged and acute care with more recent work in primary care. A multi-site action research was conducted over a 16-month period in 2007-2009 with three Victorian community palliative care services. Using mixed method data collection strategies to assess feasibility, we conducted a baseline audit of staff and clients; analysed relevant documents (client records, policies, procedures and quality improvement strategies) pre-implementation and post-implementation and conducted key informant interviews (n = 9). Three community palliative care services: one regional and two metropolitan services in Victoria, Australia. The services demonstrated that it was feasible to embed the Model into their organizational structures. Advance care planning conversations and involvement of family was an important outcome measure rather than completion rate of advance care planning documents in community settings. Services adapted and applied their own concept of community, which widened the impact of the model. Changes to quality audit processes were essential to consolidate the model into routine palliative care practice. answer: An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.	yes
question: Do cytokines have any role in epilepsy? context: We analyzed cytokines levels in patients with epilepsy and new onset seizure and correlated it with various parameters. After obtaining consent, serum samples from 100 patients with epilepsy or new onset seizure were prospectively collected in the immediate post-ictal phase. In 16 patients, a second sample was collected during the seizure-free period. The serum cytokine levels [TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6] were assessed (ELISA) in these patients and 100 matched healthy controls. CSF analysis was carried out in 9 patients of this cohort, when clinically indicated. The type of seizures (n=100) was major (45), partial (41) and status epilepticus (SE=14), while the epilepsy syndromes were idiopathic generalized (53) and localization related (47). The detectable serum cytokines in the patient group (n=100) were: IL-6 (42), TNF-alpha (36), IL-2 (22), IL-4 (22), IFN-gamma (20) and IL-1 (11) compared to the controls. CSF IL-6 and IL-1 was detectable in 4/9 and 2/9 patients, respectively while, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma was detectable 1 in each patient. Correlations were noted between male gender and IL-1beta (p=0.04), positive family history and IL-1beta (p=0.001), "no alcohol use" and TNF-alpha (p=0.05), more than one year history of epilepsy and IL-1beta (p=0.02), status epilepticus (SE) and IL-6 (p=0.04). There was no difference between the new onset seizures vs. epilepsy group. Serial analysis during the seizure-free period revealed a decrease in cytokine levels: TNF-alpha (25% to 12.5%), IFN-gamma (12.5% to 0%), IL-1 (25% to 0) and IL-2 (6.2% to 6.2%), IL-4 (18.8% to 0%) and IL-6 (18.8% to 6.2%). answer: We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.	yes
question: Is expert breast pathology assessment necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ ? context: Current guidelines include a recommendation that a pathologist with expertise in breast disease review all ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) specimens due to the presence of significant variability in pathologic reporting of DCIS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of pathologic reporting of DCIS over the past decade and to determine the current impact of expert breast pathology assessment on the management of DCIS. All patients with a diagnosis of DCIS referred to a single regional cancer centre between 1982 and 2000 have been reviewed. Inter-observer variability between initial and secondary reports has been evaluated using kappa statistics. For each case, the Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI) using pathologic data obtained from the initial and reviewed pathology reports were compared. The impact of expert breast pathology on risk assessment and treatment was determined. 481 individuals with DCIS were referred and pathology review was performed on 350 patients (73%). Inter-observer agreement was high for the main pathologic features of DCIS. From 1996 to 2000, secondary pathology assessments lead to a change in the assessment of local recurrence risk in 100 cases (29%) and contributed to a change in treatment recommendation in 93 (43%) cases. answer: Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.	yes
question: Treadmill testing of children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory: does peak oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake? context: Earlier studies have demonstrated low peak oxygen uptake ((.)Vo(2)peak) in children with spina bifida. Low peak heart rate and low peak respiratory exchange ratio in these studies raised questions regarding the true maximal character of (.)Vo(2)peak values obtained with treadmill testing. The aim of this study was to determine whether the Vo(2)peak measured during an incremental treadmill test is a true reflection of the maximum oxygen uptake ((.)Vo(2)max) in children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory. A cross-sectional design was used for this study. Twenty children who had spina bifida and were ambulatory participated. The (.)Vo(2)peak was measured during a graded treadmill exercise test. The validity of (.)Vo(2)peak measurements was evaluated by use of previously described guidelines for maximum exercise testing in children who are healthy, as well as differences between Vo(2)peak and (.)Vo(2) during a supramaximal protocol ((.)Vo(2)supramaximal). The average values for (.)Vo(2)peak and normalized (.)Vo(2)peak were, respectively, 1.23 L/min (SD=0.6) and 34.1 mL/kg/min (SD=8.3). Fifteen children met at least 2 of the 3 previously described criteria; one child failed to meet any criteria. Although there were no significant differences between (.)Vo(2)peak and Vo(2)supramaximal, 5 children did show improvement during supramaximal testing. These results apply to children who have spina bifida and are at least community ambulatory. answer: The (.)Vo(2)peak measured during an incremental treadmill test seems to reflect the true (.)Vo(2)max in children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory, validating the use of a treadmill test for these children. When confirmation of maximal effort is needed, the addition of supramaximal testing of children with disability is an easy and well-tolerated method.	yes
question: Subclavian steal syndrome: can the blood pressure difference between arms predict the severity of steal? context: A side-to-side difference in systolic brachial arterial blood pressure is a common finding in subclavian artery stenosis and is frequently used as a screening tool for subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). It was the goal of this retrospective study to investigate the relationship between different vertebral artery waveform types and the side-to-side difference in systolic blood pressure in patients with sonographically proven SSS. The records of 1860 patients from the Neuroultrasound Laboratory between January 2000 and December 2000 were screened for the diagnosis of SSS in the final ultrasound report. In all patients, bilateral brachial arterial blood pressure was measured in a sitting position prior to the ultrasound examination. Vertebral artery waveforms were classified as (1) systolic deceleration, (2) alternating flow, and (3) complete reversal at rest. Blood pressure difference as calculated by normal-side blood pressure minus lesion-side blood pressure was compared with the 3 Doppler waveform types. SSS was found in 51 of 1860 (2.7%) ultrasonography studies of 49 patients (17 men, 32 women; mean age 65.3 +/- 10.5 years). Two patients (4%) had bilateral SSS. In 3 patients (6%), SSS was related to an innominate artery stenosis. Waveform analysis showed a completely reversed flow in 16 (31%), an alternating flow in 24 (47%), and a systolic deceleration in 11 (22%) cases. Systolic blood pressure difference was significantly higher in the complete reversal and alternating groups than in the systolic deceleration group (P<.001). answer: Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.	yes
question: Is size-reducing ascending aortoplasty with external reinforcement an option in modern aortic surgery? context: Enlargement of the ascending aorta is often combined with valvular, coronary, or other cardiac diseases. Reduction aortoplasty can be an optional therapy; however, indications regarding the diameter of aorta, the history of dilatation (poststenosis, bicuspid aortic valve), or the intraoperative management (wall excision, reduction suture, external reinforcement) are not established. In a retrospective study between 1997 and 2005, we investigated 531 patients operated for aneurysm or ectasia of the ascending aorta (diameter: 45-76mm). Of these, in 50 patients, size-reducing ascending aortoplasty was performed. External reinforcement with a non-coated dacron prosthesis was added in order to stabilize the aortic wall. Aortoplasty was associated with aortic valve replacement in 47 cases (35 mechanical vs 12 biological), subvalvular myectomy in 29 cases, and CABG in 13 cases. The procedure was performed with low hospital mortality (2%) and a low postoperative morbidity. Computertomographic and echocardiographic diameters were significantly smaller after reduction (55.8+/-9mm down to 40.51+/-6.2mm (CT), p<0.002; 54.1+/-6.7mm preoperatively down to 38.7+/-7.1mm (echocardiography), p<0.002), with stable performance in long-term follow-up (mean follow-up time: 70 months). answer: As demonstrated in this study, size reduction of the ascending aorta using aortoplasty with external reinforcement is a safe procedure with excellent long-term results. It is a therapeutic option in modern aortic surgery in patients with poststenotic dilatation of the aorta without impairment of the sinotubular junction of the aortic valve and root.	yes
question: Is digoxin use for cardiovascular disease associated with risk of prostate cancer? context: Digoxin is a commonly used medication for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias that has recently been suggested as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk. Data from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression. One thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10). Among those with ≥3 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98). answer: These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.	yes
question: Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus: are the criteria proposed by the international association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups cost-effective? context: The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) recently recommended new criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study was undertaken to determine whether adopting the IADPSG criteria would be cost-effective, compared with the current standard of care. We developed a decision analysis model comparing the cost-utility of three strategies to identify GDM: 1) no screening, 2) current screening practice (1-h 50-g glucose challenge test between 24 and 28 weeks followed by 3-h 100-g glucose tolerance test when indicated), or 3) screening practice proposed by the IADPSG. Assumptions included that 1) women diagnosed with GDM received additional prenatal monitoring, mitigating the risks of preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia, and birth injury; and 2) GDM women had opportunity for intensive postdelivery counseling and behavior modification to reduce future diabetes risks. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Our model demonstrates that the IADPSG recommendations are cost-effective only when postdelivery care reduces diabetes incidence. For every 100,000 women screened, 6,178 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are gained, at a cost of $125,633,826. The ICER for the IADPSG strategy compared with the current standard was $20,336 per QALY gained. When postdelivery care was not accomplished, the IADPSG strategy was no longer cost-effective. These results were robust in sensitivity analyses. answer: The IADPSG recommendation for glucose screening in pregnancy is cost-effective. The model is most sensitive to the likelihood of preventing future diabetes in patients identified with GDM using postdelivery counseling and intervention.	yes
question: Does a 4 diagram manual enable laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme®? context: Bystander resuscitation plays an important role in lifesaving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A significant reduction in the "no-flow-time", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme® (LMAS) in the manikin. An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated. A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 ± 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25). answer: In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding.	yes
question: Is laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery feasible? context: Laparoscopic techniques can be used to treat patients whose antireflux surgery has failed. Case series. Two academic medical centers. Forty-six consecutive patients, of whom 21 were male and 25 were female (mean age, 55.6 years; range, 15-80 years). Previous antireflux procedures were laparoscopic (21 patients), laparotomy (21 patients), thoracotomy (3 patients), and thoracoscopy (1 patient). The cause of failure, operative and postoperative morbidity, and the level of follow-up satisfaction were determined for all patients. The causes of failure were hiatal herniation (31 patients [67%]), fundoplication breakdown (20 patients [43%]), fundoplication slippage (9 patients [20%]), tight fundoplication (5 patients [11%]), misdiagnosed achalasia (2 patients [4%]), and displaced Angelchik prosthesis (2 patients [4%]). Twenty-two patients (48%) had more than 1 cause. Laparoscopic reoperative procedures were Nissen fundoplication (n = 22), Toupet fundoplication (n = 13), paraesophageal hernia repair (n = 4), Dor procedure (n = 2), Angelchik prosthesis removal (n = 2), Heller myotomy (n = 2), and the takedown of a wrap (n = 1). In addition, 18 patients required crural repair and 13 required paraesophageal hernia repair. The mean +/- SEM duration of surgery was 3.5+/-1.1 hours. Operative complications were fundus tear (n = 8), significant bleeding (n = 4), bougie perforation (n = 1), small bowel enterotomy (n = 1), and tension pneumothorax (n = 1). The conversion rate (from laparoscopic to an open procedure) was 20% overall (9 patients) but 0% in the last 10 patients. Mortality was 0%. The mean +/- SEM hospital stay was 2.3+/-0.9 days for operations completed laparoscopically. Follow-up was possible in 35 patients (76%) at 17.2+/-11.8 months. The well-being score (1 best; 10, worst) was 8.6+/-2.1 before and 2.9+/-2.4 after surgery (P<.001). Thirty-one (89%) of 35 patients were satisfied with their decision to have reoperation. answer: Antireflux surgery failures are most commonly associated with hiatal herniation, followed by the breakdown of the fundoplication. The laparoscopic approach may be used successfully to treat patients with failed antireflux operations. Good results were achieved despite the technical difficulty of the procedures.	yes
question: The Omega-3 Index: a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease? context: Low intakes or blood levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA + DHA) are independently associated with increased risk of death from coronary heart disease (CHD). In randomized secondary prevention trials, fish or fish oil have been demonstrated to reduce total and CHD mortality at intakes of about 1 g/day. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid (FA) composition reflects long-term intake of EPA + DHA. We propose that the RBC EPA + DHA (hereafter called the Omega-3 Index) be considered a new risk factor for death from CHD. We conducted clinical and laboratory experiments to generate data necessary for the validation of the Omega-3 Index as a CHD risk predictor. The relationship between this putative marker and risk for CHD death, especially sudden cardiac death (SCD), was then evaluated in several published primary and secondary prevention studies. The Omega-3 Index was inversely associated with risk for CHD mortality. An Omega-3 Index of>or = 8% was associated with the greatest cardioprotection, whereas an index of<or = 4% was associated with the least. answer: The Omega-3 Index may represent a novel, physiologically relevant, easily modified, independent, and graded risk factor for death from CHD that could have significant clinical utility.	yes
question: Do cytokine concentrations in pancreatic juice predict the presence of pancreatic diseases? context: Cytokine concentration in pancreatic juice of patients with pancreatic disease is unknown. Secretin stimulation allows endoscopic collection of pancreatic juice secreted into the duodenum. We aimed to evaluate the cytokine concentrations in pancreatic juice of patients with abdominal pain to discriminate presence from absence of pancreatic disease. From January 2003-December 2004, consecutive patients with abdominal pain compatible with pancreatic origin were enrolled. Patients underwent upper endoscopy. Intravenous secretin (0.2 mug/kg) was given immediately before scope intubation. Pancreatic juice collected from the duodenum was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until assays were performed. Pancreatic juice levels of interleukin-8, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 were measured by modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The final diagnosis was made by the primary gastroenterologist on the basis of medical history; laboratory, endoscopic, and imaging studies; and clinical follow-up. Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used for statistical analysis. Of 130 patients screened, 118 met the inclusion criteria. Multivariate analysis revealed that only interleukin-8 was able to discriminate between normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis (P = .011), pancreatic cancer (P = .044), and the presence of pancreatic diseases (P = .007). Individual cytokine concentrations were not significantly different in chronic pancreatitis compared with pancreatic cancer. answer: Cytokine levels can be measured in pancreatic juice obtained from the duodenum without direct cannulation of the pancreatic duct. Interleukin-8 concentration in pancreatic juice can be used to discriminate between normal pancreas and patients with pancreatic disease. This is a relatively simple and noninvasive method to aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases.	yes
question: Factors determining the survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with lung metastasis alone: does combined modality treatment benefit? context: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with lung metastasis alone has been reported as a relatively favorable prognostic group, and combined modality treatment might be indicated for selected cases. However, the prognostic factors determining survival of this group and the indication of combined therapy have not been thoroughly studied. We retrospectively reviewed 246 patients of NPC with lung metastasis(es) alone presented at diagnosis or as the first failure after primary treatment from 1993 to 2008 in an academic tertiary hospital. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses of post-metastasis survival (PMS) and overall survival (OS) were carried out to determine the prognostic factors. The 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year of PMS and OS for the whole cohort were 34.3%, 17.0%, 8.6% and 67.8%, 45.4%, 18.5%, respectively. The median PMS (45.6 months vs. 23.7 months) and OS (73.7 months vs. 46.2 months) of patients treated with combined therapy was significantly longer than that of those treated with chemotherapy alone (P<0.001). Age, disease-free interval (DFI) and treatment modality were evaluated as independent prognostic factors of OS, while only age and treatment modality retain their independent significance in PMS analysis. In stratified survival analysis, compared to chemotherapy alone, combined therapy could benefit the patients with DFI>1 year, but not those with DFI ≤ 1 year. answer: Age ≤ 45 years, DFI>1 year, and the combined therapy were good prognostic factors for NPC patients with lung metastasis(es) alone. The combination of local therapy and the basic chemotherapy should be considered for these patients with DFI>1 year.	yes
question: Is minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords reproducible and applicable in routine surgery? context: Traditional resectional techniques and chordal transfer are difficult to apply in video-assisted mitral valve repair. Using artificial chords appears easier in this setting. The purpose of this study was to review the effectiveness and reproducibility of neochordal repair as a routine approach to minimally invasive mitral repair, and to assess the stability of neochord implantation using the figure-of-eight suture without pledgets in this setting. This is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent minimally invasive video-assisted mitral valve repair from 2008 to 2013. The primary endpoints were recurrent mitral regurgitation and reoperation. A total of 426 consecutive patients were included during the study period, with a mean age of 55 ± 18 years. Neochords were used in all patients, and in association with leaflet resection in 47 patients. One patient was not repairable and underwent valve replacement (repair rate, 99.8%). Fifteen patients had Grade I (3.5%) regurgitation, whereas the remainder had none. Patients were fast-tracked, with 25% extubated in the operation theatre and the remainder within 6 h. There were 5 deaths within 30 days (1.2%). Follow-up ranged 3-60 months, during which all of the patients remained with no or trace mitral regurgitation. No de-insertion or rupture of any neochords was found, and no patients required a reoperation. answer: Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.	yes
question: Does receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improve the management of pain at the end of life? context: To compare analgesic management of daily pain for dying nursing home residents enrolled and not enrolled in Medicare hospice. Retrospective, comparative cohort study. Over 800 nursing homes in Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New York, and South Dakota. A subset of residents with daily pain near the end of life taken from a matched cohort of hospice (2,644) and nonhospice (7,929) nursing home residents who had at least two resident assessments (Minimum Data Sets (MDSs)) completed, their last between 1992 and 1996, and who died before April 1997. The daily pain subset consisted of 709 hospice and 1,326 nonhospice residents. Detailed drug use data contained on the last MDS before death were used to examine analgesic management of daily pain. Guidelines from the American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) were used to identify analgesics not recommended for use in managing chronic pain in long-term care settings. The study outcome, regular treatment of daily pain, examined whether patients received any analgesic, other than those not recommended by AMDA, at least twice a day for each day of documented daily pain (i.e., 7 days before date of last MDS). Fifteen percent of hospice residents and 23% of nonhospice residents in daily pain received no analgesics (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.74). A lower proportion of hospice residents (21%) than of nonhospice residents (29%) received analgesics not recommended by AMDA (OR = 0.65, 95% CI =0.52-0.80). Overall, acetaminophen (not in combination with other drugs) was used most frequently for nonhospice residents (25% of 1,673 prescriptions), whereas morphine derivatives were used most frequently for hospice residents (30% of 1,058 prescriptions). Fifty-one percent of hospice residents and 33% of nonhospice residents received regular treatment for daily pain. Controlling for clinical confounders, hospice residents were twice as likely as nonhospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.68-2.56). answer: Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.	yes
question: Is intensive chemotherapy safe for rural cancer patients? context: To provide equality of cancer care to rural patients, Townsville Cancer Centre administers intensive chemotherapy regimens to rural patients with node-positive breast and metastatic colorectal cancers at the same doses as urban patients. Side-effects were usually managed by rural general practitioners locally.AIM: The aim is to determine the safety of this practice by comparing the profile of serious adverse events and dose intensities between urban and rural patients at the Townsville Cancer Centre. A retrospective audit was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal and node-positive breast cancers during a 24-month period. Fisher's exact test was used for analysis. Rurality was determined as per rural, remote and metropolitan classification. Of the 121 patients included, 70 and 51 patients had breast and colon cancers respectively. The urban versus rural patient split among all patients, breast and colorectal cancer subgroups was 68 versus 53, 43 versus 27 and 25 versus 26 respectively. A total of 421 cycles was given with dose intensity of>95% for breast cancer in both groups (P>0.05). Rate of febrile neutropenia was 9.3% versus 7.4% (P = 0.56). For XELOX, rate of diarrhoea was 20% versus 19% (P = 0.66) and rate of vomiting was 20% versus 11% (P = 0.11). Only two patients were transferred to Townsville for admission. No toxic death occurred in either group. answer: It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.	yes
question: Is the urinary biomarkers assessment a non-invasive approach to tubular lesions of the solitary kidney? context: The solitary kidney (SK) is currently debated in the literature, as living kidney donation is extensively used and the diagnosis of congenital SK is frequent. Tubulointerstitial lesions associated with adaptive phenomena may occur early within the SK. Analysis of the significance of urinary biomarkers in the assessment of tubulointerstitial lesions of the SK. A cross-sectional study of 37 patients with SK included 18 patients-acquired SK (mean age 56.44 ± 12.20 years, interval from nephrectomy 10.94 ± 9.37 years), 19 patients-congenital SK (mean age 41.52 ± 10.54 years). Urinary NAG, urinary alpha-1-microglobulin, albuminuria, eGFR (CKD-EPI equation) were measured. In acquired SK, NAG increased in 60.66%, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin in 16.66%, albuminuria in 55.55% of patients. Inverse correlation with eGFR presented NAG (R(2 )= 0.537, p = 0.022), urinary alpha 1-microglobulin (R(2 )= 0.702, p = 0.001), albuminuria (R(2 )= 0.655, p = 0.003). In congenital SK, NAG increased in 52.63%, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin in 5.26%, albuminuria in 47.36% of patients. In this group, urinary biomarkers correlated inversely with eGFR: NAG (R(2 )= 0.743, p < 0.001), urinary alpha 1-microglobulin (R(2 )= 0.701, p = 0.001), albuminuria (R(2 )= 0.821, p < 0.001). Significant correlations were found between the urinary biomarkers in both groups. answer: Urinary biomarkers allow a non-invasive, sensitive, early assessment of the tubular lesions of the SK. Urinary biomarkers of PT injury parallel renal function decline, thus complementing the estimation of GFR. Monitoring of PT dysfunction is mandatory in patients with SK.	yes
question: Does open access endoscopy close the door to an adequately informed patient? context: The use of open access endoscopy is increasing. Its effect on the adequacy of patient informed consent, procedure acceptance and the impact on subsequent communication/transfer of procedure results to the patient have not been evaluated. The aim of our study was to compare the extent of preknowledge of procedures and test explanation, patient medical complexity, information transfer and overall patient satisfaction between a patient group referred for outpatient open access endoscopy versus a patient group from a gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic. Information was obtained from all patients presenting for outpatient upper and lower endoscopy by using a 1-page questionnaire. Patients from the two groups who had an outpatient upper/lower endoscopic procedure were contacted by phone after the procedure to obtain information with a standardized questionnaire. The open access patients reported receiving significantly less information to help them identify the procedure (p<0.01) and less explanation concerning the nature of the procedure than the group of patients referred from the subspecialty clinic (p<0.005). There was no difference between the two groups in satisfaction scores for examinations performed under conscious sedation. For flexible sigmoidoscopy without sedation, however, the GI clinic patient group were more satisfied with their procedure. The majority of patients, regardless of access, were more likely to receive endoscopic results from a gastroenterologist than the referring physician. Furthermore, the patients in the GI clinic group who underwent colonoscopy felt significantly better at follow-up. answer: Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.	yes
question: Do viral infections have a role in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo? context: To investigate the role of viral infection in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In this retrospective study, 483 patients with BPPV were included in the study group. The control group consisted of 461 healthy subjects. In both groups, serologic analysis of viral agents (HSV1, HSV2, Herpes zoster, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus) was performed. With the exception of influenza and parainfluenza, all viral serology values were higher in the BBPV group than the control group. We also observed seasonal variation. The BPPV group exhibited elevated values for HSV1 and adenovirus in March and May, for Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and influenza in April, for HSV1 in June, and for HSV1 and CMV in September, compared to the control group. In October, the BPPV group showed increased values for all of the viruses studied, compared to the control group. answer: BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.	yes
question: Does reducing spasticity translate into functional benefit? context: Spasticity and loss of function in an affected arm are common after stroke. Although botulinum toxin is used to reduce spasticity, its functional benefits are less easily demonstrated. This paper reports an exploratory meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between reduced arm spasticity and improved arm function. Individual data from stroke patients in two randomised controlled trials of intra-muscular botulinum toxin were pooled. The Modified Ashworth Scale (elbow, wrist, fingers) was used to calculate a "Composite Spasticity Index". Data from the arm section of the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (dressing, grooming, and feeding) and three subjective measures (putting arm through sleeve, cleaning palm, cutting fingernails) were summed to give a "Composite Functional Index". Change scores and the time of maximum change were also calculated. Maximum changes in both composite measures occurred concurrently in 47 patients. In 26 patients the improvement in spasticity preceded the improvement in function with 18 showing the reverse. There was a definite relationship between the maximum change in spasticity and the maximum change in arm function, independent of treatment (rho = -0.2822, p = 0.0008, n = 137). There was a clear relationship between the changes in spasticity and in arm function in patients treated with botulinum toxin (Dysport) at 500 or 1000 units (rho = -0.5679, p = 0.0090, n = 22; rho = -0.4430, p = 0.0018, n = 47), but not in those treated with placebo or 1500 units. answer: Using a targeted meta-analytic approach, it is possible to demonstrate that reducing spasticity in the arm is associated with a significant improvement in arm function.	yes
question: Is the Retromandibular Transparotid Approach a Reliable Option for the Surgical Treatment of Condylar Fractures? context: This study evaluated the outcomes and complications of the surgical treatment of condylar fractures by the retromandibular transparotid approach. The authors hypothesized that such an approach would be safe and reliable for the treatment of most condylar fractures. A retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent surgical reduction of a condylar fracture from January 2012 to December 2014 at the Clinic of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University Hospital of Verona (Verona, Italy) was performed. Inclusion criteria were having undergone surgical treatment of condylar fractures with a retromandibular transparotid approach and the availability of computed tomograms of the preoperative and postoperative facial skeleton with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Static and dynamic occlusal function, temporomandibular joint health status, presence of neurologic impairments, and esthetic outcomes were evaluated in all patients. The sample was composed of 25 patients. Preinjury occlusion and temporomandibular joint health were restored in most patients. Esthetic outcomes were deemed satisfactory by clinicians and patients. Neither permanent neurologic impairments nor major postoperative complications were observed. answer: According to the results of the present study, the retromandibular transparotid approach is a viable and safe approach for the surgical treatment of condylar fractures.	yes
question: Do ventricular arrhythmias in athletes subside over time? context: Sudden death in athletes can occur during sport activities and is presumably related to ventricular arrhythmias. To investigate the long-term follow-up ofathletes with ventricular arrhythmias during an exercise test. From a database of 56,462 athletes we identified 192 athletes (35 years old who had ventricular arrhythmias during an exercise test. Ninety athletes had>or =3 ventricular premature beats (VPB) (group A) and 102 athletes had ventricular couplets or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during an exercise test (group B). A control group of 92 athletesfrom without ventricular arrhythmias was randomly seleclted from the database (group C). Of the 192 athletes 39 returnied for a repeat exercise test after a mean follow-up period of 70 +/- 25 months and they constitute the study population. Twelve athletes from group A, 21 fromgroup B and 6 from group C returned for a repeat exercise test. The athletes reached a significantly lower peak heart rate during their follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001). More athletes were engaged in competitive sports during their initialexercise test than in the follow-up test (P = 0.021). Most of theathletes who had VPB and/orventricular couplets and/or NSVT during their initial exercise test had far fewer ventricular arrhythmias in the follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001). answer: Athletes engaged in competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in non-competitive sports.	yes
question: Are complex coronary lesions more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus? context: Coronary atherosclerotic burden is excessive in diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent predictor for both death and myocardial infarction. It is not known whether the prevalence of complex coronary lesions, such as bifurcation and ostial lesions, is different in diabetics from nondiabetics. The aim of present study was to investigate the prevalence of these lesions in patients with DM. One thousand fourteen consecutive patients (mean age 61.3+/-10.7 years) were investigated. Coronary angiograms were examined for bifurcation and ostial lesions using a digital quantitative system. Patients were classified as diabetic (n=281) or nondiabetic (n=733). Patient mean age, and rates of hypertension and hyperlipidemia were significantly higher in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (P<0.0001), although smoking was significantly lower (P=0.001). Reasons for coronary angiography and treatment were comparable between the two groups. The prevalence of bifurcation lesions and ostial lesions was significantly greater in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (9.8% versus 4.3% [P=0.001] and 38.4% versus 29.2% [P=0.003]in the diabetic group versus the nondiabetic group). The presence of DM and greater age were found to be independent predictors for bifurcation lesions (OR=2.27 [P=0.004] and OR=1.03 [P=0.01], for DM and age, respectively) and ostial lesions (OR=1.40 [P=0.027] and OR=1.02 [P=0.001], for DM and age, respectively) in multivariate analysis. answer: Complex coronary lesions such as bifurcation and ostial lesions were significantly more common in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients. Greater age and the presence of DM were independent predictors for these complex lesions. These results may help to explain the poor prognosis of coronary artery disease among diabetic patients.	yes
question: Can dogs prime autistic children for therapy? context: Canine-assisted therapy has been receiving growing attention as a means of aiding children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, only limited studies have been done and a great deal of literature related to this intervention is anecdotal. The present study aims at providing additional quantitative evidence on the potential of dogs to positively modulate the behavior of children with ASD.SETTINGS/ A 12-year-old boy diagnosed with ASD was exposed, at his usual treatment location (the Portuguese Association for Developmental Disorders and Autism at Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal), to the following treatment conditions: (1) one-to-one structured activities with a therapist assisted by a certified therapy dog, and (2) one-to-one structured activities with the same therapist alone (as a control). To accurately assess differences in the behavior of the participant between these treatment conditions, the therapist followed a strict research protocol. The behavior of the participant was continuously video-recorded during both treatment conditions for further analysis and comparison. Treatment outcomes: In the presence of the dog, the participant exhibited more frequent and longer durations of positive behaviors (such as smiling and positive physical contacting) as well as less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors (such as aggressive manifestations). answer: These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.	yes
question: Quality of life in lung cancer patients: does socioeconomic status matter? context: As part of a prospective study on quality of life in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients an investigation was carried out to examine whether there were differences among patients' quality of life scores and their socioeconomic status. Quality of life was measured at two points in time (baseline and three months after initial treatment) using three standard instruments; the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the European Organization for Research and Cancer Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its lung cancer supplement (QLQ-LC13). Socioeconomic status for each individual patient was derived using Carstairs and Morris Deprivation Category ranging from 1 (least deprived) to 7 (most deprived) on the basis of the postcode sector of their address. In all, 129 lung cancer patients entered into the study. Of these data for 82 patients were complete (at baseline and follow-up). 57% of patients were of lower socioeconomic status and they had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms as compared to affluent patients. Of these, physical mobility (P = 0.05), energy (P = 0.01), role functioning (P = 0.04), physical functioning (P = 0.03), and breathlessness (P = 0.02) were significant at baseline. However, at follow-up assessment there was no significant difference between patient groups nor did any consistent pattern emerge. answer: At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.	yes
question: Is there a model to teach and practice retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy? context: Although the retroperitoneal approach has been the preferred choice for open urological procedures, retroperitoneoscopy is not the preferred approach for laparoscopy. This study aims to develop a training model for retroperitoneoscopy and to establish an experimental learning curve. Fifteen piglets were operated on to develop a standard retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy (RPN) training model. All procedures were performed with three ports. Intraoperative data (side, operative time, blood loss, peritoneal opening) were recorded. Animals were divided into groups A, the first eight, and B, the last seven cases. Data were statistically analyzed. We performed fifteen RPNs. The operative time varied from 15 to 50 minutes (median 30 minutes). Blood loss varied from 5 to 100 mL (median 20 mL). We experienced five peritoneal openings; we had two surgical vascular complications managed laparoscopically. There was statistical difference between groups A and B for peritoneal opening (p = 0.025), operative time (p = 0.0037), and blood loss (p = 0.026). RPN in a porcine model could simulate the whole procedure, from creating the space to nephrectomy completion. Experimental learning curve was eight cases, after statistical data analysis. answer: RPN in a porcine model is feasible and could be very useful for teaching and practicing retroperitoneoscopy.	yes
question: Is the type of remission after a major depressive episode an important risk factor to relapses in a 4-year follow up? context: Rates of relapse and predictive relapse factors were studied over more than 4 years in a sample of Spanish outpatients with DSM-III-R criteria for unipolar major depressive episode. A final sample of 139 outpatient was followed monthly in a naturalistic study. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R was used. Phases of evolution were recorded using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, applying the Frank criteria. Survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier product limit and proportional hazards models were used. A higher rate of relapses was observed in the partial remission group (91.4%) compared to the complete remission one (51.3%). The four factors with predictive relapse value were: "partial remission versus complete remission", "the intensity of clinical symptoms", "the age" and "the number of previous depressive episodes". The existence of partial remission was the most powerful predictive factor. The decreasing sample size during the follow-up and the difficulty in warranting the treatment compliance. answer: At medium term, relapse rates for a major depressive episode are high. Partial remission after a depressive episode seems to be an important predictive factor for relapses in a 4-year follow-up.	yes
question: Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor: is the standard of effective analgesia reachable in all women? context: Social and cultural factors combined with little information may prevent the diffusion of epidural analgesia for pain relief during childbirth. The present study was launched contemporarily to the implementation of analgesia for labor in our Department in order to perform a 2 years audit on its use. The goal is to evaluate the epidural acceptance and penetration into hospital practice by women and care givers and safety and efficacy during childbirth. This audit cycle measured epidural analgesia performance against 4 standards: (1) Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor to all patients; (2) Acceptance and good satisfaction level reported by patients and caregivers. (3) Effectiveness of labor analgesia; (4) No maternal or fetal side effects. During the audit period epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% of all labors in the first trimester of the study to 51% in the last trimester (p<0.005). Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) time course: in 226 patients (cluster 1) VAS decreased from 8.5±1.4 before to 4.1±1.3 after epidural analgesia; in 1002 patients (cluster 2) VAS decreased from 8.12±1.7 before (NS vs cluster 1), to 0.76±0.79 after (p<0.001 vs before and vs cluster 2 after). No other differences between clusters were observed. answer: Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.	yes
question: Longer term quality of life and outcome in stroke patients: is the Barthel index alone an adequate measure of outcome? context: To consider whether the Barthel Index alone provides sufficient information about the long term outcome of stroke. Cross sectional follow up study with a structured interview questionnaire and measures of impairment, disability, handicap, and general health. The scales used were the hospital anxiety and depression scale, mini mental state examination, Barthel index, modified Rankin scale, London handicap scale, Frenchay activities index, SF36, Nottingham health profile, life satisfaction index, and the caregiver strain index. South east London. People, and their identified carers, resident in south east London in 1989-90 when they had their first in a life-time stroke aged under 75 years. Observational study. Comparison and correlation of the individual Barthel index scores with the scores on other outcome measures. One hundred and twenty three (42%) people were known to be alive, of whom 106 (86%) were interviewed. The median age was 71 years (range 34-79). The mean interval between the stroke and follow up was 4.9 years. The rank correlation coefficients between the Barthel and the different dimensions of the SF36 ranged from r = 0.217 (with the role emotional dimension) to r = 0.810 (with the physical functioning dimension); with the Nottingham health profile the range was r = -0.189 (with the sleep dimension, NS) to r = -0.840 (with the physical mobility dimension); with the hospital and anxiety scale depression component the coefficient was r = -0.563, with the life satisfaction index r = 0.361, with the London handicap scale r = 0.726 and with the Frenchay activities index r = 0.826. answer: The place of the Barthel index as the standard outcome measure for populations of stroke patients is still justified for long term follow up, and may be a proxy for different outcome measures intended for the assessment of other domains.	yes
question: Does a special interest in laparoscopy affect the treatment of acute cholecystitis? context: We tested the hypothesis that the treatment of patients with acute cholecystitis (AC) would be improved under the care of laparoscopic specialists. The records of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for AC from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1998 were reviewed retrospectively. Of 170 patients, 48 were cared for by three laparoscopic specialists (LS group), whereas 122 were treated by nine general surgeons who perform only laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) (GS group). The rates of successful LC, complications, and length of hospital stay were compared. Multivariate analysis was used to control for baseline differences. The patients in the GS group were older (median age, 63 vs 53 years; p = 0.01). In all, 31 LS patients (65%), as compared with 44 GS patients (36%), had successful laparoscopic treatment (p = 0.001). The operating time was the same (median, 70 min). The proportion of patients with postoperative complications was similar in the two groups (37% in the GS vs 31% in the LS group; p = 0.6). The median postoperative hospital stay (3 vs 5 days; p<0.01) was shorter in the LS group. On logistic regression analysis, significant predictors of a successful laparoscopic operation included LS group (p<0.01) and age (p = 0). Predictors of prolonged length of hospital stay were age (p<0.01) and comorbidity score (p<0.01), with LS group status not a significant factor (p = 0.21). answer: Patients with AC are more likely to undergo successful LC if cared for by a surgeon with an interest in laparoscopy. However, length of hospital stay is influenced more by patient factors in a multivariate model.	yes
question: Do older adults with cancer fall more often? context: To examine whether a history of cancer increased the likelihood of a fall in community-dwelling older adults, and if cancer type, stage, or time since diagnosis increased falls. A longitudinal, retrospective, cohort study. A home- and community-based waiver program in Michigan. 862 older adults aged 65 years or older with cancer compared to 8,617 older adults without cancer using data from the Minimum Data Set-Home Care and Michigan cancer registry. Reports of falls were examined for 90-180 days. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare differences between the groups. Cancer, falls, patient characteristics, comorbidities, medications, pain, weight loss, vision, memory recall, and activities, as well as cancer type, stage, and time since diagnosis. A fall occurred at a rate of 33% in older adults with cancer compared to 29% without cancer (p<0.00). Those with a history of cancer were more likely to fall than those without cancer (adjusted odds ratio 1.16; 95% confidence interval [1.02, 1.33]; p = 0.03). No differences in fall rates were determined by cancer type or stage, and the odds of a fall did not increase when adding time since cancer diagnosis. answer: The fall rate was higher in older adults with cancer than in older adults without cancer.	yes
question: Two-year follow-up survey of patients with allergic contact dermatitis from an occupational cohort: is the prognosis dependent on the omnipresence of the allergen? context: Skin diseases are the most frequently recognized occupational diseases in Denmark. The prognosis for occupational contact dermatitis is often poor. To investigate the prognosis, assessed by eczema, job status and skin-related quality of life, among patients allergic to rubber chemicals and latex (ubiquitous allergens) and epoxy (nonubiquitous allergen), 2 years after recognition of occupational allergic contact dermatitis. From a cohort of all patients recognized as having occupational dermatitis by the Danish National Board of Industrial Injuries in 2010, 199 patients with relevant rubber allergy (contact allergy to rubber chemicals or contact urticaria from latex) or epoxy allergy were identified. Follow-up consisted of a questionnaire covering current severity of eczema, employment, exposure and quality of life. The response rate was 75%. Clearance of eczema was reported by 11% of patients and 67% reported improvement. Overall 22% of patients with allergy to a nonubiquitous allergen had total clearance of eczema compared with 10% of cases allergic to ubiquitous allergens and 0% of those with contact urticaria (P = 0·116). Improvement was significantly more frequent in those who had changed jobs compared with those who had not (P = 0·01). answer: At follow-up, patients with contact urticaria had significantly poorer prognosis than those with contact allergy, and there was a trend towards a poorer prognosis for those with contact allergy to rubber chemicals than those with allergy to epoxy. A significant positive association between job change and improvement was found.	yes
question: Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases? context: To analyze, retrospectively, the patterns and behavior of metastatic lesions in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and to investigate whether patients with<or =5 lesions had an improved outcome relative to patients with>5 lesions. The treatment and outcome of 369 eligible patients with Stage T1-T3aN0-NXM0 prostate cancer were analyzed during a minimal 10-year follow-up period. All patients were treated with curative intent to a mean dose of 65 Gy. The full history of any metastatic disease was documented for each subject, including the initial site of involvement, any progression over time, and patient survival. The overall survival rate for the 369 patients was 75% at 5 years and 45% at 10 years. The overall survival rate of patients who never developed metastases was 90% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. However, among the 74 patients (20%) who developed metastases, the survival rate at both 5 and 10 years was significantly reduced (p<0.0001). The overall survival rate for patients who developed bone metastases was 58% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and patients with bone metastases to the pelvis fared worse compared with those with vertebral metastases. With regard to the metastatic number, patients with<or =5 metastatic lesions had superior survival rates relative to those with>5 lesions (73% and 36% at 5 and 10 years vs. 45% and 18% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.02). In addition, both the metastasis-free survival rate and the interval measured from the date of the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to the development of bone metastasis were statistically superior for patients with<or =5 lesions compared with patients with>5 lesions (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). However, the survival rate and the interval from the date of diagnosis of bone metastasis to the time of death for patients in both groups were not significantly different, statistically (p = 0.17 and 0.27, respectively). answer: Patients with<or =5 metastatic sites had significantly better survival rates than patients with>5 lesions. Because existing sites of metastatic disease may be the primary sites of origin for additional metastases, our findings suggest that early detection and aggressive treatment of patients with a small number of metastatic lesions is worth testing as an approach to improving long-term survival.	yes
question: Does radiotherapy around the time of pregnancy for Hodgkin's disease modify the risk of breast cancer? context: To determine whether the risk of secondary breast cancer after radiotherapy (RT) for Hodgkin's disease is greater among women who underwent RT around time of pregnancy. The records of 382 women treated with RT for Hodgkin's disease were reviewed and divided into those who received RT around the time of pregnancy and those who were not pregnant. Comparisons of the overall incidence, actuarial rates, and latency to breast cancer between the two groups were made. Multivariate Cox regression modeling was performed to determine possible contributing factors. Of the 382 women, 14 developed breast cancer (3.7%). The increase in the overall incidence (16.0% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.0001) and the actuarial rate of breast cancer among the women in the pregnant group (p = 0.011) was statistically significant. The women treated around the time of pregnancy had a 10- and 15-year actuarial rate of breast cancer of 6.7% and 32.6%, respectively. The 10-year and 15-year actuarial rate for the nonpregnant women was 0.4% and 1.7%, respectively. The median latency from RT to the diagnosis of breast cancer was 13.1 and 18.9 years for women in the pregnant and nonpregnant groups, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, pregnancy around the time of RT was the only variable associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The risk was dependent on the length of time from pregnancy to RT, with women receiving RT during pregnancy and within 1 month of pregnancy having an increased risk of breast cancer compared with nonpregnant women and women irradiated later than 1 month after pregnancy (hazard ratio, 22.49; 95% confidence interval, 5.56-90.88; p<0.001). answer: The results of this study indicate that the risk of breast cancer after RT is greater with irradiation around the time of pregnancy. This suggests that pregnancy is a time of increased sensitivity of breast tissue to the carcinogenic effects of radiation. Because of the small sample size and limited follow-up, additional studies are recommended to confirm these findings.	yes
question: Does left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion device alter the echocardiography and electrocardiogram parameters in patients with atrial fibrillation? context: The alterations of echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients received left atrial appendage LAA occlusion therapy are still unclear. The present study was to evaluate the influence of LAA occlusion device on echocardiography and ECG changes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Seventy-three patients who had undergone Watchman, LAmbre and Lefort were enrolled in this study. Echocardiography and ECG results at pre- and post-operation were collected. Besides, echocardiography was also performed during follow-up visits at 1, 6 and 12months after discharge. After LAA occlusion, a slight and measureable movement of QRS electric axis was observed in most patients. The significant differences were also observed in heart rate (HR) and the mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation for all patients. There existed no significant difference in echocardiographic parameters between before and after device implantation. However, a larger left atrial (LA) diameter was detected by echocardiography during follow-up visit at 6months when compared with pre-operation parameters. Similarly, aortic root diameter (ARD) was also larger during follow-up at 12months than the baseline dimension in pre-operation. answer: LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.	yes
question: Is non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography? context: Esophageal varices are present in 30% to 40% of patients in compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) and in 60% to 85% of patients in decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classes B and C). It is important to identify patients with compensated cirrhosis at risk for esophageal varix development. We evaluated the accuracy of a duplex Doppler ultrasonographic index for predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) by using endoscopy as the reference standard. Fifty-six enrolled patients underwent duplex Doppler ultrasonography followed by screening endoscopy. Mean portal vein velocity (PVV), splenic index (SI), splenoportal index (SPI), hepatic and splenic arterial resistive, and pulsatility indices (hepatic artery resistive index [HARI], hepatic artery pulsatility index [HAPI], splenic artery resistive index [SARI], splenic artery pulsatility index [SAPI]) were recorded. Univariate logistic regression analysis was followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve construction for the indices that were significant. The indices HARI, HAPI, SARI, SAPI were not helpful (p > 0.05). Mean PVV, SI, and SPI were all predictive of the presence of esophageal varices (p < 0.05) and SPI was found to be the most accurate parameter. Of the various cut-off levels of SPI evaluated, a cut-off value of SPI at 5.0, offered the highest diagnostic accuracy (88%). For the 28 patients with SPI<5.0, the absence of esophageal varices in 27 of them could be correctly diagnosed using only SPI without invasive screening endoscopy, with high negative predictive value (96%) and sensitivity (96%). Of the remaining 28 patients with SPI ≥5.0, presence of esophageal varices could be similarly correctly diagnosed in 22 of them by using SPI without screening endoscopy, with high positive predictive value (79%) and specificity (82%). answer: The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.	yes
question: Do inhaled steroids differ from cromones in terms of hospital admission rates for asthma in children? context: Annual data on children aged under 16 y treated for asthma, including consumption of regular medication for asthma, numbers of hospital periods, lengths of hospitalizations and annual proportions of readmissions, were collected using patient-specific medical records from 1995 to 1999. In the Kuopio province, on average, 35.6-36.7/1000 children were on maintenance for asthma, of which 23% were receiving cromones, 51% were taking inhaled steroids and 26% were treated with cromones plus intermittent steroids. In the Oulu province, the respective prevalence was 32.7-34.9/1000, and the respective proportions were 5%, 93% and 2%. Total and first admissions, as well as hospital days were clearly less in the Oulu province. In the children aged>or = 6y, the average annual total admissions were 0.3/1000 (Oulu) vs 1.2/1000 (Kuopio) (p<0.001). Similarly, the first admissions were 0.2/1000 vs 1.0/1000 (p<0.001), proportions of readmissions 6.3% vs 19.3% (p<0.05), and numbers of hospital days 0.7/1000 vs 3.8/1000 (p<0.001). The differences were in the same direction, though less prominent, also among children 2-5 y of age. answer: Our results suggest that inhaled steroids are better than cromones in preventing admissions for asthma when two provinces with different practices for maintenance medication of steady-state asthma were compared.	yes
question: Does airway surgery lower serum lipid levels in obstructive sleep apnea patients? context: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is tightly linked to increased cardiovascular disease. Surgery is an important method to treat OSA, but its effect on serum lipid levels in OSA patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effect of upper airway surgery on lipid profiles. We performed a retrospective review of 113 adult patients with OSA who underwent surgery (nasal or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP]) at a major, urban, academic hospital in Beijing from 2012 to 2013 who had preoperative and postoperative serum lipid profiles. Serum TC (4.86±0.74 to 4.69±0.71) and LP(a) (median 18.50 to 10.90) all decreased significantly post-operatively (P<0.01, 0.01, respectively), with no changes in serum HDL, LDL, or TG (P>0.05, all). For UPPP patients (n=51), serum TC, HDL and LP(a) improved (P=0.01, 0.01,<0.01, respectively). For nasal patients (n=62), only the serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In patients with normal serum lipids at baseline, only serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In contrast, in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, the serum HDL, TG and LP(a) showed significant improvements (P=0.02, 0.03,<0.01, respectively). In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, the serum LP(a) decreased significantly (P=0.01), with a similar trend for serum TC (P=0.06). In patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, the serum TC and LDL also decreased (P=0.02, 0.03, respectively). answer: Surgery may improve blood lipid levels in patients with OSA, especially in patients with preoperative dyslipidemia, potentially yielding a major benefit in metabolism and cardiovascular sequelae. Prospective studies should examine this potential metabolic effect of airway surgery for OSA.	yes
question: Israeli hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents: can the surge capacity and injury severity distribution be better predicted? context: The incidence of large-scale urban attacks on civilian populations has significantly increased across the globe over the past decade. These incidents often result in Hospital Multiple Casualty Incidents (HMCI), which are very challenging to hospital teams. 15 years ago the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health defined a key of 20 percent of each hospital's bed capacity as its readiness for multiple casualties. Half of those casualties are expected to require immediate medical treatment. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs. A retrospective study of HMCIs was recorded in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) home front command and the Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) between November 2000 and June 2003. An HMCI is defined by the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health as>or=10 casualties or>or=4 suffering from injuries with an ISS>or=16 arriving to a single hospital. The study includes a total of 32 attacks, resulting in 62 HMCIs and 1292 casualties. The mean number of arriving casualties to a single hospital was 20.8+/-13.3 (range 4-56, median 16.5). In 95% of the HMCIs the casualty load was<or=52. Based on severity scores and ED discharges 1022 (79.2%) casualties did not necessitate immediate medical treatment. answer: Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.	yes
question: Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up? context: To investigate whether problems in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can add to conventionally used clinical measurements in helping to predict a diagnosis of dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Multicenter prospective cohort study. Memory clinics in Europe. Individuals aged 55 and older without dementia. IADLs were measured using pooled activities from five informant-based questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relation between IADLs and dementia. Age, sex, education, depression, and cognitive measures (Mini-Mental State Examination and verbal memory) were included in the model. Five hundred thirty-one participants had baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments; 69 (13.0%) of these had developed dementia at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-up, 481 participants were seen, of whom 100 (20.8%) had developed dementia. Participants with IADL disabilities at baseline had a higher conversion rate (24.4%) than participants without IADL disabilities (16.7%) (chi-square = 4.28, degrees of freedom = 1, P = .04). SEM showed that IADL disability could help predict dementia in addition to the measured variables at 1-year follow-up (odds ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.51-3.13) and 2-year follow-up (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.33-3.33). answer: IADL disability is a useful addition to the diagnostic process in a memory clinic setting, indicating who is at higher risk of developing dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.	yes
question: Is pelvic pain associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse? context: To investigate the significance of pelvic pain and its association with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). This is a cross sectional study of 248 women with stage II POP or greater. Women were stratified into "pain" and "no-pain" groups based on their response to a question on the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory short form. Associations between patient demographics, exam findings and responses to validated questionnaires were evaluated. In women with POP, defecatory symptoms are significantly more common in women with pelvic pain including straining with bowel movement (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3, 4.6), sense of incomplete emptying (OR 4.4, 95% CI 2.3, 8.2), pain with bowel movement (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.2, 23.0) and splinting with bowel movement (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.0, 7.5). answer: In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.	yes
question: Does the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension identify cognitive impairments? context: To investigate the relevance of the Symptom Checklist 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale to cognition in individuals with brain tumor. A prospective study of patients assessed with a neuropsychological test battery. A university medical center. Nineteen adults with biopsy-confirmed diagnoses of malignant brain tumors were assessed prior to aggressive chemotherapy. Included in the assessment were the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, California Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test B, Symptom Checklist 90-R, Mood Assessment Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Chronic Illness Problem Inventory. The SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale was not related to objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or age. It was related significantly to symptoms of depression (r = .81, P<.005), anxiety (r = .66, P<.005), and subjective complaints of memory problems (r = .75, P<.005). Multivariate analyses indicated that reported symptoms of depression contributed 66% of the variance in predicting SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive Scores, whereas symptoms of anxiety contributed an additional 6% (P<.0001). answer: Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.	yes
question: Is non-HDL-cholesterol a better predictor of long-term outcome in patients after acute myocardial infarction compared to LDL-cholesterol? context: It has recently been shown that non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) may be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Based on known ethic differences in lipid parameters and cardiovascular risk prediction, we sought to study the predictability of attaining non-HDL-C target and long-term major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in Thai patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) compared to attaining LDL-C target. We retrospectively obtained the data of all patients who were admitted at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital due to AMI during 2006-2013. The mean non-HDL-C and LDL-C during long-term follow-up were used to predict MACE at each time point. The patients were classified as target attainment if non-HDL-C <100 mg/dl and/or LDL-C <70 mg/dl. The MACE was defined as combination of all-cause death, nonfatal coronary event and nonfatal stroke. During mean follow-up of 2.6 ± 1.6 years among 868 patients after AMI, 34.4% achieved non-HDL-C target, 23.7% achieved LDL-C target and 21.2% experienced MACEs. LDL-C and non-HDL-C were directly compared in Cox regression model. Compared with non-HDL-C <100 mg/dl, patients with non-HDL-C of>130 mg/dl had higher incidence of MACEs (HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.46-6.80, P = 0.003). Surprisingly, LDL-C >100 mg/dl was associated with reduced risk of MACE as compared to LDL <70 mg/dl (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.98, p = 0.046) after direct pairwise comparison with non-HDL-C level. answer: Non-attaining non-HDL-C goal predicted MACE at long-term follow-up after AMI whereas non-attaining LDL-C goal was not associated with the higher risk. Therefore, non-HDL-C may be a more suitable target of dyslipidemia treatment than LDL-C in patients after AMI.	yes
question: Body diffusion-weighted MR imaging of uterine endometrial cancer: is it helpful in the detection of cancer in nonenhanced MR imaging? context: In this study, the authors discussed the feasibility and value of diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging in the detection of uterine endometrial cancer in addition to conventional nonenhanced MR images. DW images of endometrial cancer in 23 patients were examined by using a 1.5-T MR scanner. This study investigated whether or not DW images offer additional incremental value to conventional nonenhanced MR imaging in comparison with histopathological results. Moreover, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured in the regions of interest within the endometrial cancer and compared with those of normal endometrium and myometrium in 31 volunteers, leiomyoma in 14 patients and adenomyosis in 10 patients. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used, with a p<0.05 considered statistically significant. In 19 of 23 patients, endometrial cancers were detected only on T2-weighted images. In the remaining 4 patients, of whom two had coexisting leiomyoma, no cancer was detected on T2-weighted images. This corresponds to an 83% detection sensitivity for the carcinomas. When DW images and fused DW images/T2-weighted images were used in addition to the T2-weighted images, cancers were identified in 3 of the remaining 4 patients in addition to the 19 patients (overall detection sensitivity of 96%). The mean ADC value of endometrial cancer (n=22) was (0.97+/-0.19)x10(-3)mm(2)/s, which was significantly lower than those of the normal endometrium, myometrium, leiomyoma and adenomyosis (p<0.05). answer: DW imaging can be helpful in the detection of uterine endometrial cancer in nonenhanced MR imaging.	yes
question: Does pediatric housestaff experience influence tests ordered for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit? context: To assess the relationship between the experience of pediatric housestaff and tests ordered on infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU). Prospective, cohort study over one full academic year. One academic Level III neonatal intensive care nursery. Data were collected prospectively on all 785 infants admitted to the neonatal ICU from July 1993 to June 1994. These infants were cared for by 14 different categorical pediatric housestaff. Our neonatal ICU has either a resident or an intern on-call by himself/herself at night, affording us a natural setting to compare intern vs. resident test ordering. The outcomes of interest were number of arterial blood gases, radiographs, and electrolytes ordered per infant by the on-call pediatric houseofficer, as tabulated the morning after the call night. Control variables included the severity-of-illness of the individual infant (using the Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System), the workload of the houseofficer (number of patients, number of admissions), and supervision (rounding frequency and on-call attending). Controlling for the severity-of-illness of the infant, the workload on the call night, and supervision with multiple linear regression, we found that interns ordered significantly (p = .02) greater numbers of arterial blood gases per infant than residents, amounting to some 0.33 blood gases per infant per call night (3.22 vs. 2.89 arterial blood gases per infant per night). This increase of 0.33 blood gases per infant amounts to interns ordering $169 more arterial blood gases per call night at our institution. There was no difference between interns and residents in ordering radiographs or electrolytes. answer: Interns order significantly more arterial blood gases per infant than junior and senior residents on-call in the neonatal ICU. Additional study is required to see if the experience of housestaff is associated with a broader array of neonatal outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality.	yes
question: Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring? context: Accurate and updated information on airborne pollen in specific areas can help allergic patients. Current monitoring systems are based on a morphologic identification approach, a time-consuming method that may represent a limiting factor for sampling network enhancement. To verify the feasibility of developing a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach, an alternative to optical analysis, as a rapid, accurate, and automated tool for the detection and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen taxa. The traditional cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-based method was modified for DNA isolation from pollen. Taxon-specific DNA sequences were identified via bioinformatics or literature searches and were PCR amplified from the matching allergenic taxa; based on the sequences of PCR products, complementary or degenerate TaqMan probes were developed. The accuracy of the quantitative real-time PCR assay was tested on 3 plant species. The setup of a modified DNA extraction protocol allowed us to achieve good-quality pollen DNA. Taxon-specific nuclear gene fragments were identified and sequenced. Designed primer pairs and probes identified selected pollen taxa, mostly at the required classification level. Pollen was properly identified even when collected on routine aerobiological tape. Preliminary quantification assays on pollen grains were successfully performed on test species and in mixes. answer: The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.	yes
question: Is the 7th TNM edition suitable for biological predictor in early gastric cancer? context: The clinical and prognostic value of the previous node classification of TNM staging in early gastric cancer (EGC) has been less definitive. The aim was to assess the suitability of the revised node staging for prediction of clinical behavior of EGC. Between 2005 and 2008, 1,845 patients were diagnosed with EGC and underwent surgery at Severance Hospitals. Clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed with comparisons between sixth and seventh TNM staging. When comparing IB with IIA upstaged based on seventh staging, poor differentiation, signet ring cell, diffuse, undifferentiated types, perineural invasion (PNI), larger size and younger age, were more significantly associated with IIA. Clinicopathological factors were compared between N0/N1 and N2/N3 based on both staging. In mucosal cancer, younger age, diffuse and undifferentiated types were more significantly associated with N2/N3 based on seventh staging. In submucosal cancer, larger size, poor differentiation, signet ring cell, diffuse, undifferentiated types, PNI and deeper submucosal invasion, were more significantly associated with N2/N3 based on seventh staging. answer: Upstaging in EGC based on the revised TNM staging reflects more aggressive biological behavior of cancer. The new TNM staging system may be informative in prediction of biological behavior of EGC as well as prognosis and survival.	yes
question: Are lower fasting plasma glucose levels at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes associated with improved outcomes? context: Type 2 diabetes may be present for several years before diagnosis, by which time many patients have already developed diabetic complications. Earlier detection and treatment may reduce this burden, but evidence to support this approach is lacking. Glycemic control and clinical and surrogate outcomes were compared for 5,088 of 5,102 U.K. Diabetes Prospective Study participants according to whether they had low (<140 mg/dl [<7.8 mmol/l]), intermediate (140 to<180 mg/dl [7.8 to<10.0 mmol/l]), or high (>or =180 mg/dl [>or =10 mmol/l]) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels at diagnosis. Individuals who presented with and without diabetic symptoms were also compared. Fewer people with FPG in the lowest category had retinopathy, abnormal biothesiometer measurements, or reported erectile dysfunction. The rate of increase in FPG and HbA(1c) during the study was identical in all three groups, although absolute differences persisted. Individuals in the low FPG group had a significantly reduced risk for each predefined clinical outcome except stroke, whereas those in the intermediate group had significantly reduced risk for each outcome except stroke and myocardial infarction. The low and intermediate FPG groups had a significantly reduced risk for progression of retinopathy, reduction in vibration sensory threshold, or development of microalbuminuria. answer: People presenting with type 2 diabetes with lower initial glycemia who may be earlier in the course of their disease had fewer adverse clinical outcomes despite similar glycemic progression. Since most such people are asymptomatic at diagnosis, active case detection programs would be required to identify them.	yes
question: Remote ischemic postconditioning: does it protect against ischemic damage in percutaneous coronary revascularization? context: Myocardial damage that is associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) partially affects the results of the procedure, and is related to medium-term cardiovascular death. Remote postischemic conditioning might reduce the myocardial lesions that are associated with PCI, but perhaps less so in diabetics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of remote postischemic conditioning in patients undergoing elective PCI for stable angina or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome with troponin<1 ng/ml at the time of randomization. This randomized single-blinded single-center clinical trial involved 320 patients undergoing elective PCI who were randomized to either receive three 5-min cycles of ischemia by inflation of a cuff on the non-dominant arm to 200 mm Hg (remote postischemic conditioning) or to placebo (uninflated cuff). The primary outcome variable was the maximum increase in troponin in the first 24 h. The secondary outcome variable was readmission due to heart failure or cardiovascular mortality after 1 year of follow-up. In addition, a diabetic population was studied. answer: This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.	yes
question: Does multi-modal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus? context: Tinnitus can be related to many different aetiologies such as hearing loss or a noise trauma, but it can also be related to the somatosensory system of the cervical spine, called cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). Case studies suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available. To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. Randomized controlled trial. Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI): 25-90 points) and neck complaints (Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ) > 14 points). All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n = 19) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n = 19). TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline. In all patients (n = 38) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p = 0.04 and p < 0.001). NBQ-scores remained significantly lower after follow-up (p = 0.001). Immediately after treatment, 53% (n = 38) experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus. This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks. answer: Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.	yes
question: Processing fluency effects: can the content and presentation of participant information sheets influence recruitment and participation for an antenatal intervention? context: To assess the extent to which the title and font of participant information sheets (PISs) can influence pregnant women's and trainee midwives' perceptions of an antenatal intervention. Pregnant women (n=35) and trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; Awkward Title-Fluent Font). After reading the PIS, participants rated their perceptions of the intervention (i.e., Attractiveness, Complexity, Expected Risk, Required Effort) using five-point Likert scales. A 4×2 factorial multivariate analysis of variance revealed that pregnant women rated the Double Awkward condition as significantly more complex than the Double Fluent (p=.024) and Awkward Title-Fluent Font (p=.021) conditions. answer: Font influenced pregnant women's ratings of intervention complexity.	yes
question: Fulfilling human resources development goal in West Africa: can the training of ophthalmologist diplomates be improved? context: To ascertain the perspectives of Trainee Ophthalmologist Diplomats (TOD) on the Ophthalmic Diploma Training (ODT) in West Africa with a view to improving the programme. A survey of set 2005 TOD on ODT was carried out in Ghana, 2006. The trainees included 10 (83.35%) males and two (16.7%) females whose ages ranged between thirty-two and fifty-one years. The sponsors of the trainees included Sight Savers International, five (41.7%); Christian Blind Mission International, three (25.0%); Eye Foundation, Lagos, Nigeria two (16.7%); Ministry of Defence Nigeria, one (8.3%); and Health Authority Ghana, one (8.3%). Nine trainees (75.0%) felt the programme was well structured, training allowances were adequate eight (66.7%) and inadequate four (33.3%). Eleven (91.7%) trainees would work wherever they were posted; ten (83.3%) trainees had sense of fulfillment and three (25%) would like to proceed for residency training. All trainees were at least good in chalazion surgery and treatment of common medical eye conditions. Majority were at least good in eye surgery like cataract, eleven (91.7%); trabeculectomy nine (75.0%); pterygium 10 (83.3%); eyelid, eight (66.7%); destructive 11 (91.6%) and refraction 9 (75.0%). Some trainees' perceived problems included inadequate sponsorship (33.3%), short duration of the course four (33.3%) and poor accommodation facility two (16.7%). However, trainees' suggested increase in training posts, four (33.3); training allowance three (25.0%); and incentives for trainers/training hospitals two (16.7%). answer: The ODT programme ensures ophthalmic manpower for secondary eye care level despite challenges. The stakeholders should look into problems facing the programme in order to improve it.	yes
question: Predicting admission at triage: are nurses better than a simple objective score? context: In this single-centre prospective study, triage nurses estimated the probability of admission using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), and GAPS was generated automatically from triage data. We compared calibration using rank sum tests, discrimination using area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and accuracy with McNemar's test. Of 1829 attendances, 745 (40.7%) were admitted, not significantly different from GAPS' prediction of 750 (41.0%, p=0.678). In contrast, the nurses' mean VAS predicted 865 admissions (47.3%), overestimating by 6.6% (p<0.0001). GAPS discriminated between admission and discharge as well as nurses, its AUC 0.876 compared with 0.875 for VAS (p=0.93). As a binary predictor, its accuracy was 80.6%, again comparable with VAS (79.0%), p=0.18. In the minority of attendances, when nurses felt at least 95% certain of the outcome, VAS' accuracy was excellent, at 92.4%. However, in the remaining majority, GAPS significantly outperformed VAS on calibration (+1.2% vs +9.2%, p<0.0001), discrimination (AUC 0.810 vs 0.759, p=0.001) and accuracy (75.1% vs 68.9%, p=0.0009). When we used GAPS, but 'over-ruled' it when clinical certainty was ≥95%, this significantly outperformed either method, with AUC 0.891 (0.877-0.907) and accuracy 82.5% (80.7%-84.2%). answer: GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.	yes
question: Are adult body circumferences associated with height? context: Weight scales as height squared, which is an observation that forms the basis of body mass index (weight/height(2)). If, and how, circumferences, including waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC), scale to height remains unclear, but this is an important consideration when developing normative ranges or applying WC/height and HC/height as risk indexes. The study aim was to examine the scaling of weight, WC, and HC to height in NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) III participants. Subjects were adult non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American men (n = 7422) and nonpregnant women (n = 7999) who had complete demographic and anthropometric data. In addition to height, allometric models were developed for each measure that controlled for age, race, and self-reported health status. After adjustment for age and race, weight scaled to height in men and women with mean (±SEE) powers of 2.29 ± 0.11 and 1.80 ± 0.07, respectively (both P<0.001). Although univariate circumference-height models were weak or nonsignificant, when adjusted for age and race WC and HC scaled to height with powers of 0.76 ± 0.08 and 0.45 ± 0.05, respectively, in men and 0.80 ± 0.05 and 0.53 ± 0.04, respectively, in women (all P<0.001). Age- and race-adjusted incremental increases in circumferences ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 cm per centimeter increase in height. Both WC/height and HC/height scaled negatively to height in men and women, and WC/HC scaled negatively to height in women only (all P<0.001). Health status-adjusted models were similar. answer: Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.	yes
question: Can progression of valvar aortic stenosis be predicted accurately? context: It was the aim of the present study to elaborate criteria for the assessment of rapid hemodynamic progression of valvar aortic stenosis. These criteria are of special importance when cardiac surgery is indicated for other reasons but the established criteria for aortic valve replacement are not yet fulfilled. Such aspects of therapeutic planing were mostly disregarded in the past so that patients had to undergo cardiac reoperation within a few years. Hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and clinical data of 169 men and 88 women with aortic stenosis, aged 55.2 +/- 15.7 years at their first and 63.4 +/- 15.6 years at their second cardiac catheterization, were analyzed. The progression rate of aortic valve obstruction was found to be dependent on the degree of valvar calcification ([VC] scoring 0 to III) and to be exponentially correlated with the aortic valve opening area (AVA) at initial catheterization. Neither age nor sex of the patient nor etiology of the valvar obstruction significantly influence the progression of aortic stenosis. If AVA decreases below 0.75 cm(2) with a present degree of VC = 0, or AVA of 0.8 with VC of I, AVA of 0.9 with VC of II, or AVA of 1.0 with VC of III, it is probable that aortic stenosis will have to be operated upon in the following years. answer: The present data indicate that for clinical purposes and planning of valvar surgery the progression of asymptomatic aortic stenosis can be sufficiently predicted by the present aortic valve opening area and the degree of valvar calcification.	yes
question: Does the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale favor left hemisphere strokes? context: The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a valid, reproducible scale that measures neurological deficit. Of 42 possible points, 7 points are directly related to measurement of language compared with only 2 points related to neglect. We examined the placebo arm of the NINDS t-PA stroke trial to test the hypothesis that the total volume of cerebral infarction in patients with right hemisphere strokes would be greater than the volume of cerebral infarction in patients with left hemisphere strokes who have similar NIHSS scores. The volume of stroke was determined by computerized image analysis of CT films and CT images stored on computer tape and optical disks. Cube-root transformation of lesion volume was performed for each CT. Transformed lesion volume was analyzed in a logistic regression model to predict volume of stroke by NIHSS score for each hemisphere. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine the relation between the NIHSS score and lesion volume. The volume for right hemisphere stroke was statistically greater than the volume for left hemisphere strokes, adjusting for the baseline NIHSS (P<0. 001). For each 5-point category of the NIHSS score<20, the median volume of right hemisphere strokes was approximately double the median volume of left hemisphere strokes. For example, for patients with a left hemisphere stroke and a 24-hour NIHSS score of 16 to 20, the median volume of cerebral infarction was 48 mL (interquartile range 14 to 111 mL) as compared with 133 mL (interquartile range 81 to 208 mL) for patients with a right hemisphere stroke (P<0.001). The median volume of a right hemisphere stroke was roughly equal to the median volume of a left hemisphere stroke in the next highest 5-point category of the NIHSS. The Spearman rank correlation between the 24-hour NIHSS score and 3-month lesion volume was 0.72 for patients with left hemisphere stroke and 0.71 for patients with right hemisphere stroke. answer: For a given NIHSS score, the median volume of right hemisphere strokes is consistently larger than the median volume of left hemisphere strokes. The clinical implications of our finding need further exploration.	yes
question: MiraLAX vs. Golytely: is there a significant difference in the adenoma detection rate? context: In recent clinical trials (RCT) of bowel preparation, Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX. We hypothesised that there is a difference in adenoma detection between Golytely and MiraLAX. To compare the adenoma detection rate (ADR) between these bowel preparations, and to identify independent predictors of bowel preparation quality and adenoma detection. This was a post hoc analysis of an RCT that assessed efficacy and patient tolerability of Golytely vs. MiraLAX/Gatorade in average risk screening colonoscopy patients. Bowel preparation quality was measured with the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). An excellent/good equivalent BBPS score was defined as ≥ 7. Polyp pathology review was performed. ADR was defined as the proportion of colonoscopies with an adenoma. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. One hundred and ninety patients were prospectively enrolled (87 MiraLAX, 103 Golytely). Golytely had a higher rate of a BBPS score ≥ 7 (82.5% vs. MiraLAX 67.8%, P=0.02). The ADR in the Golytely cohort was 26.2% (27/103), and was 16.1% (14/87) for MiraLAX (P = 0.091). On multivariate analyses, Golytely was 2.13 × more likely to be associated with a BBPS ≥ 7 (95% CI 1.05-4.32, P = 0.04) and 2.28 × more likely to be associated with adenoma detection (95% CI 1.05-4.98, P = 0.04) than MiraLAX. answer: Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS ≥ 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.	yes
question: Can gingival crevicular blood be relied upon for assessment of blood glucose level? context: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is undiagnosed in approximately half of the patients actually suffering from the disease. In addition, the prevalence of DM is more than twice as high as in patients with periodontitis when compared to periodontally healthy subjects. Thus, a high number of patients with periodontitis may have undiagnosed DM. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether blood oozing from a gingival crevice during routine periodontal examination can be used for determining glucose levels. Observational cross-sectional studies were carried out in 75 patients (43 males and 32 females) with chronic periodontitis who were divided into two groups: Group I and Group II, respectively. Blood oozing from the gingival crevices of anterior teeth following periodontal probing was collected with the stick of glucose self-monitoring device, and the blood glucose levels were measured. At the same time, finger-prick blood was taken for glucometric analysis and subsequent readings were recorded. The patient's blood glucose values ranged from 74 to 256 mg/dl. The comparison between gingival crevicular blood and finger-prick blood showed a very strong correlation, with a t value of 3.97 (at P value = 0.001). answer: The data from this study has shown that GCB collected during diagnostic periodontal examination can be an excellent source of blood for glucometric analysis.	yes
question: Is zero central line-associated bloodstream infection rate sustainable? context: Adoption and implementation of evidence-based measures for catheter care leads to reductions in central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates in the NICU. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether this rate reduction is sustainable for at least 1 year and to identify key determinants of this sustainability at the NICU of the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center. We reviewed the incidence of CLABSIs in the NICU temporally to the implementation of new practice policies and procedures, from July 2008 to December 2013. Adoption of standardized care practices, including bundles and checklists, was associated with a significant reduction of the CLABSI rate to zero for>370 consecutive days in our NICU in 2012. Overall, our CLABSI rates decreased from 4.1 per 1000 line days in 2009 (13 infections; 3163 line days) to 0.94 in 2013 (2 infections; 2115 line days), which represents a 77% reduction over a 5-year period. In the first quarter of 2013, there was a brief increase in CLABSI rate to 3.3 per 1000 line days; after a series of interventions, the CLABSI rate was maintained at zero for>600 days. Ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance with catheter insertion and maintenance practices and improved documentation were identified as key drivers for success. answer: High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.	yes
question: Does treatment duration affect outcome after radiotherapy for prostate cancer? context: The protraction of external beam radiotherapy (RT) time is detrimental in several disease sites. In prostate cancer, the overall treatment time can be considerable, as can the potential for treatment breaks. We evaluated the effect of elapsed treatment time on outcome after RT for prostate cancer. Between April 1989 and November 2004, 1,796 men with prostate cancer were treated with RT alone. The nontreatment day ratio (NTDR) was defined as the number of nontreatment days divided by the total elapsed days of RT. This ratio was used to account for the relationship between treatment duration and total RT dose. Men were stratified into low risk (n = 789), intermediate risk (n = 798), and high risk (n = 209) using a single-factor model. The 10-year freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) rate was 68% for a NTDR<33% vs. 58% for NTDR>/=33% (p = 0.02; BF was defined as a prostate-specific antigen nadir + 2 ng/mL). In the low-risk group, the 10-year FFBF rate was 82% for NTDR<33% vs. 57% for NTDR>/=33% (p = 0.0019). The NTDR was independently predictive for FFBF (p = 0.03), in addition to T stage (p = 0.005) and initial prostate-specific antigen level (p<0.0001) on multivariate analysis, including Gleason score and radiation dose. The NTDR was not a significant predictor of FFBF when examined in the intermediate-risk group, high-risk group, or all risk groups combined. answer: A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.	yes
question: Patient-Controlled Therapy of Breathlessness in Palliative Care: A New Therapeutic Concept for Opioid Administration? context: Breathlessness is one of the most distressing symptoms experienced by patients with advanced cancer and noncancer diagnoses alike. Often, severity of breathlessness increases quickly, calling for rapid symptom control. Oral, buccal, and parenteral routes of provider-controlled drug administration have been described. It is unclear whether patient-controlled therapy (PCT) systems would be an additional treatment option. To investigate whether intravenous opioid PCT can be an effective therapeutic method to reduce breathlessness in patients with advanced disease. Secondary aims were to study the feasibility and acceptance of opioid PCT in patients with refractory breathlessness. This was a pilot observational study with 18 inpatients with advanced disease and refractory breathlessness receiving opioid PCT. Breathlessness was measured on a self-reported numeric rating scale. Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores, Palliative Performance Scale scores, vital signs, and a self-developed patient satisfaction questionnaire were used for measuring secondary outcomes. Descriptive and interference analyses (Friedman test) and post hoc analyses (Wilcoxon tests and Bonferroni corrections) were performed. Eighteen of 815 patients (advanced cancer; median age = 57.5 years [range 36-81]; 77.8% female) received breathlessness symptom control with opioid PCT; daily morphine equivalent dose at Day 1 was median = 20.3 mg (5.0-49.6 mg); Day 2: 13.0 mg (1.0-78.5 mg); Day 3: 16.0 mg (8.3-47.0 mg). Numeric rating scale of current breathlessness decreased (baseline: median = 5 [range 1-10]; Day 1: median = 4 [range 0-8], P < 0.01; Day 2: median = 4 [range 0-5], P < 0.01). Physiological parameters were stable over time. On Day 3, 12/12 patients confirmed that this mode of application provided relief of breathlessness. answer: Opioid PCT is a feasible and acceptable therapeutic method to reduce refractory breathlessness in palliative care patients.	yes
question: Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry? context: To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital. Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored. The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609). answer: We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.	yes
question: Should displaced midshaft clavicular fractures be treated surgically? context: This study was designed to compare clinical effectiveness of operative with nonoperative treatment for displaced midshaft clavicular fractures (DMCF). We systematically searched electronic databases (MEDILINE, EMBASE, CLINICAL, OVID, BIOSIS and Cochrane registry of controlled clinical trials) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which operative treatment was compared with nonoperative treatment for DMCF from 1980 to 2012. The methodologic quality of trials was assessed. Data from chosen studies were pooled with using of fixed-effects and random-effects models with mean differences and risk ratios for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Four RCTs with a total of 321 patients were screened for the present study. Results showed that the operative treatment was superior to the nonoperative treatment regarding the rate of nonunion [95 % confidence interval (CI) (0.05, 0.43), P = 0.0004], malunion [95 % CI (0.06, 0.34), P < 0.00001] and overall complication [95 % CI (0.43-0.76), P = 0.0001]. Subgroup analyses of complications revealed that significant differences were existed in the incidence of neurologic symptoms [95 % CI (0.20, 0.74), P = 0.004] and dissatisfaction with appearance [95 % CI (0.19, 0.65), P = 0.001]. Lack of consistent and standardized assessment data, insufficiency analysis that carried out showed improved functional outcomes (P < 0.05) in operative treatment. answer: The available evidence suggests that the operative treatment for DMCF is associated with a lower rate of nonunion, malunion and complication than nonoperative treatment. This study supports traditional primary operative treatment for DMCF in active adults.	yes
question: Telemedicine and type 1 diabetes: is technology per se sufficient to improve glycaemic control? context: Each patient received a smartphone with an insulin dose advisor (IDA) and with (G3 group) or without (G2 group) the telemonitoring/teleconsultation function. Patients were classified as "high users" if the proportion of "informed" meals using the IDA exceeded 67% (median) and as "low users" if not. Also analyzed was the respective impact of the IDA function and teleconsultations on the final HbA1c levels. Among the high users, the proportion of informed meals remained stable from baseline to the end of the study 6months later (from 78.1±21.5% to 73.8±25.1%; P=0.107), but decreased in the low users (from 36.6±29.4% to 26.7±28.4%; P=0.005). As expected, HbA1c improved in high users from 8.7% [range: 8.3-9.2%] to 8.2% [range: 7.8-8.7%]in patients with (n=26) vs without (n=30) the benefit of telemonitoring/teleconsultation (-0.49±0.60% vs -0.52±0.73%, respectively; P=0.879). However, although HbA1c also improved in low users from 9.0% [8.5-10.1] to 8.5% [7.9-9.6], those receiving support via teleconsultation tended to show greater improvement than the others (-0.93±0.97 vs -0.46±1.05, respectively; P=0.084). answer: The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.	yes
question: Do European people with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet? context: Individuals with type 1 diabetes have a high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, and it has been reported that they consume a high atherogenic diet. We examined how nutrient intake and adherence to current European nutritional recommendations evolved in a large cohort of European individuals with type 1 diabetes over a period of 7 years.SUBJECTS/ We analysed data from the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study, a European multicentre prospective cohort study. Standardized 3-day dietary records were employed in individuals with type 1 diabetes. One thousand one hundred and two patients (553 men, 549 women, baseline age 33 ± 10 years, duration 15 ± 9 years) had complete nutritional data available at baseline and after 7 years. We calculated mean differences in reported nutrients over time and adjusted these for age, gender, HbA1c and BMI with ANOVA models. Compared to baseline, there were minor changes in nutrients. Reported protein (-0.35% energy (en), fat (-1.07% en), saturated fat (-0.25% en) and cholesterol (-7.42 mg/1000 kcal) intakes were lower, whereas carbohydrate (+1.23% en) and fibre (+0.46 g/1000 kcal) intakes were higher at the 7-year follow-up. European recommendations for adequate nutrient intakes were followed in individuals with type 1 diabetes for protein (76% at baseline and 78% at follow-up), moderately for fat (34, 40%), carbohydrate (34, 41%) and cholesterol (39, 47%), but poorly for fibre (1.4, 2.4%) and saturated fat (11, 13%). answer: European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.	yes
question: Preoperative platelet count in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: is it a prognostic factor? context: Platelet count is inversely related to prognosis in many cancers; however, its role in esophageal cancer is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of preoperative platelet count in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). From January 2006 to December 2008, a retrospective analysis of 425 consecutive patients with ESCC was conducted. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for survival prediction was plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for preoperative platelet count. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic parameters. A ROC curve for survival prediction was plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for platelet count, which was 205 (× 10(9)/L). Patients with platelet count ≤ 205 had a significantly better 5-year survival than patients with a platelet count>205 (60.7 vs. 31.6 %, P<0.001). The 5-year survival of patients either with platelet count ≤ 205 or>205 were similar (68.6 vs. 58.8 %, P = 0.085) when the nodes were negative. However, the 5-year survival of patients with platelet count ≤ 205 was better than that of patients with a platelet count>205 when the nodes were involved (32.0 vs. 12.7 %, P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis showed that platelet count (P = 0.013), T grade (P = 0.017), and N staging (P<0.001) were independent prognostic factors. answer: Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (×10(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.	yes
question: Should serum pancreatic lipase replace serum amylase as a biomarker of acute pancreatitis? context: Serum pancreatic lipase may improve the diagnosis of pancreatitis compared to serum amylase. Both enzymes have been measured simultaneously at our hospital allowing for a comparison of their diagnostic accuracy. Seventeen thousand five hundred and thirty-one measurements of either serum amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase were made on 10 931 patients treated at a metropolitan teaching hospital between January 2001 and May 2003. Of these, 8937 were initially treated in the Emergency Department. These results were collected in a database, which was linked by the patients' medical record number to the radiology and medical records. Patients with either an elevated lipase value or a discharge diagnosis of acute pancreatitis had their radiological diagnosis reviewed along with their biochemistry and histology record. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made if there was radiological evidence of peripancreatic inflammation. One thousand eight hundred and twenty-five patients had either elevated serum amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase. The medical records coded for pancreatitis in a further 55 whose enzymes were not elevated. Three hundred and twenty of these had radiological evidence of acute pancreatitis. Receiver operator characteristic analysis of the initial sample from patients received in the Emergency Department showed improved diagnostic accuracy for serum pancreatic lipase (area under the curve (AUC) 0.948) compared with serum amylase (AUC, 0.906, P<0.05). A clinically useful cut-off point would be at the diagnostic threshold; 208 U/L (normal<190 U/L) for serum pancreatic lipase and 114 U/L (normal 27-100 U/L) for serum amylase where the sensitivity was 90.3 cf., 76.8% and the specificity was 93 cf., 92.6%. 18.8% of the acute pancreatitis patients did not have elevated serum amylase while only 2.9% did not have elevated serum pancreatic lipase on the first emergency department measurement. answer: It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.	yes
question: Do Electrochemiluminescence Assays Improve Prediction of Time to Type 1 Diabetes in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet Subjects? context: To explore whether electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can help improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet autoantibody-positive population. TrialNet subjects who were positive for one or more autoantibodies (microinsulin autoantibody, GAD65 autoantibody [GADA], IA-2A, and ZnT8A) with available ECL-insulin autoantibody (IAA) and ECL-GADA data at their initial visit were analyzed; after a median follow-up of 24 months, 177 of these 1,287 subjects developed diabetes. Univariate analyses showed that autoantibodies by radioimmunoassays (RIAs), ECL-IAA, ECL-GADA, age, sex, number of positive autoantibodies, presence of HLA DR3/4-DQ8 genotype, HbA1c, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measurements were all significantly associated with progression to diabetes. Subjects who were ECL positive had a risk of progression to diabetes within 6 years of 58% compared with 5% for the ECL-negative subjects (P<0.0001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were compared, with the base model including age, sex, OGTT measurements, and number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs. The model with positivity for ECL-GADA and/or ECL-IAA was the best, and factors that remained significantly associated with time to diabetes were area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide, fasting C-peptide, AUC glucose, number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs, and ECL positivity. Adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the receiver operating characteristic curves with AUC of 0.83 (P<0.0001). answer: ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.	yes
question: Does SYNTAX score predict in-hospital outcomes in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention? context: SYNTAX score (SxS) has been demonstrated to predict long-term outcomes in stable patients with coronary artery disease. But its prognostic value for patients with acute coronary syndrome remains unknown.AIM: To evaluate whether SxS could predict in-hospital outcomes for patients admitted with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). The study included 538 patients with STEMI who underwent pPCI between January 2010 and December 2012. The patients were divided into two groups: low SxS (<22) and high SxS (>22). The SxS of all patients was calculated from aninitial angiogram and TIMI flow grade of infarct related artery was calculated after pPCI. Left ventricular systolic functions of the patients were evaluated with an echocardiogram in the following week. The rates of reinfarction and mortality during hospitalisation were obtained from the medical records of our hospital. The high SxS group had more no-reflow (41% and 25.1%, p<0.001, respectively), lower ejection fraction (38.2 ± 7.5% and 44.6 ± 8.8%, p<0.001, respectively), and greater rates of re-infarction (9.5% and 7.3%, p = 0.037, respectively) and mortality (0.9% and 0.2%, p = 0.021, respectively) during hospitalisation compared to the low SxS group. On multivariate logistic regression analysis including clinical variables, SxS was an independent predictor of no-reflow (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.032-1.133, p = 0.001). answer: SxS is a useful tool that can predict in-hospital outcomes of patients with STEMI undergoing pPCI.	yes
question: Are behavioural risk factors to be blamed for the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans? context: Longitudinal cohort studies in sub-Saharan Africa are urgently needed to understand cardiovascular disease development. We, therefore, explored health behaviours and conventional risk factors of African individuals with optimal blood pressure (BP) (≤ 120/80 mm Hg), and their 5-year prediction for the development of hypertension. The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology study in the North West Province, South Africa, started in 2005 and included African volunteers (n = 1994; aged>30 years) from a sample of 6000 randomly selected households in rural and urban areas. At baseline, 48% of the participants were hypertensive (≥ 140/90 mmHg). Those with optimal BP (n = 478) were followed at a success rate of 70% for 5 years (213 normotensive, 68 hypertensive, 57 deceased). Africans that became hypertensive smoked more than the normotensive individuals (68.2% vs 49.8%), and they also had a greater waist circumference [ratio of geometric means of 0.94 cm (95% CI: 0.86-0.99)] and greater amount of γ-glutamyltransferase [0.74 U/l (95% CI: 0.62-0.88)]at baseline. The 5-year change in BP was independently explained by baseline γ-glutamyltransferase [R(2) = 0.23, β = 0.13 U/l (95% CI: 0.01-0.19)]. Alcohol intake also predicted central systolic BP and carotid cross-sectional wall area (CSWA) at follow-up. Waist circumference was another predictor of BP changes [β = 0.18 cm (95% CI: 0.05-0.24)]and CSWA. HIV infection was inversely associated with increased BP. answer: During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.	yes
question: Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement? context: There are a number of factors responsible for the longevity of unicompartmental knee replacements (UKR). These include the magnitude of postoperative alignment and the type of material used. The effect of component design and material on postoperative alignment, however, has not been explored. We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients who underwent UKR with robotic guidance. Patients were divided into two groups, according to whether they had received an all-polyethylene inlay component (Inlay group) or a metal-backed onlay component (Onlay group). We explored the magnitude of mechanical alignment correction obtained in both groups. Mean postoperative mechanical alignment was significantly closer to neutral in the Onlay group (mean=2.8°; 95% CI=2.4°, 3.2°) compared to the Inlay group (mean=3.9°; 95% CI=3.4°, 4.4°) (R2=0.65; P=0.003), adjusting for gender, BMI, age, side and preoperative mechanical alignment (Fig. 2). Further exploration revealed that the thickness of the tibial polyethyelene insert had a significant effect on postoperative alignment when added to the model (R2=0.68; P=0.01). answer: Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses. The thicker overall construct of Onlay prostheses appears to be an important determinant of postoperative alignment. Considering their higher survivorship rates and improved postoperative mechanical alignment, Onlay prostheses should be the first option when performing medial UKR.	yes
question: Upstream solutions: does the supplemental security income program reduce disability in the elderly? context: The robust relationship between socioeconomic factors and health suggests that social and economic policies might substantially affect health, while other evidence suggests that medical care, the main focus of current health policy, may not be the primary determinant of population health. Income support policies are one promising avenue to improve population health. This study examines whether the federal cash transfer program to poor elderly, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, affects old-age disability. This study uses the 1990 and 2000 censuses, employing state and year fixed-effect models, to test whether within-state changes in maximum SSI benefits over time lead to changes in disability among people aged sixty-five and older. Higher benefits are linked to lower disability rates. Among all single elderly individuals, 30 percent have mobility limitations, and an increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit caused the rate of mobility limitations to fall by 0.46 percentage points. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. First, analyses limited to those most likely to receive SSI produced larger effects, but analyses limited to those least likely to receive SSI produced no measurable effect. Second, varying the disability measure did not meaningfully alter the findings. Third, excluding the institutionalized, immigrants, individuals living in states with exceptionally large benefit changes, and individuals living in states with no SSI supplements did not change the substantive conclusions. Fourth, Medicaid did not confound the effects. Finally, these results were robust for married individuals. answer: Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.	yes
question: Can serum be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer? context: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as prognostic or predictive marker in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been used widely. However, it may be difficult to get tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in large proportion of patients with advanced disease. We obtained pairs of tumor and serum samples from 57 patients with advanced NSCLC, between March 2006 and January 2009. EGFR mutation status from tumor samples was analyzed by genomic polymerase chain reaction and direct sequence and EGFR mutation status from serum samples was determined by the peptide nucleic acid locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp. EGFR mutations were detected in the serum samples of 11 patients and in the tumor samples of 12 patients. EGFR mutation status in the serum and tumor samples was consistent in 50 of the 57 pairs (87.7%). There was a high correlation between the mutations detected in serum sample and the mutations detected in the matched tumor sample (correlation index 0.62; P<0.001). Twenty-two of 57 patients (38.5%) received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors as any line therapy. The response for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors was significantly associated with EGFR mutations in both tumor samples and serum samples (P<0.05). There was no significant differences in overall survival according to the status of EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples (P>0.05). answer: Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.	yes
question: Are failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction associated with steep posterior tibial slopes? context: Recently, increasing number of literature has identified the posterior tibial slope (PTS) as one of the risk factors of primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, few studies concerning the association between failure of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and PTS have been published. The objective of this study was to explore the association between the failure of ACLR and PTS at a minimum of two years follow-up. Two hundred and thirty eight eligible patients from June 2009 to October 2010 were identified from our database. A total of 20 failure cases of ACLR and 20 randomly selected controls were included in this retrospective study. The demographic data and the results of manual maximum side-to-side difference with KT-1000 arthrometer at 30° of knee flexion and pivot-shift test before the ACLR and at the final follow-up were collected. The medial and lateral PTSs were measured using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, based on Hudek's measurement. A comparison of PTS between the two groups was performed. The overall failure rate of the present study was 8.4%. Of the 40 participants, the mean medial PTS was 4.1° ± 3.2° and the mean lateral PTS was 4.6° ± 2.6°. The medial PTS of the ACLR failure group was significantly steeper than the control group (3.5° ± 2.5° vs. 6.1° ± 2.1°, P = 0.000). Similarly, the lateral PTS of the ACLR failure group was significantly steeper than the control group (2.9° ± 2.1° vs. 5.5° ± 3.0°, P = 0.006). For medial PTS ≥ 5°, the odds ratio of ACLR failure was 6.8 (P = 0.007); for lateral PTS ≥5°, the odds ratio of ACLR failure was 10.8 (P = 0.000). answer: Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS ≥5° was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.	yes
question: Do teleoncology models of care enable safe delivery of chemotherapy in rural towns? context: To compare the dose intensity and toxicity profiles for patients undergoing chemotherapy at the Townsville Cancer Centre (TCC), a tertiary cancer centre in northern Queensland, with those for patients treated in Mount Isa, supervised by the same medical oncologists via teleoncology. A quasi-experimental design comparing two patient groups. TCC and Mount Isa Hospital, which both operate under the auspices of the Townsville Teleoncology Network (TTN). Eligible patients who received chemotherapy at TCC or Mt Isa Hospital between 1 May 2007 and 30 April 2012. Teleoncology model for managing cancer patients in rural towns. Dose intensity (doses, number of cycles and lines of treatment) and toxicity rates (rate of serious side effects, hospital admissions and mortality). Over 5 years, 89 patients received a total of 626 cycles of various chemotherapy regimens in Mount Isa. During the same period, 117 patients who received a total of 799 cycles of chemotherapy at TCC were eligible for inclusion in the comparison group. There were no significant differences between the Mount Isa and TCC patients in most demographic characteristics, mean numbers of treatment cycles, dose intensities, proportions of side effects, and hospital admissions. There were no toxicity-related deaths in either group. answer: It appears safe to administer chemotherapy in rural towns under the supervision of medical oncologists from larger centres via teleoncology, provided that rural health care resources and governance arrangements are adequate.	yes
question: Is solitary kidney really more resistant to ischemia? context: To our knowledge there are no evidence-based medicine data to date to critically judge the vulnerability of a solitary kidney to warm ischemia compared to paired kidneys. Ten dogs were exposed to open right nephrectomy to create a solitary kidney model (group 1). Ten dogs with both kidneys were considered group 2. All dogs underwent warm ischemia by open occlusion of the left renal artery for 90 minutes. Dogs were sacrificed at different intervals (3 days to 4 weeks). All dogs were reevaluated by renogram before sacrifice and histopathology of the investigated kidney. The proinflammatory markers CD95 and tumor necrosis factor-α were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In group 1 clearance decreased by 20% at 1 week but basal function was regained starting at week 2. In group 2 clearance decreased more than 90% up to week 2. Recovery started at week 3 and by 4 weeks there was a 23% clearance reduction. Histopathological examination in group 1 revealed significant tubular necrosis (60%) at 3 days with regeneration starting at 1 week. In group 2 there was more pronounced tubular necrosis (90%) with regeneration starting at 2 weeks. The expression of proinflammatory markers was up-regulated in each group with higher, more sustained expression in group 2. answer: Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.	yes
question: Is it safe to perform rectal anastomosis in gynaecological debulking surgery without a diverting stoma? context: Patient data were retrospectively collected from a database for gynaecological cancer procedures carried out between January 2013 and July 2015. All patients who underwent a colorectal resection during cytoreduction were included in the study. The primary outcome was anastomotic leakage in the presence or absence of a diverting stoma. Secondary outcome parameters were complications and reoperations. In the period of study, 43 major colorectal procedures were performed on 37 women. The most common colorectal procedure was low rectal resection (n = 22; 59%) followed by anterior rectal resection (n = 7; 19%) and sigmoid resection (n = 4; 11%). Five (14%) patients underwent Hartmann's procedure. In three (8%) patients, a diverting loop ileostomy was created. answer: Low rectal resection during debulking procedures for gynaecological cancers with peritoneal carcinomatosis can safely be performed by an experienced surgeon without a diverting stoma.	yes
question: Has the mammography quality standards act affected the mammography quality in North Carolina? context: The United States Food and Drug Administration implemented federal regulations governing mammography under the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) of 1992. During 1995, its first year in implementation, we examined the impact of the MQSA on the quality of mammography in North Carolina. All mammography facilities were inspected during 1993-1994, and again in 1995. Both inspections evaluated mean glandular radiation dose, phantom image evaluation, darkroom fog, and developer temperature. Two mammography health specialists employed by the North Carolina Division of Radiation Protection performed all inspections and collected and codified data. The percentage of facilities that met quality standards increased from the first inspection to the second inspection. Phantom scores passing rate was 31.6% versus 78.2%; darkroom fog passing rate was 74.3% versus 88.5%; and temperature difference passing rate was 62.4% versus 86.9%. answer: In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.	yes
question: Is breast cancer prognosis inherited? context: A genetic component is well established in the etiology of breast cancer. It is not well known, however, whether genetic traits also influence prognostic features of the malignant phenotype. We carried out a population-based cohort study in Sweden based on the nationwide Multi-Generation Register. Among all women with breast cancer diagnosed from 1961 to 2001, 2,787 mother-daughter pairs and 831 sister pairs with breast cancer were identified; we achieved complete follow-up and classified 5-year breast cancer-specific prognosis among proband (mother or oldest sister) into tertiles as poor, intermediary, or good. We used Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival proportions and Cox models to calculate relative risks of dying from breast cancer within 5 years depending on the proband's outcome. The 5-year survival proportion among daughters whose mothers died within 5 years was 87% compared to 91% if the mother was alive (p = 0.03). Among sisters, the corresponding proportions were 70% and 88%, respectively (p = 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, daughters and sisters of a proband with poor prognosis had a 60% higher 5-year breast cancer mortality compared to those of a proband with good prognosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 2.2; p for trend 0.002). This association was slightly stronger among sisters (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.4) than among daughters (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.3). answer: Breast cancer prognosis of a woman predicts the survival in her first-degree relatives with breast cancer. Our novel findings suggest that breast cancer prognosis might be inherited.	yes
question: c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells: a potential therapeutic target? context: This study was conducted to investigate the expression and functional impact of the proto-oncogene c-kit in uveal melanoma. Based on immunohistochemical (IHC) study of paraffin-embedded specimens from 134 uveal melanomas and Western blot analysis on eight fresh-frozen samples the expression of c-kit in uveal melanoma was studied. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-kit and the impact of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was examined in the three uveal melanoma cell lines OCM-1, OCM-3, and 92-1. Eighty-four of 134 paraffin-embedded samples and six of eight fresh-frozen samples expressed c-kit. c-Kit was strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells compared with cutaneous melanoma cells. Moreover, in contrast to cutaneous melanoma cell lines c-kit maintained a high phosphorylation level in serum-depleted uveal melanoma cells. No activation-related mutations in exon 11 of the KIT gene were found. On the contrary, expression of the stem cell growth factor (c-kit ligand) was detected in all three uveal melanoma cell lines, suggesting the presence of autocrine (paracrine) stimulation pathways. Treatment of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, resulted in cell death. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was of equal size and less than 2.5 microM. answer: The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.	yes
question: Pituitary apoplexy: do histological features influence the clinical presentation and outcome? context: A retrospective analysis of a contemporary series of patients with pituitary apoplexy was performed to ascertain whether the histopathological features influence the clinical presentation or the outcome. A retrospective analysis was performed in 59 patients treated for pituitary apoplexy at the University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia, or Groote Schuur Hospital, University of Cape Town, South Africa. The patients were divided into two groups according to the histological features of their disease: one group with infarction alone, comprising 22 patients; and the other with hemorrhagic infarction and/or frank hemorrhage, comprising 37 patients. The presenting symptoms, clinical features, endocrinological status, and outcome were compared between the two groups. answer: The patients who presented with histological features of pituitary tumor infarction alone had less severe clinical features on presentation, a longer course prior to presentation, and a better outcome than those presenting with hemorrhagic infarction or frank hemorrhage. The endocrine replacement requirements were similar in both groups.	yes
question: Orthostatic myoclonus: an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness? context: Recently, orthostatic myoclonus (OM) has been suggested as a cause of gait impairment and unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of orthostatic myoclonus, its clinical characteristics and the underlying associated neurological disorders. A retrospective analysis of clinical data and electromyogram surface recordings from subjects with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment was performed. Diagnosis of OM was made when a pattern of non-rhythmic bursts was observed (duration range 20-100 ms; bursts per second ≤16). Among 93 subjects studied, OM was the most frequent disorder (n = 16; 17.2%), followed by orthostatic tremor (13.9%) and low frequency tremors during orthostatism (12.9%). All patients with OM complained about unsteadiness during orthostatism and/or during gait. Leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during orthostatism in four subjects and two also presented falls. Eleven out of 16 patients (68.7%) with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease, such as multiple system atrophy (n = 3) Parkinson's disease (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease (n = 2), mild cognitive impairment (n = 2) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 2). Although four subjects showed improvement of orthostatic myoclonus with antimyoclonic treatment, the follow-up was not systematic enough to evaluate their therapeutic effect on OM. answer: Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.	yes
question: Is low serum chloride level a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality? context: Serum chloride level is routinely assayed in clinical laboratories in the management of patients with kidney disorders and with metabolic diseases. It is a biological parameter that is easily, precisely and relatively cheaply measured. The epidemiological features of serum chloride levels have not been studied before. For the random sample of men and women from the Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health aged 25-74 years, free of symptomatic coronary heart disease at baseline, serum chloride concentrations were measured, among those of other electrolytes. The cohort was followed up for 10 years with respect to subsequent cause-specific mortality. The results are based on observations of 4793 men and 4313 women. According to Cox regression analysis serum chloride level was one of the strongest predictors of total, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD mortalities independently of age, body mass index, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, levels of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, serum creatinine and serum total proteins and intake of diuretics. This relation was proved to be independent of levels of other serum electrolytes and similar for men and women. The estimated adjusted risk ratio for CVD death for subjects with a serum chloride level<or =100 mmol/l compared with those with levels above that limit was 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.57) for men and 2.16 (95% confidence interval 1.11-4.22) for women. The study of adjusted risk ratios for four groups of subjects defined on the basis of their baseline serum chloride levels revealed a decreasing log-linear 'dose-response' relation to total and cardiovascular mortalities. answer: This s the first report from a population-based study to indicate that there is an association between serum chloride level and the incidence of total, CVD and non-CVD mortalities. The risk ratio for CVD mortality associated with a low serum chloride level was comparable to or higher than those observed for well-established CVD risk factors.	yes
question: Does ethnicity affect where people with cancer die? context: Ageing is a growing issue for people from UK black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups. The health experiences of these groups are recognised as a 'tracer' to measure success in end of life patient-preferred outcomes that includes place of death (PoD).AIM: To examine patterns in PoD among BAME groups who died of cancer. Mortality data for 93,375 cancer deaths of those aged ≥65 years in London from 2001-2010 were obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). Decedent's country of birth was used as a proxy for ethnicity. Linear regression examined trends in place of death across the eight ethnic groups and Poisson regression examined the association between country of birth and place of death. 76% decedents were born in the UK, followed by Ireland (5.9%), Europe(5.4%) and Caribbean(4.3%). Most deaths(52.5%) occurred in hospital, followed by home(18.7%). During the study period, deaths in hospital declined with an increase in home deaths; trend for time analysis for those born in UK(0.50%/yr[0.36-0.64%]p<0.001), Europe (1.00%/yr[0.64-1.30%]p<0.001), Asia(1.09%/yr[0.94-1.20%]p<0.001) and Caribbean(1.03%/yr[0.72-1.30%]p<0.001). However, time consistent gaps across the geographical groups remained. Following adjustment hospital deaths were more likely for those born in Asia(Proportion ratio(PR)1.12[95%CI1.08-1.15]p<0.001) and Africa(PR 1.11[95%CI1.07-1.16]p<0.001). Hospice deaths were less likely for those born in Asia(PR 0.73 [0.68-0.80] p<0.001), Africa (PR 0.83[95%CI0.74-0.93]p<0.001), and 'other' geographical regions (PR0.90[95% 0.82-0.98]p<0.001). Home deaths were less likely for those born in the Caribbean(PR0.91[95%CI 0.85-0.98]p<0.001). answer: Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.	yes
question: Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients: are marginally acceptable hearts suitable for transplantation? context: The brain-dead donor supply has become one of the criteria limiting the performance of heart transplantation. Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible. Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%. Of the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died: 2 from hemorrhage (FAC>50% in donors); 1 from right and one from left ventricular dysfunction (FAC<50% in donors). The FAC increased significantly from 51 +/- 15% to 57 +/- 11% in 18 hearts that underwent TEE in donors and afterwards in recipients. Overall actuarial survival was 86.2% versus 64.6% at 1 and 2 years in group H1 and group H2, respectively (p = NS). answer: TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.	yes
question: Can the postoperative pain level be predicted preoperatively? context: We searched for factors present preoperatively which could be used to predict the intensity of postoperative pain. We undertook a prospective study among all patients aged over 18 years who underwent shoulder surgery from January to September 2004 in our unit. The study included 86 patients for which the following data were noted preoperatively: past history of pain, intensity and duration of prior pain, triggering factors, localization, psychological context. The intensity of the postoperative pain was measured on a visual analog scale (VAS); measurements were noted up to 24 hours postop then at one month. Data processing was performed with Statview5.5. Significant postoperative pain was correlated with a prior history of surgical pain, with duration of prior pain, with intensity of preoperative pain, and with depression. Significant sustained preoperative pain can favor memory of pain leading to postoperative sensitivization of nociception neurons. Intense postoperative pain can favor the development of refractory chronic pain. answer: Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.	yes
question: Does age moderate the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients? context: To examine age-related differences in the relationship between personality and coping strategies in an Australian population of psychiatric inpatients. Consenting eligible adults (N=238) from 18-100 years of age consecutively admitted to inpatient psychiatry units were assessed using the SCID I and II, the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced Scale (COPE), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), the 12 Item Short-Form Heath Survey (SF12), the Sarason Social Support Questionnaire, and the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) (cognitively impaired, and non-English speaking patients were excluded). Older adults reported less symptomatology than younger patients and younger patients described more personality dysfunction than older patients. As assessed by the COPE, older adults reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger adults. Personality traits, social supports, gender, and age predicted coping strategies, while Axis I diagnosis, education, personality disorder, and symptom severity were not significant predictors of coping strategies. answer: This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.	yes
question: Is neck pain associated with worse health-related quality of life 6 months later? context: Current evidence suggests that neck pain is negatively associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, these studies are cross-sectional and do not inform the association between neck pain and future HRQoL. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between increasing grades of neck pain severity and HRQoL 6 months later. In addition, this longitudinal study examines the crude association between the course of neck pain and HRQoL. This is a population-based cohort study. Eleven hundred randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults were included. Outcome measures were the mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary (PCS) of the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. We formed a cohort of 1,100 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults in September 1995. We used the Chronic Pain Questionnaire to measure neck pain and its related disability. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure physical and mental HRQoL 6 months later. Multivariable linear regression was used to measure the association between graded neck pain and HRQoL while controlling for confounding. Analysis of variance and t tests were used to measure the crude association among four possible courses of neck pain and HRQoL at 6 months. The neck pain trajectories over 6 months were no or mild neck pain, improving neck pain, worsening neck pain, and persistent neck pain. Finally, analysis of variance was used to examine changes in baseline to 6-month PCS and MCS scores among the four neck pain trajectory groups. The 6-month follow-up rate was 74.9%. We found an exposure-response relationship between neck pain and physical HRQoL after adjusting for age, education, arthritis, low back pain, and depressive symptomatology. Compared with participants without neck pain at baseline, those with mild (β=-1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]=-2.83, -0.24), intense (β=-3.60, 95% CI=-5.76, -1.44), or disabling (β=-8.55, 95% CI=-11.68, -5.42) neck pain had worse physical HRQoL 6 months later. We did not find an association between neck pain and mental HRQoL. A worsening course of neck pain and persistent neck pain were associated with worse physical HRQoL. answer: We found that neck pain was negatively associated with physical but not mental HRQoL. Our analysis suggests that neck pain may be a contributor of future poor physical HRQoL in the population. Raising awareness of the possible future impact of neck pain on physical HRQoL is important for health-care providers and policy makers with respect to the management of neck pain in populations.	yes
question: Dose end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement correlate with arterial carbon dioxide in extremely low birth weight infants in the first week of life? context: To study the correlation and agreement between end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) in ventilated extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants in the first week of life. Retrospective chart review of all ELBW (<1,000 g) infants admitted to a level III NICU from January 2003 to December 2003. Data collected included demographic details and simultaneous EtCO(2) (mainstream capnography) and arterial blood gas values (pH, PaCO(2), PaO(2)). The correlation coefficient, degree of bias with 95% confidence interval between the EtCO(2) and PaCO(2). There were 754 end-tidal and arterial CO(2) pairs from 31 ELBW infants (21 male and 10 female). The overall EtCO(2) values were significantly lower than PaCO(2) value. In only 89/754(11.8%) pairs, the EtCO(2) was higher than the PaCO(2). The overall bias was 5.6 +/- 6.9 mmHg (95% C.I. 5.11-6.09). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.81. Using EtCO2 ranges of 30 to 50 mmHg, the capnographic method was able to identify 84% of instances where PaCO(2) was between 35 (<35 = hypocarbia) and 55 mmHg (>55= hypercapnia). answer: There is good correlation and agreement between end-tidal CO(2) and arterial CO(2) in ELBW infants in the EtCO(2) range 30-50 mmHg. End-tidal CO(2) monitoring can be helpful in trending or for screening abnormal PaCO(2) values in ELBW infants in first week of life.	yes
question: Does Residency Selection Criteria Predict Performance in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency? context: More than 1000 candidates applied for orthopaedic residency positions in 2014, and the competition is intense; approximately one-third of the candidates failed to secure a position in the match. However, the criteria used in the selection process often are subjective and studies have differed in terms of which criteria predict either objective measures or subjective ratings of resident performance by faculty.QUESTIONS/ Do preresidency selection factors serve as predictors of success in residency? Specifically, we asked which preresidency selection factors are associated or correlated with (1) objective measures of resident knowledge and performance; and (2) subjective ratings by faculty. Charts of 60 orthopaedic residents from our institution were reviewed. Preresidency selection criteria examined included United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 scores, Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, number of letters of recommendation, number of away rotations, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical society membership, fourth-year subinternship at our institution, and number of publications. Resident performance was assessed using objective measures including American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores and subjective ratings by faculty including global evaluation scores and faculty rankings of residents. We tested associations between preresidency criteria and the subsequent objective and subjective metrics using linear correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney tests when appropriate. Objective measures of resident performance namely, ABOS Part I scores, had a moderate linear correlation with the USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.55, p<0.001) and number of clinical honors received in medical school (r = 0.45, p<0.001). OITE scores had a weak linear correlation with the number of clinical honors (r = 0.35, p = 0.009) and USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.29, p = 0.02). With regards to subjective outcomes, AOA membership was associated with higher scores on the global evaluation (p = 0.005). AOA membership also correlated with higher global evaluation scores (r = 0.60, p = 0.005) with the strongest correlation existing between AOA membership and the "interpersonal and communication skills" subsection of the global evaluations. answer: We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be "high yield" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.	yes
question: Is CA72-4 a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer? context: Surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer. Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. High CA125 concentrations were observed in patients with ovarian endometriosis and in those with ovarian cancer. A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer (71.0%) and patients with endometriosis (13.8%) (P<0.0001). answer: This study suggests that CA72-4 determination can be useful to confirm the benign nature of ovarian endometriomas in women with high CA125 levels.	yes
question: Is the breast best for children with a family history of atopy? context: Previous studies reported that breast-feeding protects children against a variety of diseases, but these studies were generally conducted on "high-risk" or hospitalized children. This paper describes the results of our study on the effects of breast-feeding on rate of illness in normal children with a family history of atopy. A historic cohort approach of 794 children with a family history of atopy was used to assess the effects of breast-feeding on illness rates. Family history of atopy was based on allergic diseases in family members as registered by the family physician. Illness data from birth onwards were available from the Continuous Morbidity Registration of the Department of Family Medicine. Information on breast-feeding was collected by postal questionnaire. We then compared rates of illness between children with a family history of atopy who were and who were not breast-fed. Breast-feeding was related to lower levels of childhood illness both in the first and the first three years of life. In the first year of life they had fewer episodes of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, and digestive tract disorders. Over the next three years of life they had fewer respiratory tract infections and skin infections. answer: Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.	yes
question: Is Bare-Metal Stent Implantation Still Justifiable in High Bleeding Risk Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention? context: This study sought to investigate the ischemic and bleeding outcomes of patients fulfilling high bleeding risk (HBR) criteria who were randomized to zotarolimus-eluting Endeavor Sprint stent (E-ZES) or bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation followed by an abbreviated dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration for stable or unstable coronary artery disease. DES instead of BMS use remains controversial in HBR patients, in whom long-term DAPT poses safety concerns. The ZEUS (Zotarolimus-Eluting Endeavor Sprint Stent in Uncertain DES Candidates) is a multinational, randomized single-blinded trial that randomized among others, in a stratified manner, 828 patients fulfilling pre-defined clinical or biochemical HBR criteria-including advanced age, indication to oral anticoagulants or other pro-hemorrhagic medications, history of bleeding and known anemia-to receive E-ZES or BMS followed by a protocol-mandated 30-day DAPT regimen. The primary endpoint of the study was the 12-month major adverse cardiovascular event rate, consisting of death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization. Compared with patients without, those with 1 or more HBR criteria had worse outcomes, owing to higher ischemic and bleeding risks. Among HBR patients, major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 22.6% of the E-ZES and 29% of the BMS patients (hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.57 to 0.98; p = 0.033), driven by lower myocardial infarction (3.5% vs. 10.4%; p<0.001) and target vessel revascularization (5.9% vs. 11.4%; p = 0.005) rates in the E-ZES arm. The composite of definite or probable stent thrombosis was significantly reduced in E-ZES recipients, whereas bleeding events did not differ between stent groups. answer: Among HBR patients with stable or unstable coronary artery disease, E-ZES implantation provides superior efficacy and safety as compared with conventional BMS. (Zotarolimus-Eluting Endeavor Sprint Stent in Uncertain DES Candidates [ZEUS]; NCT01385319).	yes
question: Marital status, living arrangement and mortality: does the association vary by gender? context: Men appear to benefit more from being married than women with respect to mortality in middle age. However, there is some uncertainty about gender differences in mortality risks in older individuals, widowed, divorced and single individuals and about the impact of living arrangements. Longitudinal data with 1990 census records being linked to mortality data up to 2005 were used (Swiss National Cohort). The sample comprised all residents over age 44 years in Switzerland (n=2,440,242). All-cause mortality HRs for marital status and living arrangements were estimated by Cox regression for men and women and different age groups with adjustment for education and socio-professional category. The benefit of being married was stronger for men than for women; however, mortality patterns were similar, with higher mortality in divorced and single individuals compared with widowed individuals (<80 years). After adjustment for living arrangements, the gender difference by marital status disappeared. Stratification by living arrangement revealed that mortality risks were highest for 45-64-year-old divorced (HR 1.72 (95% CI 1.67 to 1.76)) and single men (HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.71)) who lived alone. In women of the same age, the highest mortality risk was observed for those who were single and living with a partner (HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.82)). In older age groups, the impact of marital status decreased. answer: Evaluation of living arrangements is crucial for identifying and explaining gender differences in mortality risks by marital status. The impact of living alone and living with a partner seems to be different in men and women.	yes
question: Does ibuprofen increase perioperative blood loss during hip arthroplasty? context: To determine whether prior exposure of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increases perioperative blood loss associated with major orthopaedic surgery. Fifty patients scheduled for total hip replacement were allocated to two groups (double blind, randomized manner). All patients were pretreated for 2 weeks before surgery: Group 1 with placebo drug, Group 2 with ibuprofen. All patients were injected intrathecally with bupivacaine 20mg plus morphine 0.1 mg, in a total volume of 4 mL, to provide surgical anaesthesia. The presence of severe adverse effects caused eight patients in the ibuprofen group and six in the placebo group to terminate their participation in the trial. The perioperative blood loss increased by 45% in the ibuprofen group compared with placebo. The total (+/-SD) blood loss in the ibuprofen group was 1161 (+/-472) mL versus 796 (+/-337) mL in the placebo group. answer: Pretreatment with ibuprofen before elective total hip surgery increases the perioperative blood loss significantly. Early discontinuation of non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is advised.	yes
question: Can magnetic resonance imaging accurately predict concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection? context: To correlate magnetic resonance (MR) image findings with pain response by provocation discography in patients with discogenic low back pain, with an emphasis on the combination analysis of a high intensity zone (HIZ) and disc contour abnormalities. Sixty-two patients (aged 17-68 years) with axial low back pain that was likely to be disc related underwent lumbar discography (178 discs tested). The MR images were evaluated for disc degeneration, disc contour abnormalities, HIZ, and endplate abnormalities. Based on the combination of an HIZ and disc contour abnormalities, four classes were determined: (1) normal or bulging disc without HIZ; (2) normal or bulging disc with HIZ; (3) disc protrusion without HIZ; (4) disc protrusion with HIZ. These MR image findings and a new combined MR classification were analyzed in the base of concordant pain determined by discography. Disc protrusion with HIZ [sensitivity 45.5%; specificity 97.8%; positive predictive value (PPV), 87.0%] correlated significantly with concordant pain provocation (P<0.01). A normal or bulging disc with HIZ was not associated with reproduction of pain. Disc degeneration (sensitivity 95.4%; specificity 38.8%; PPV 33.9%), disc protrusion (sensitivity 68.2%; specificity 80.6%; PPV 53.6%), and HIZ (sensitivity 56.8%; specificity 83.6%; PPV 53.2%) were not helpful in the identification of a disc with concordant pain. answer: The proposed MR classification is useful to predict a disc with concordant pain. Disc protrusion with HIZ on MR imaging predicted positive discography in patients with discogenic low back pain.	yes
question: Does case-mix based reimbursement stimulate the development of process-oriented care delivery? context: Reimbursement based on the total care of a patient during an acute episode of illness is believed to stimulate management and clinicians to reduce quality problems like waiting times and poor coordination of care delivery. Although many studies already show that this kind of case-mix based reimbursement leads to more efficiency, it remains unclear whether care coordination improved as well. This study aims to explore whether case-mix based reimbursement stimulates development of care coordination by the use of care programmes, and a process-oriented way of working. Data for this study were gathered during the winter of 2007/2008 in a survey involving all Dutch hospitals. Descriptive and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses were conducted. SEM reveals that adoption of the case-mix reimbursement within hospitals' budgeting processes stimulates hospitals to establish care programmes by the use of process-oriented performance measures. However, the implementation of care programmes is not (yet) accompanied by a change in focus from function (the delivery of independent care activities) to process (the delivery of care activities as being connected to a chain of interdependent care activities). answer: This study demonstrates that hospital management can stimulate the development of care programmes by the adoption of case-mix reimbursement within hospitals' budgeting processes. Future research is recommended to confirm this finding and to determine whether the establishment of care programmes will in time indeed lead to a more process-oriented view of professionals.	yes
question: Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link? context: Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis. A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal. answer: [corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.	yes
question: Is the determination of specific IgE against components using ISAC 112 a reproducible technique? context: The ImmunoCAP ISAC 112 is a fluoro-immunoassay that allows detection of specific IgE to 112 molecular components from 51 allergenic sources. We studied the reliability of this technique intra- and inter- assay, as well as inter-batch- and inter-laboratory-assay. Twenty samples were studied, nineteen sera from polysensitized allergic patients, and the technique calibrator provided by the manufacturer (CTR02). We measured the sIgE from CTR02 and three patients' sera ten times in the same and in different assays. Furthermore, all samples were tested in two laboratories and with two batches of ISAC kit. To evaluate the accuracy of ISAC 112, we contrasted the determinations of CTR02 calibrator with their expected values by T Student test. To analyse the precision, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of the 15 allergens that generate the calibration curve, and to analyse the repeatability and the reproducibility, we calculated the intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) to each allergen. The results obtained for CTR02 were similar to those expected in 7 of 15 allergens that generate the calibration curve, whereas in 8 allergens the results showed significant differences. The mean CV obtained in the CTR02 determinations was of 9.4%, and the variability of sera from patients was of 22.9%. The agreement in the intra- and inter-assay analysis was very good to 94 allergens and good to one. In the inter-batch analyse, we obtained a very good agreement to 82 allergens, good to 14, moderate to 5 allergens, poor to one, and bad to 1 allergen. In the inter-laboratory analyse, we obtained a very good agreement to 73 allergens, good to 22, moderate to 6 and poor to two allergens. answer: The allergen microarray immunoassay, ISAC 112, is a repeatable and reproducible in vitro diagnostic tool for determination of sIgE beyond the own laboratory.	yes
question: Schizophrenia patients with high intelligence: A clinically distinct sub-type of schizophrenia? context: Schizophrenia patients are typically found to have low IQ both pre- and post-onset, in comparison to the general population. However, a subgroup of patients displays above average IQ pre-onset. The nature of these patients' illness and its relationship to typical schizophrenia is not well understood. The current study sought to investigate the symptom profile of high-IQ schizophrenia patients. We identified 29 schizophrenia patients of exceptionally high pre-morbid intelligence (mean estimated pre-morbid intelligence quotient (IQ) of 120), of whom around half also showed minimal decline (less than 10 IQ points) from their estimated pre-morbid IQ. We compared their symptom scores (SAPS, SANS, OPCRIT, MADRS, GAF, SAI-E) with a comparison group of schizophrenia patients of typical IQ using multinomial logistic regression. The patients with very high pre-morbid IQ had significantly lower scores on negative and disorganised symptoms than typical patients (RRR=0.019; 95% CI=0.001, 0.675, P=0.030), and showed better global functioning and insight (RRR=1.082; 95% CI=1.020, 1.148; P=0.009). Those with a minimal post-onset IQ decline also showed higher levels of manic symptoms (RRR=8.213; 95% CI=1.042, 64.750, P=0.046). answer: These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.	yes
question: Is halofantrine ototoxic? context: Halofantrine is a newly developed antimalarial drug used for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The introduction of this drug has been delayed because of its possible side effects, and due to insufficient studies on adverse reactions in humans. There have been no studies investigating its effect on hearing. Thirty guinea pigs were divided into three groups: a control group, a halofantrine therapeutic dose group and a halofantrine double therapeutic dose group. One cochlea specimen from each animal was stained with haematoxylin and eosin and the other with toluidine blue. No changes were detected in the control group. The halofantrine therapeutic dose group showed loss and distortion of inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells, and loss of spiral ganglia cells. In the halofantrine double therapeutic dose group, the inner and outer hair cells were distorted and there was loss of spiral ganglia cells. answer: Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.	yes
question: Identification of racial disparities in breast cancer mortality: does scale matter? context: This paper investigates the impact of geographic scale (census tract, zip code, and county) on the detection of disparities in breast cancer mortality among three ethnic groups in Texas (period 1995-2005). Racial disparities were quantified using both relative (RR) and absolute (RD) statistics that account for the population size and correct for unreliable rates typically observed for minority groups and smaller geographic units. Results were then correlated with socio-economic status measured by the percentage of habitants living below the poverty level. African-American and Hispanic women generally experience higher mortality than White non-Hispanics, and these differences are especially significant in the southeast metropolitan areas and southwest border of Texas. The proportion and location of significant racial disparities however changed depending on the type of statistic (RR versus RD) and the geographic level. The largest proportion of significant results was observed for the RD statistic and census tract data. Geographic regions with significant racial disparities for African-Americans and Hispanics frequently had a poverty rate above 10.00%. answer: This study investigates both relative and absolute racial disparities in breast cancer mortality between White non-Hispanic and African-American/Hispanic women at the census tract, zip code and county levels. Analysis at the census tract level generally led to a larger proportion of geographical units experiencing significantly higher mortality rates for minority groups, although results varied depending on the use of the relative versus absolute statistics. Additional research is needed before general conclusions can be formulated regarding the choice of optimal geographic regions for the detection of racial disparities.	yes
question: Can fractional lasers enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model? context: It has been shown in vitro that pretreatment of skin with fractional lasers enhances transdermal delivery of drugs. The aim of this study is to demonstrate in vivo firstly that laser enhances transdermal drug absorption and secondly that this can be manipulated by altering laser settings.STUDY DESIGN/ Four pigs were used in the IACUC approved animal study. On day 0, 5 g of 4% topical lidocaine was applied under occlusion for 60 minutes to a 400 cm(2) area on the abdomen. Blood was drawn at 0, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. On day 7, the Er:YAG laser was used at 500, 250, 50, and 25 µm ablative depth, respectively, over a 400 cm(2) area on the abdomen. Five grams of 4% topical lidocaine was applied immediately with occlusion for 60 minutes, and then removed. Blood was drawn at 0, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. The serum was extracted and analyzed for lidocaine and its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX). Serum levels of lidocaine and MEGX were undetectable in untreated skin. Following laser treatment both lidocaine and MEGX were detectable. Peak levels of lidocaine were significantly higher (P = 0.0002) at 250 µm (0.62 mg/L), compared to 500 µm (0.45 mg/L), 50 µm (0.48 mg/L), and 25 µm (0.3 mg/L). Peak levels of MEGX were significantly higher (P ≤ 0.0001) at 250 µm (0.048 mg/L), compared to 500 µm (0.018 mg/L), 50 µm (0.036 mg/L), and 25 µm (0.0144 mg/L). answer: This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.	yes
question: Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery? context: Atrial fibrillation, which occurs in 12% of all major foregut surgeries, can prolong hospital stay and increase morbidity. Minimally invasive techniques in foregut surgery have been suggested to cause less tissue trauma. We examined the factors associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery at our institution. We retrospectively examined the records of 154 adult patients who underwent major foregut surgery which included esophagectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, redo Heller myotomy, redo or transthoracic fundoplications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with standard modeling techniques were performed to determine risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Of the 154 patients, 14 patients developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with a higher mean age of 67.1 years (+/-8.8 years) versus 56.4 years (+/-14.1 years) (p = 0.006). Laparoscopic (p = 0.004) and nonthoracic surgeries (p = 0.01) were associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation had received more fluid (6.5 +/- 2.8 liters versus 5.3 +/- 2.0 liters) and had longer operations (370 +/- 103 min versus 362 +/- 142 min), none of which were statistically significant. The average intensive care length of stay of patients was longer: 7.5 +/- 6.8 days versus 4.0 +/- 7.1 days (p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed an association of atrial fibrillation with age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14, p = 0.01), and laparoscopic surgery (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.95, p = 0.04) after adjusting for surgery type. answer: Laparoscopic surgery is associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation in foregut surgery. Development of atrial fibrillation is associated with increased length of intensive care stay. We recommend a prospective trial to confirm our findings.	yes
question: Is breast cancer survival improving? context: Despite advances in therapies for breast cancer, improvement in survival for patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer has been difficult to establish. The objective of the current study was to determine whether the survival of women with recurrent breast cancer has improved from 1974 to 2000. The authors analyzed the survival experience of 834 women who developed recurrent breast cancer between November 1974 and December 2000. All patients had been treated previously with adjuvant anthracycline-based protocols. Patients were divided into five consecutive groups based on year of breast cancer recurrence, and survival was compared across the five groups. Because some prognostic variables were divided unevenly divided among the cohorts, a multivariate model was created to determine the association of year of recurrence and survival after accounting for other prognostic factors. In the unadjusted analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival across the five groups, and the more recent cohorts had longer survival (P<0.001). Other variables that predicted longer survival after breast cancer recurrence included smaller initial tumor size, lower stage of disease, fewer lymph nodes involved, longer disease-free interval, estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and nonvisceral dominant site of disease recurrence. In the multivariate analysis, which adjusted for these prognostic factors, year of recurrence was associated with a trend toward improved survival, with a 1% reduction in risk for each increasing year. answer: For these cohorts of patients, the authors present data suggesting that the prognosis for patients with recurrent breast cancer improved between 1974 and 2000.	yes
question: Does partial expander deflation exacerbate the adverse effects of radiotherapy in two-stage breast reconstruction? context: The optimum protocol for expander volume adjustment with respect to the timing and application of radiotherapy remains controversial. Eighteen New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups. Metallic port integrated anatomic breast expanders of 250 cc were implanted on the back of each animal and controlled expansion was performed. Group I underwent radiotherapy with full expanders while in Group II, expanders were partially deflated immediately prior to radiotherapy. Control group did not receive radiotherapy.The changes in blood flow at different volume adjustments were investigated in Group II by laser Doppler flowmetry. Variations in the histopathologic properties of the irradiated tissues including the skin, capsule and the pocket floor, were compared in the biopsy specimens taken from different locations in each group. A significant increase in skin blood flow was detected in Group II with partial expander deflation. Overall, histopathologic exam revealed aggravated findings of chronic radiodermatitis (epidermal atrophy, dermal inflammation and fibrosis, neovascularisation and vascular changes as well as increased capsule thickness) especially around the lower expander pole, in Group II. answer: Expander deflation immediately prior to radiotherapy, may augment the adverse effects, especially in the lower expander pole, possibly via enhanced radiosensitization due to a relative increase in the blood flow and tissue oxygenation.	yes
question: Does the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth predict risk in a subsequent pregnancy? context: The objective of the study was to determine whether risk of recurrent preterm birth differs based on the clinical presentation of a prior spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB): advanced cervical dilatation (ACD), preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), or preterm labor (PTL). This retrospective cohort study included singleton pregnancies from 2009 to 2014 complicated by a history of prior SPTB. Women were categorized based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm delivery as having ACD, PPROM, or PTL. Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth. Log-linear regression was used to control for confounders. Of 522 patients included in this study, 96 (18.4%) had prior ACD, 246 (47.1%) had prior PPROM, and 180 (34.5%) had prior PTL. Recurrent PTB occurred in 55.2% of patients with a history of ACD compared with 27.2% of those with PPROM and 32.2% with PTL (P = .001). The mean gestational age at delivery was significantly lower for those with a history of ACD (34.0 weeks) compared with women with prior PPROM (37.2 weeks) or PTL (37.0 weeks) (P = .001). The lowest mean cervical length prior to 24 weeks was significantly shorter in patients with a history of advanced cervical dilation when compared with the other clinical presentations. answer: Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.	yes
question: Cold preparation use in young children after FDA warnings: do concerns still exist? context: To characterize the use and delivery of cough and cold medicines in children younger than 6 presenting to an inner-city pediatric emergency department (PED) following 2007 FDA warnings. A cross-sectional observational study was performed using a convenience sampling of PED patients during the fall of 2010. Caregivers were presented with 6 commonly used cough medicine preparations and were asked to demonstrate if and how they would administer these to their children. In all, 65 patients and their caregivers consented and participated in the study. During the demonstration, 82% (53/65) stated that they would treat with cough or cold medicines, and 72% (38/53) incorrectly dosed the medication they desired to give. answer: Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.	yes
question: Does occupational nuclear power plant radiation affect conception and pregnancy? context: To determine the effect of occupational exposure in a nuclear power plant in Griefswald, Germany on male and female fecundity. The frequency of men and women exposed to ionizing radiation through work in a nuclear power plant among 270 infertile couples was retrospectively compared to a control fertile population using a pair-matched analysis. The total cumulative equivalent radiation dose was determined. In addition, the spermiograms of the male partners in both groups were compared and correlated to the degree of exposure. No differences were noted in the frequency of nuclear power plant exposure between sterile and fertile groups. There was a higher rate of anomalous spermiograms in nuclear power plant workers. However, abnormalities were temporary. No correlation was found between the cumulative equivalent radiation dose and abnormal spermiograms. answer: The data suggest that occupational exposure due to ionizing radiation should be investigated as a possible cause for involuntary temporary sterility and as a risk factor for early pregnancy disorders.	yes
question: Can shape analysis differentiate free-floating internal carotid artery thrombus from atherosclerotic plaque in patients evaluated with CTA for stroke or transient ischemic attack? context: Patients presenting with transient ischemic attack or stroke may have symptom-related lesions on acute computed tomography angiography (CTA) such as free-floating intraluminal thrombus (FFT). It is difficult to distinguish FFT from carotid plaque, but the distinction is critical as management differs. By contouring the shape of these vascular lesions ("virtual endarterectomy"), advanced morphometric analysis can be performed. The objective of our study is to determine whether quantitative shape analysis can accurately differentiate FFT from atherosclerotic plaque. We collected 23 consecutive cases of suspected carotid FFT seen on CTA (13 men, 65 ± 10 years; 10 women, 65.5 ± 8.8 years). True-positive FFT cases (FFT+) were defined as filling defects resolving with anticoagulant therapy versus false-positives (FFT-), which remained unchanged. Lesion volumes were extracted from CTA images and quantitative shape descriptors were computed. The five most discriminative features were used to construct receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and to generate three machine-learning classifiers. Average classification accuracy was determined by cross-validation. Follow-up imaging confirmed sixteen FFT+ and seven FFT- cases. Five shape descriptors delineated FFT+ from FFT- cases. The logistic regression model produced from combining all five shape features demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 71.4% with an area under the ROC curve = 0.85 ± 0.09. Average accuracy for each classifier ranged from 65.2%-76.4%. answer: We identified five quantitative shape descriptors of carotid FFT. This shape "signature" shows potential for supplementing conventional lesion characterization in cases of suspected FFT.	yes
question: Can pictorial warning labels on cigarette packages address smoking-related health disparities? context: The objective of this study was to determine the most effective content of pictorial health warning labels (HWLs) and whether educational attainment moderates these effects. Field experiments were conducted with 529 adult smokers and 530 young adults (258 nonsmokers; 271 smokers). Participants reported responses to different pictorial HWLs printed on cigarette packages. One experiment involved manipulating textual form (testimonial narrative vs. didactic) and the other involved manipulating image type (diseased organs vs. human suffering). Tests of mean ratings and rankings indicated that pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms had equivalent or significantly higher credibility, relevance, and impact than pictorial HWLs with testimonial forms. Results from mixed-effects models confirmed these results. However, responses differed by participant educational attainment: didactic forms were consistently rated higher than testimonials among participants with higher education, whereas the difference between didactic and testimonial narrative forms was weaker or not statistically significant among participants with lower education. In the second experiment, with textual content held constant, greater credibility, relevance, and impact was found for graphic imagery of diseased organs than imagery of human suffering. answer: Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.	yes
question: Surgical treatment of prosthetic valve endocarditis in patients with double prostheses: is single-valve replacement safe? context: Bias against operating on patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) who have multiple prostheses may preclude the use of life-saving valve replacement. We investigated the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of PVE in patients with both mitral and aortic prosthesis and the safety of single-valve replacement when only one valve seemed infected. Patients with a diagnosis of active PVE who had mitral and aortic prosthesis in place were assessed. We looked at the methods for diagnosis, causative agents, indication for valve replacement, operative findings and outcome. Twenty patients, who had both mitral and aortic prostheses and a diagnosis of PVE, were assessed. Streptococci and staphylococci caused 70% of cases. By means of echocardiography, the valves involved were: mitral (11 patients), aortic (six patients), and in three cases both prosthetic valves seemed infected. Surgery was undertaken in 17 patients (85%). The positive predictive value of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for the preoperative diagnosis of the site of infection was 100%. In 13 patients, only the prosthetic valve that seemed infected was replaced. Four of these patients died within a week after the procedure. Nine patients survived the surgical procedure, completed a course of antimicrobial therapy and were followed up for 15.78 months (95% CI: 12.83-18.72). All were considered cured and relapses were not observed. answer: TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.	yes
question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR? context: To examine the ability of various postoperative nomograms to predict prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and to validate that they could predict aggressive biochemical recurrence (BCR). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), grade, and stage are the classic triad used to predict BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP). Multiple nomograms use these to predict risk of BCR. A previous study showed that several nomograms could predict aggressive BCR (prostate-specific antigen doubling time [PSADT] <9 months) more accurately than BCR. However, it remains unknown if they can predict more definitive endpoints, such as PCSM. We performed Cox analyses to examine the ability of 4 postoperative nomograms, the Duke Prostate Center (DPC) nomogram, the Kattan postoperative nomogram, the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) nomogram, and the joint Center for Prostate Disease Research(CPDR)/Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) nomogram to predict BCR and PCSM among 1778 men in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database who underwent RP between 1990 and 2009. We also compared their ability to predict BCR and aggressive BCR in a subset of men. We calculated the c-index for each nomogram to determine its predictive accuracy for estimating actual outcomes. We found that each nomogram could predict aggressive BCR and PCSM in a statistically significant manner and that they all predicted PCSM more accurately than they predicted BCR (ie, with higher c-index values). answer: Currently available nomograms used to predict BCR accurately predict PCSM and other more clinically relevant endpoints. Moreover, not only do they significantly predict PCSM, but do so with generally greater accuracy than BCR.	yes
question: Do "America's Best Hospitals" perform better for acute myocardial infarction? context: "America's Best Hospitals," an influential list published annually by U.S. News and World Report, assesses the quality of hospitals. It is not known whether patients admitted to hospitals ranked at the top in cardiology have lower short-term mortality from acute myocardial infarction than those admitted to other hospitals or whether differences in mortality are explained by differential use of recommended therapies. Using data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project on 149,177 elderly Medicare beneficiaries with acute myocardial infarction in 1994 or 1995, we examined the care and outcomes of patients admitted to three types of hospitals: those ranked high in cardiology (top-ranked hospitals); hospitals not in the top rank that had on-site facilities for cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty, and bypass surgery (similarly equipped hospitals); and the remaining hospitals (non-similarly equipped hospitals). We compared 30-day mortality; the rates of use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and reperfusion; and the relation of differences in rates of therapy to short-term mortality. Admission to a top-ranked hospital was associated with lower adjusted 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.00; P=0.05 for top-ranked hospitals vs. the others). Among patients without contraindications to therapy, top-ranked hospitals had significantly higher rates of use of aspirin (96.2 percent, as compared with 88.6 percent for similarly equipped hospitals and 83.4 percent for non-similarly equipped hospitals; P<0.01) and beta-blockers (75.0 percent vs. 61.8 percent and 58.7 percent, P<0.01), but lower rates of reperfusion therapy (61.0 percent vs. 70.7 percent and 65.6 percent, P=0.03). The survival advantage associated with admission to top-ranked hospitals was less strong after we adjusted for factors including the use of aspirin and beta-blockers (odds ratio, 0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.08; P=0.38). answer: Admission to a hospital ranked high on the list of "America's Best Hospitals" was associated with lower 30-day mortality among elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction. A substantial portion of the survival advantage may be associated with these hospitals' higher rates of use of aspirin and beta-blocker therapy.	yes
question: Do socioeconomic differences in mortality persist after retirement? context: To assess the risk of death associated with work based and non-work based measures of socioeconomic status before and after retirement age. Follow up study of mortality in relation to employment grade and car ownership over 25 years. The first Whitehall study. 18,133 male civil servants aged 40-69 years who attended a screening examination between 1967 and 1970. Death. Grade of employment was a strong predictor of mortality before retirement. For men dying at ages 40-64 the lowest employment grade had 3.12 times the mortality of the highest grade (95% confidence interval 2.4 to 4.1). After retirement the ability of grade to predict mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal magnitude after retirement. The absolute difference in death rates between the lowest and highest employment grades increased with age from 12.9 per 1000 person years at ages 40-64 to 38.3 per 1000 at ages 70-89. answer: Socioeconomic differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and in magnitude increase with age. Social differentials in mortality based on an occupational status measure seem to decrease to a greater degree after retirement than those based on a non-work measure. This suggests that alongside other socioeconomic factors work itself may play an important part in generating social inequalities in health in men of working age.	yes
question: Convulsions and retinal haemorrhage: should we look further? context: The prevalence of retinal haemorrhages after convulsions is not well established. As these haemorrhages are considered characteristic of child abuse, we investigated their occurrence after convulsive episodes to see whether the finding of haemorrhage should prompt further investigation. Prospective study of 153 children (aged 2 months to 2 years), seen in the emergency department after a convulsive episode. After a thorough history and physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. If findings were positive, further investigation was undertaken to rule out systemic disorder or child abuse. One child was found with unilateral retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding. answer: Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.	yes
question: Is the use of cyanoacrylate in intestinal anastomosis a good and reliable alternative? context: The present study aims to compare strength, healing, and operation time of experimental intestinal anastomoses performed by polyglactin 910 (Vicryl; Ethicon, Edinburgh, United Kingdom) sutures with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue (Pattex; Henkel, Dusseldorf, Germany). Ninety-six Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 (groups E and L). Each group was further subdivided into 6 subgroups (EA1, EA2, EA3, EB1, EB2, EB3, LA1, LA2, LA3, LB1, LB2, LB3), each containing 8 rats. Intestinal anastomosis was performed by polyglactin 910 sutures in A subgroups and with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate in B subgroups. The anastomosis was end to end in A1 and B1, side to side in A2 and B2, and end to side in A3 and B3. Time for anastomosis performance (AT) was recorded. In group E, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were determined on the second postoperative day, whereas in group L, the same measurements were made on the sixth postoperative day. One-way analysis of variance was used for analyses of variance in the groups. Quantitative data were analyzed with Student's t test. P value was considered significant at less than .05. There was no significant difference between bursting pressures of subgroup pairs on both postoperative days 2 and 6. Hydroxyproline levels and AT were significantly better in B subgroups. answer: Better healing, shorter AT, and equal strength were achieved with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate compared with polyglactin 910 sutures in intestinal anastomosis in the experimental setting.	yes
question: Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males? context: To provide insight into the factors by which obesity in itself may directly lead to early arterial damage, we aimed to determine early sonographic markers of obesity-related vascular dysfunction in young obese males. Thirty-five young obese males and 23 age-matched healthy male volunteers were recruited into the study. Common carotid artery pulsatility index and resistance index were calculated from blood flow velocities curves obtained by pulsed Doppler ultrasonography. The mean pulsatility index, resistance index, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, plasma fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were statistically higher in obese subjects than in healthy controls. answer: Our results suggest that depressed vessel compliance and increased vascular resistance are features of young, obese, normotensive subjects independently of and in addition to cardiovascular risk factors. As changes in arterial wall properties may be incipient in young obese subjects, future studies will be required to demonstrate whether early intervention such as diet and exercise in this population can improve vascular functions.	yes
question: Does topical ropivacaine reduce the post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients? context: To determine whether post-operative administration of topical ropivacaine hydrochloride decreases morbidity following adenotonsillectomy. Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. University referral center; ENT Department. Fourty one children, aged 4-16 years, undergoing tonsillectomy. Patients received 1.0% ropivacaine hydrochloride soaked swabs packed in their tonsillar fossae while the control group received saline-soaked swabs. Mc Grath's face scale was used to compare the two groups in respect of pain control. Chi-square and two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney-U-tests were used to compare the two independent groups. As 10 we made 11 comparison between groups, for Bonferroni correction, p<0.005 was accepted as statistically significant. Only first hour there was no significant pain-relieving effect seen in the ropivacaine group (p>0.05). The other hours and days there were statistically significance between the two groups (p<0.001). Also, the other post-operative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia and trismus were not statistically different between the two groups. There were no complications associated with ropivacaine hydrochloride. No patients in this study suffered systemic side effects related to the use of this medication. answer: Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.	yes
question: Is robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy? context: To evaluate whether robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is less invasive than radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP), as experimental studies suggest that the acute phase reaction is proportional to surgery-induced tissue damage. Between May and November 2006, all patients undergoing RRP or RALP in our department were prospectively assessed. Blood samples were collected 24 h before (T0), during surgery (T1), at the end of anaesthesia (T2), and 12 (T3) and 24 h after surgery (T4), and assayed for interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-1 alpha, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate. The Mann-Whitney U-, Student's t- and Friedman tests were used to compare continuous variables, and the Pearson chi-square and Fisher test for categorical variables, with a two-sided P<0.05 considered to indicate significance. In all, 35 and 26 patients were assessed for RALP and RRP, respectively; the median (interquartile range) age was 62 (56-68) and 68.5 (59.2-71.2) years, respectively (P<0.009). Baseline levels (T0) of IL-1, IL-6, CRP and lactate were comparable in both arms. IL-6, CRP and lactates levels increased during both kinds of surgery. The mean IL-6 and CPR values were higher for RRP at T1 (P = 0.01 and 0.001), T2 (P = 0.001 and<0.001), T3 (P = 0.002 and<0.001) and T4 (P<0.001 and 0.02), respectively. Lactate was higher for RRP at T2 (P = 0.001), T3 (P = 0.001) and T4 (P = 0.004), although remaining within the normal ranges. IL-1 alpha did not change at the different sample times. answer: This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.	yes
question: Is specialty care associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure? context: Implementation of the complex treatment strategies that have been shown to improve survival of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) may require certain expertise. We wanted to examine the association between pattern of outpatient care and survival of patients with CHF. In a retrospective cohort study conducted with national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) databases, we examined the association between the pattern of outpatient care and survival in 11,661 patients discharged from VA hospitals between October 1, 1991, and September 30, 1992, with the primary diagnosis of CHF (cohort 1). Patients were divided into 4 groups, on the basis of their pattern of outpatient care over a 12-month period after discharge: 1) general medicine clinic visits only (GM-only); 2) cardiology clinic visits only (CARD-only); 3) general medicine and cardiology (MIXED) clinic visits; and 4) neither general medicine nor cardiology clinic visits (no-GM/CARD). We used the Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate 1-year survival, controlling for clinical and demographic factors. Consistency of our results was examined by performing identical analysis on a cohort of patients discharged from VHA hospitals between October 1, 1994, and September 30, 1995 (cohort 2, n = 10,141). The overall 1-year mortality rate was 23% in the primary cohort. The unadjusted mortality rate was highest for patients in the no-GM/CARD follow up (29%) and lowest for patients in the MIXED group (19%). By use of the MIXED group as reference and adjusting for important clinical and demographic factors, the risk of death (risk ratio [95% CI]) was 1.12 (0.94-1.34) in the CARD-only group, 1.26 (1.15-1.38) in the GM-only group, and 1.48 (1.28-1.72) in the no-GM/CARD group. Cohort-2 results were consistent with cohort 1 for most covariates, and significant survival differences were again found between GM-only and the MIXED group (1.25 [1.14-1.37]). answer: We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.	yes
question: Histologic evaluation of the testicular remnant associated with the vanishing testes syndrome: is surgical management necessary? context: There is controversy surrounding the optimal management of the testicular remnant associated with the vanishing testes syndrome. Some urologists advocate the need for surgical exploration, whereas others believe this is unnecessary. These differing opinions are based on the variable reports of viable germ cell elements found within the testicular remnants. To better understand the pathology associated with this syndrome and the need for surgical management, we reviewed our experience regarding the incidence of viable germ cell elements within the testicular remnant. An institutional review board-approved, retrospective review was performed of all consecutive patients undergoing exploration for a nonpalpable testis at Eastern Virginia Medical School and Geisinger Medical Center between 1994 and 2006. Patients who were found to have spermatic vessels and a vas deferens exiting a closed internal inguinal ring were included in this analysis. Fifty-six patients underwent removal of the testicular remnant. Patient age ranged from 11 to 216 months. In 8 of the specimens (14%), we identified viable germ cell elements. In an additional 4 patients (7%), we identified seminiferous tubules without germ cell elements. answer: In our review, we identified that a significant number of testicular remnants associated with the vanishing testes syndrome can harbor viable germ cell elements or seminiferous tubules. The exact fate of these residual elements remains unknown; however, there may exist the potential for malignant transformation. Given the potential for malignant degeneration, we believe that these remnants should be removed.	yes
question: Does oxybutynin hydrochloride cause arrhythmia in children with bladder dysfunction? context: This study represents a subset of a complete data set, considering only those children aged admitted to the Pediatric Surgery and Pediatric Nephrology Clinics during the period January 2011 to July 2012. In this study, we have determined that the QT interval changes significantly depending on the use of oxybutynin. The QT changes increased cardiac arrhythmia in children. answer: For this reason, children using such drugs should be closely monitored for cardiac arrhythmia.	yes
question: Does the manic/mixed episode distinction in bipolar disorder patients run true over time? context: The authors sought to determine whether the manic/mixed episode distinction in patients with bipolar disorder runs true over time. Over an 11-year period, the observed distribution of manic and mixed episodes (N=1,224) for patients with three or more entries in the management information system of a community mental health center (N=241) was compared to the expected distribution determined by averaging 1,000 randomly generated simulations. Episodes were consistent (all manic or all mixed) in significantly more patients than would be expected by chance. answer: These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.	yes
question: Is the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia a prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcome? context: The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and how it relates to other prognostic factors. We performed a retrospective cohort study from December 2009 to February 2012 with analysis of demographic, clinical and biochemical data from two obstetric day assessment units in hospitals in Southeast Scotland. We included 717 pregnant women, with singleton pregnancies after 20 weeks' gestation, referred for evaluation of suspected preeclampsia and having their first ACR performed. The ability of ACR to predict future outcomes was assessed in both univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. The latter assessed its prognostic value independent of (adjusting for) existing prognostic factors. Primary outcome measures were maternal and neonatal composite adverse outcomes, and a secondary outcome was gestation at delivery. In all, 204 women (28.5%) experienced a composite adverse maternal outcome and 146 women (20.4%) experienced a composite adverse neonatal outcome. Multivariate analysis of log-transformed ACR demonstrated that a 1-unit increase in log ACR is associated with an increased odds of adverse maternal [odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-1.80] and adverse neonatal (odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.29) composite outcomes, and with reduced gestational age at delivery (coefficient: -0.46, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.38). answer: ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.	yes
question: Are pediatric concussion patients compliant with discharge instructions? context: Concussions are commonly diagnosed in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate compliance with ED discharge instructions for concussion management. A prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2011 to November 2012 in a pediatric ED at a regional Level 1 trauma center, serving 35,000 pediatric patients per year. Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or preexisting neurologic condition. Subjects were administered a baseline survey in the ED and were given standardized discharge instructions for concussion by the treating physician. Telephone follow-up surveys were conducted at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ED visit. A total of 150 patients were enrolled. The majority (67%) of concussions were sports related. Among sports-related concussions, soccer (30%), football (11%), lacrosse (8%), and basketball (8%) injuries were most common. More than one third (39%) reported return to play (RTP) on the day of the injury. Physician follow-up was equivalent for sport and nonsport concussions (2 weeks, 58%; 4 weeks, 64%). Sports-related concussion patients were more likely to follow up with a trainer (2 weeks, 25% vs. 10%, p = 0.06; 4 weeks, 29% vs. 8%, p<0.01). Of the patients who did RTP or normal activities at 2 weeks (44%), more than one third (35%) were symptomatic, and most (58%) did not receive medical clearance. Of the patients who had returned to activities at 4 weeks (64%), less than one quarter (23%) were symptomatic, and most (54%) received medical clearance. answer: Pediatric patients discharged from the ED are mostly compliant with concussion instructions. However, a significant number of patients RTP on the day of injury, while experiencing symptoms or without medical clearance.	yes
question: Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught? context: Communication with terminally ill patients is a main responsibility of physicians. However, many physicians feel insufficiently prepared for this task. Models of courses resulting in improvements of communicative skills of participants have been published mainly in the Anglo-American literature. This study describes the realization of a 2-day course model based on the experiences of the first three courses of this kind in Rhineland-Palatinate, and analyzes changes of participants' communication behavior. After each seminary, an evaluation form concerning participants' satisfaction with the course was filled in. Furthermore, all course participants received a questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the course, as well as 3 months afterwards. The participants were asked to assess their own sense of security in seven different communication settings on a visual analog scale, and to specify perceived changes in their communication behavior 3 months after the course. The first three courses were attended by 31 participants. Course evaluation revealed high satisfaction scores with methods as well as with clarity and relevance of the contents. Self-assessment of participants showed a growing sense of security in different communication settings. Important increases could be demonstrated for communicating a diagnosis of cancer with good or less good prognosis, recurrence of cancer or a far progressive cancer disease without curative approach. 3 months after the course, participants described multiple changes indicating increased sensibility and professionalism in communication behavior. answer: The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.	yes
question: Are environmental factors important in primary systemic vasculitis? context: To investigate the association between primary systemic vasculitis (PSV) and environmental risk factors. Seventy-five PSV cases and 273 controls (220 nonvasculitis, 19 secondary vasculitis, and 34 asthma controls) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Factors investigated were social class, occupational and residential history, smoking, pets, allergies, vaccinations, medications, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and farm exposure in the year before symptom onset (index year). The Standard Occupational Classification 2000 and job-exposure matrices were used to assess occupational silica, solvent, and metal exposure. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) adjusted for potential confounders. Total PSV, subgroups (47 Wegener's granulomatosis [WG], 12 microscopic polyangiitis, 16 Churg-Strauss syndrome [CSS]), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive cases were compared with control groups. Farming in the index year was significantly associated with PSV (OR 2.3 [95% CI 1.2-4.6]), with WG (2.7 [1.2-5.8]), with MPA (6.3 [1.9-21.6]), and with perinuclear ANCA (pANCA) (4.3 [1.5-12.7]). Farming during working lifetime was associated with PSV (2.2 [1.2-3.8]) and with WG (2.7 [1.3-5.7]). Significant associations were found for high occupational silica exposure in the index year (with PSV 3.0 [1.0-8.4], with CSS 5.6 [1.3-23.5], and with ANCA 4.9 [1.3-18.6]), high occupational solvent exposure in the index year (with PSV 3.4 [0.9-12.5], with WG 4.8 [1.2-19.8], and with classic ANCA [cANCA] 3.9 [1.6-9.5]), high occupational solvent exposure during working lifetime (with PSV 2.7 [1.1-6.6], with WG 3.4 [1.3-8.9], and with cANCA 3.3 [1.0-10.8]), drug allergy (with PSV 3.6 [1.8-7.0], with WG 4.0 [1.8-8.7], and with cANCA 4.7 [1.9-11.7]), and allergy overall (with PSV 2.2 [1.2-3.9], with WG 2.7 [1.4-5.7]). No other significant associations were found. answer: A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.	yes
question: Diagnosis and follow-up in constipated children: should we use ultrasound? context: We investigated the efficacy of ultrasound in determining megarectum and fecal load and the response to treatment in constipation and tried to specify objective criteria in this study. A total of 66 cases were queried and divided into 2 groups as constipated (n = 35; mean age, 6.8 ± 2.9 years) and control (n = 31; mean age, 8.4 ± 3.8 years) according to Rome III criteria. After the clinical evaluation, pelvic ultrasonography (US) was performed by 2 separate radiologists. The bladder capacity and the transverse rectal diameter were measured with a full bladder. Then the rectal diameter and rectal anterior wall thickness were measured, and the presence of fecal load in the rectum and sigmoid colon was recorded with an empty bladder. The examination and ultrasound were repeated after treatment for a month in these patients. Comparison of the US measurements of the 2 radiologists performing the US tests did not show any interobserver difference (r = 0.981; P<.001). We therefore believe our results are objective and reproducible. We found a positive correlation between the rectal diameters and the age, height, weight, and bladder capacity. The posturination mean rectal diameter was thicker in the constipated group (3.02 ± 1.04 cm) than in the control group (1.98 ± 0.64 cm) (P<.001). The cutoff point of rectal diameter for a diagnosis of constipation was determined as 2.44 cm (71% sensitive; 76% specific; area under curve, 0.825; P<.001). The rectal anterior wall thickness and fecal load were higher in the constipated patients (P<.001). There was a significant decrease in the constipation score and fecal load after treatment for a month (P<.001), but the rectal diameter had not reached normal limits yet despite the decrease (2.71 ± 0.77 cm) (P>.05). answer: The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.	yes
question: Out of the smokescreen II: will an advertisement targeting the tobacco industry affect young people's perception of smoking in movies and their intention to smoke? context: To evaluate the effect of an antismoking advertisement on young people's perceptions of smoking in movies and their intention to smoke.SUBJECTS/ 3091 cinema patrons aged 12-24 years in three Australian states; 18.6% of the sample (n = 575) were current smokers.DESIGN/ Quasi-experimental study of patrons, surveyed after having viewed a movie. The control group was surveyed in week 1, and the intervention group in weeks 2 and 3. Before seeing the movie in weeks 2 and 3, a 30 s antismoking advertisement was shown, shot in the style of a movie trailer that warned patrons not to be sucked in by the smoking in the movie they were about to see. Attitude of current smokers and non-smokers to smoking in the movies; intention of current smokers and non-smokers to smoke in 12 months. Among non-smokers, 47.8% of the intervention subjects thought that the smoking in the viewed movie was not OK compared with 43.8% of the control subjects (p = 0.04). However, there was no significant difference among smokers in the intervention (16.5%) and control (14.5%) groups (p = 0.4). A higher percentage of smokers in the intervention group indicated that they were likely to be smoking in 12 months time (38.6%) than smokers in the control group (25.6%; p<0.001). For non-smokers, there was no significant difference in smoking intentions between groups, with 1.2% of intervention subjects and 1.6% of controls saying that they would probably be smoking in 12 months time (p = 0.54). answer: This real-world study suggests that placing an antismoking advertisement before movies containing smoking scenes can help to immunise non-smokers against the influences of film stars' smoking. Caution must be exercised in the type of advertisement screened as some types of advertising may reinforce smokers' intentions to smoke.	yes
question: Do general practitioner hospitals reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds? context: To assess whether populations with access to general practitioner hospitals (GP hospitals) utilise general hospitals less than populations without such access. Observational study comparing the total rates of admissions and of occupied bed days in general hospitals between populations with and without access to GP hospitals. Comparisons were also made separately for diagnoses commonly encountered in GP hospitals. Two general hospitals serving the population of Finnmark county in north Norway. 35,435 admissions based on five years' routine recordings from the two hospitals. The total rate of admission to general hospitals was lower in peripheral municipalities with a GP hospital than in central municipalities without this kind of institution, 26% and 28% lower for men and women respectively. The corresponding differences were 38% and 52%, when analysed for occupied bed days. The differences were most pronounced for patients with respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, and cancer who are primarily or intermediately treated or cared for in GP hospitals, and for patients with stroke and fractures, who are regularly transferred from general hospitals to GP hospitals for longer term follow up care. answer: GP hospitals seem to reduce the utilisation of general hospitals with respect to admissions as well as occupied bed days.	yes
question: Does insulin resistance drive the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk? context: Several studies have shown associations between hyperglycemia and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, yet glucose-lowering treatment does little to mitigate this risk. We examined whether associations between hyperglycemia and CVD risk were explained by underlying insulin resistance. In 60 middle-aged individuals without diabetes we studied the associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour post oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity as well as body fat percentage with CVD risk. Insulin sensitivity was measured as the glucose infusion rate during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, body fat percentage was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry, and CVD risk was estimated using the Framingham risk score. Associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity and body fat percentage with the Framingham risk score were assessed in linear regression models. Both fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose levels were associated with higher Framingham risk score (fasting glucose: r(2) = 0.21; 2-hour glucose: r(2) = 0.24; P<0.001 for both), and insulin sensitivity with lower Framingham risk score (r(2) = 0.36; P<0.001). However, adjustment for insulin sensitivity and 2-hour glucose made the effect of fasting glucose non-significant (P = 0.060). Likewise, when adjusting for insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose, the association between 2-hour glucose and Framingham risk score disappeared (P = 0.143). In contrast, insulin sensitivity was still associated with Framingham risk score after adjusting for glucose levels (P<0.001). Body fat was not associated with Framingham risk score when taking insulin sensitivity into account (P = 0.550). answer: The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.	yes
question: Ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria: are there different levels of risk for transition to psychosis? context: The ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria have been validated in a number of studies. However, it is not known whether particular UHR criteria (Attenuated Psychotic Symptoms (APS), Brief Limited Intermittent Psychotic Symptoms (BLIPS) or Trait vulnerability criteria), or combination of criteria, is associated with a higher risk of transition to psychosis. The current study investigated this issue over a 6-month follow-up period. We hypothesised that the risk of transition would increase in the following order: Trait alone<APS alone<APS+Trait<BLIPS. Data on UHR intake criteria and transition to psychosis status at 6 months were analysed for UHR patients seen at the PACE clinic, Orygen Youth Health between January 2000 and November 2008. A total of 928 new referrals were accepted into the PACE clinic over this period of whom 817 (88%) had baseline information available for analysis. The percentage of subjects who presented with APS, Trait and BLIPS were 83%, 27% and 4%, respectively. When the two intermediate groups (APS alone and APS+Trait) were combined, there was evidence that the risk of transition increased in the order of Trait alone<APS<BLIPS (p=0.024, adjusted analysis). answer: Our data suggest that UHR intake criteria predict transition over 6 months in the order of Trait alone<APS<BLIPS. The fact that BLIPS patients are at the highest risk of transition over the short term is consistent with the "early" versus "late" prodrome model. It also indicates that particular clinical attention may need to be paid to BLIPS patients, especially early in the course of treatment.	yes
question: Aberrant loss of dickkopf-3 in gastric cancer: can it predict lymph node metastasis preoperatively? context: Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) may act as a tumor suppressor as it is down-regulated in various types of cancer. This study assessed the DKK3 protein expression in gastric cancer and its potential value as a prognostic marker. DKK3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 158 gastric cancer samples from patients who underwent gastrectomy from 2002 to 2008. Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed. Loss of DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated with advanced T stage (p<0.001), lymph node metastasis (p<0.001), UICC TNM stage (p<0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032). Patients without DKK3 expression in tumor cells had a significantly worse disease-free and overall survival than those with DKK3 expression (p<0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). TNM stage (p = 0.028 and p<0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p<0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients. answer: Loss of DKK3 protein expression was significantly associated with poor survival in patients with gastric cancer and was strongly correlated with the TNM stage. DKK3 might be a potential biomarker of lymph node involvement that can improve the predictive power of CT.	yes
question: Can CT predict the level of CSF block in tuberculous hydrocephalus? context: Treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus in children with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) depends on the level of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) block. Air-encephalography is regarded as the gold standard for differentiating communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus. Since air-encephalography involves a lumbar puncture, it carries the risk of cerebral herniation. AIM. The aim of this study was to determine whether communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus in TBM can be differentiated by means of cranial computerised tomography (CT). A number of CT indices were measured in 50 children with communicating and 34 children with non-communicating hydrocephalus according to air-encephalographic findings. The only CT finding that correlated with the type of hydrocephalus was the shape of the third ventricle. Significantly more children with non-communicating hydrocephalus had a rounded third ventricle than those with communicating hydrocephalus. answer: CT is therefore not useful in determining the level of CSF block in TBM. Air-encephalography remains the most reliable way of determining the level of CSF obstruction.	yes
question: Is oral endotracheal intubation efficacy impaired in the helicopter environment? context: Patients transported by helicopter often require advanced airway management. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not the in-flight environment of air medical transport in a BO-105 helicopter impairs the ability of flight nurses to perform oral endotracheal intubation. The study was conducted in an MBB BO-105 helicopter. Flight nurses performed three manikin intubations in each of the two study environments: on an emergency department stretcher and in-flight in the BO-105 helicopter. The mean time required for in-flight intubation (25.9 +/- 10.9 seconds) was significantly longer than the corresponding time (13.2 +/- 2.8 seconds) required for intubation in the control setting (ANOVA, F = 38.7, p<.001). All intubations performed in the control setting were placed correctly in the trachea; there were two (6.7%) esophageal intubations in the in-flight setting. The difference in appropriate endotracheal intubation between the two settings was not significant (chi 2 = 0.3; p>0.05). answer: Oral endotracheal intubation in the in-flight setting of the BO-105 helicopter takes approximately twice as long as intubation in a ground setting. The results support pre-flight intubation of patients who appear likely to require urgent intubation during air medical transport in the BO-105 helicopter.	yes
question: Sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure; can it improve sternal stability? context: Sternal instability with mediastinitis is a very serious complication after median sternotomy. Biomechanical studies have suggested superiority of rigid plate fixation over wire cerclage for sternal fixation. This study tests the hypothesis that sternal closure stability can be improved by adding plate fixation in a human cadaver model. Midline sternotomy was performed in 18 human cadavers. Four sternal closure techniques were tested: (1) approximation with six interrupted steel wires; (2) approximation with six interrupted cables; (3) closure 1 (wires) or 2 (cables) reinforced with a transverse sternal plate at the sixth rib; (4) Closure using 4 sternal plates alone. Intrathoracic pressure was increased in all techniques while sternal separation was measured by three pairs of sonomicrometry crystals fixed at the upper, middle and lower parts of the sternum until 2.0 mm separation was detected. Differences in displacement pressures were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and Regression Coefficients. Intrathoracic pressure required to cause 2.0 mm separation increased significantly from 183.3 +/- 123.9 to 301.4 +/- 204.5 in wires/cables alone vs. wires/cables plus one plate respectively, and to 355.0 +/- 210.4 in the 4 plates group (p<0.05). Regression Coefficients (95% CI) were 120 (47-194) and 142 (66-219) respectively for the plate groups. answer: Transverse sternal plating with 1 or 4 plates significantly improves sternal stability closure in human cadaver model. Adding a single sternal plate to primary closure improves the strength of sternal closure with traditional wiring potentially reducing the risk of sternal dehiscence and could be considered in high risk patients.	yes
question: Can early second-look tympanoplasty reduce the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy? context: The aims of the study were to report the rates of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma following primary CAT surgery and to report the rate of conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy. This was a retrospective review of a single surgeon series between 2006 and 2012. In total 132 second-look operations were undertaken, with a mean interval between primary surgery and second-look procedures of 6 months. The rate of cholesteatoma at second-look surgery was 19.7%, which was split into residual disease (10.6%) and recurrent disease (9.09%). New tympanic membrane defects with cholesteatoma were considered as recurrent disease. Residual disease was defined as cholesteatoma present behind an intact tympanic membrane. The majority of recurrent and residual disease was easily removed at second look (73.1%). Only four cases were converted to a modified radical mastoidectomy (3%) and three cases required a third-look procedure. answer: Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.	yes
question: Can T-cell deficiency affect spatial learning ability following toluene exposure? context: The present studywas designed to investigate the possible role of T cells in spatial learning ability in mouse after toluene exposure. Eight-week-old male wild-type (WT) and nude mice of BALB/c strain were exposed to toluene (0, 9 and 90 ppm) in a nose-only exposure chamber for 30 min per day for 3 consecutive days and then once per week for 4 weeks. Twenty-four hours after the completion of exposure, we examined the spatial learning ability in each mouse using the Morris water maze apparatus. In the acquisition phase, a longer escape latency was observed in nude mice exposed to 90 ppm toluene on days 3 and 4 when compared with corresponding WT mice. However, the effect of toluene on the escape latency was not significant in nude mice. In the probe trial, WT mice exposed to 90 ppm toluene showed poor retention memory compared with the control group. In the reversal phase, we did not find any significant difference between groups. answer: These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.	yes
question: Are acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older people socially imbalanced? context: Preventive home visits are offered to community dwelling older people in Denmark aimed at maintaining their functional ability for as long as possible, but only two thirds of older people accept the offer from the municipalities. The purpose of this study is to investigate 1) whether socioeconomic status was associated with acceptance of preventive home visits among older people and 2) whether municipality invitational procedures for the preventive home visits modified the association. The study population included 1,023 community dwelling 80-year-old individuals from the Danish intervention study on preventive home visits. Information on preventive home visit acceptance rates was obtained from questionnaires. Socioeconomic status was measured by financial assets obtained from national registry data, and invitational procedures were identified through the municipalities. Logistic regression analyses were used, adjusted by gender. Older persons with high financial assets accepted preventive home visits more frequently than persons with low assets (adjusted OR = 1.5 (CI95%: 1.1-2.0)). However, the association was attenuated when adjusted by the invitational procedures. The odds ratio for accepting preventive home visits was larger among persons with low financial assets invited by a letter with a proposed date than among persons with high financial assets invited by other procedures, though these estimates had wide confidence intervals. answer: High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.	yes
question: Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome? context: Neutrophil infiltration of the lung is characteristic of early posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS. Prospective observational study. University Hospital Wales, the Royal Gwent Hospital, and East Glamorgan General Hospital. Laboratory work was conducted at the Institute of Nephrology. Adult blunt trauma victims with Injury Severity Score>or = 18. Neutrophils were isolated from citrated blood from 17 adult blunt major trauma patients at admission (0 hrs) and 8 and 24 hrs later. Identical samples were obtained from normal laboratory volunteers (n = 9). The neutrophil count in each specimen was measured, and the number of neutrophils migrating across porous tissue culture inserts in response to defined concentrations of interleukin-8 (0, 10, 30, and 100 ng/mL) was quantitated by peroxidase assay. Neutrophil counts in the whole blood specimens obtained from those later developing ARDS were elevated significantly at admission and declined rapidly throughout the next 24 hrs. Significantly greater numbers of trauma patients' neutrophils migrated to concentrations of interleukin-8 (30 and 100 ng/mL) at each time point when compared with normal volunteers (Mann-Whitney U test, p<.05). Neutrophils isolated from major trauma patients exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hrs of admission, in contrast to the normal physiologic attenuation of migration seen in neutrophils isolated from normal laboratory volunteers. answer: These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.	yes
question: Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival? context: There are three main service delivery channels: clinical services, outreach, and family and community. To determine which delivery channels are associated with the greatest reductions in under-5 mortality rates (U5MR), we used data from sequential population-based surveys to examine the correlation between changes in coverage of clinical, outreach, and family and community services and in U5MR for 27 high-burden countries. Household survey data were abstracted from serial surveys in 27 countries. Average annual changes (AAC) between the most recent and penultimate survey were calculated for under-five mortality rates and for 22 variables in the domains of clinical, outreach, and family- and community-based services. For all 27 countries and a subset of 19 African countries, we conducted principal component analysis to reduce the variables into a few components in each domain and applied linear regression to assess the correlation between changes in the principal components and changes in under-five mortality rates after controlling for multiple potential confounding factors. AAC in under 5-mortality varied from 6.6% in Nepal to -0.9% in Kenya, with six of the 19 African countries all experiencing less than a 1% decline in mortality. The strongest correlation with reductions in U5MR was observed for access to clinical services (all countries: p = 0.02, r² = 0.58; 19 African countries p<0.001, r² = 0.67). For outreach activities, AAC U5MR was significantly correlated with antenatal care and family planning services, while AAC in immunization services showed no association. In the family- and community services domain, improvements in breastfeeding were associated with significant changes in mortality in the 30 countries but not in the African subset; while in the African countries, nutritional status improvements were associated with a significant decline in mortality. answer: Our findings support the importance of increasing access to clinical services, certain outreach services and breastfeeding and, in Africa, of improving nutritional status. Integrated programs that emphasize these services may lead to substantial mortality declines.	yes
question: Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children? context: We observed an endoscopic abnormally in a group of children with histological esophagitis. We termed this finding "vertical lines in esophageal mucosa" (VLEM). We examined the relationship between the presence of VLEM and significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies. Between January 1, 1992, and August 31, 1994, the senior author (JFF) performed 255 esophageal biopsies. The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies. The esophageal mucosa had a normal appearance on 160 endoscopic studies (Group 1) and VLEM were the only mucosal abnormalities in 41 endoscopies (Group 2). Histology was normal in 92 of 160 biopsies (57.5%) from Group 1, and 1 of 41 biopsies (2.4%) from Group 2. Most patients in Group 2 had eosinophilic esophagitis (34 of 41, 83%, specificity 0.85, sensitivity 0.5, p>0.001) which was of moderate to severe intensity (31 of 34, 91.2%, specificity 0.88, sensitivity 0.73, p<0.001). answer: Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.	yes
question: An HIV1/2 point of care test on sputum for screening TB/HIV co-infection in Central India - Will it work? context: To determine whether the OraQuick® HIV-1/2 Assay (OraSure Technologies, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) in sputum is a valid tool for HIV surveillance among TB patients. A cross sectional study was carried out on sputa of patients diagnosed with tuberculosis. Sputa were tested for antibodies to HIV using OraQuick® HIV-1/2 Assay (OraSure Technologies, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA). The results were compared with results of serum ELISA. Compared to serum ELISA, the OraQuick® HIV-1/2 Assay in sputum specimens reported 90% sensitivity (9/10) and 100% specificity (307/307), with a positive predictive value of 100% (95%CI: 66.37%-100.00%) and a negative predictive value of 99.68% (95%CI: 98.20%-99.99%). answer: This testing method may provide a useful strategy for conducting HIV surveillance in possible co-infected TB patients at peripheral centres. Since there is no investment on infrastructure, it may be possible for paramedical health professionals to carry out the test, particularly in areas with low HIV endemicity.	yes
question: Is crime associated with over-the-counter pharmacy syringe sales? context: More than 50,000 new HIV infections occur annually in the United States. Injection drug users represent twelve percent of incident HIV infections each year. Pharmacy sales of over-the-counter (OTC) syringes have helped prevent HIV transmission among injection drug users in many states throughout the United States. However, concerns exist among some law enforcement officials, policymakers, pharmacists, and community members about potential links between OTC syringe sales and crime. We used a geographic information system and novel spatial and longitudinal analyses to determine whether implementation of pharmacy-based OTC syringe sales were associated with reported crime between January 2006 and December 2008 in Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts. We assessed reported crime pre- and post-OTC syringe sales initiation as well as longitudinal associations between crime and OTC syringe-selling pharmacies. By December 2008, 9.3% (94/1010) of Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts had at least one OTC syringe-selling pharmacy. Overall reported crime counts and reported crime rates decreased between 2006 and 2008 in all 1010 Reporting Districts. Using generalized estimating equations and adjusting for potential confounders, reported crime rates were negatively associated with OTC syringe sales (adjusted rate ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.81, 0.99). answer: Our findings demonstrate that OTC pharmacy syringe sales were not associated with increases in reported crime in local communities in Los Angeles during 2006-2008.	yes
question: Colorectal cancer in young patients: is it a distinct clinical entity? context: The incidence of colorectal cancer in young patients is increasing. It remains unclear if the disease has unique features in this age group. This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study which included patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age ≤40 years in 1997-2013 matched 1:2 by year of diagnosis with consecutive colorectal cancer patients diagnosed at age>50 years during the same period. Patients aged 41-50 years were not included in the study, to accentuate potential age-related differences. Clinicopathological characteristics, treatment, and outcome were compared between groups. The cohort included 330 patients, followed for a median time of 65.9 months (range 4.7-211). Several significant differences were noted. The younger group had a different ethnic composition. They had higher rates of family history of colorectal cancer (p = 0.003), hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes (p < 0.0001), and inflammatory bowel disease (p = 0.007), and a lower rate of polyps (p < 0.0001). They were more likely to present with stage III or IV disease (p = 0.001), angiolymphatic invasion, signet cell ring adenocarcinoma, and rectal tumors (p = 0.02). Younger patients more frequently received treatment. Young patients had a worse estimated 5-year disease-free survival rate (57.6  vs. 70 %, p = 0.039), but this did not retain significance when analyzed by stage (p = 0.092). Estimated 5-year overall survival rates were 59.1 and 62.1 % in the younger and the control group, respectively (p = 0.565). answer: Colorectal cancer among young patients may constitute a distinct clinical entity. Further research is needed to validate our findings and define the optimal approach in this population.	yes
question: Does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes? context: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity. We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test. No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors. answer: The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.	yes
question: Can the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica be predicted at disease onset? context: To identify the features of PMR that may predict the duration of steroid therapy, the occurrence of relapses and the late development of GCA. Prospective cohort study of 176 patients with PMR, followed up for 5 years. Baseline factors associated with the duration of steroids therapy were identified using Cox regression. Predictors of relapse and the late development of GCA were identified using binary logistic regression. A total of 176 patients with PMR were included, of whom 124 stopped steroids within 5 years. The probability of stopping steroids within 5 years was independently reduced by an elevated plasma viscosity (PV) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.49; 95% CI 0.29, 0.82 for a PV>or = 2.00 mPa s compared with a PV<or = 1.80 mPa s; overall P = 0.024] and by starting treatment at>15 mg prednisolone (HR = 0.63; 95% CI 0.41, 0.97; P = 0.036). Either of these independently reduced the chances of stopping steroids within a given time interval between 27 and 51%. No significant predictors of relapse were identified. Predictors of late GCA on univariable analysis were female sex [odds ratio (OR) = 8.16; 95% CI 1.06, 63.13; P = 0.044], HLA-DRB1*0101 or -*0401 alleles (OR = 4.95; 95% CI 1.05, 23.34; P = 0.043), PV>or = 2.00 mPa s compared with PV<or = 1.80 mPa s (OR = 10.64; 95% CI 1.28, 88.38; P = 0.029) and initial prednisolone dose>15 mg (OR = 4.53; 95% CI 1.61, 12.79; P = 0.004). answer: A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.	yes
question: Does prior benign prostate biopsy predict outcome for patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy? context: To determine the effect of prior benign prostate biopsies on the surgical and clinical outcomes of patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy for prostate cancer. A total of 1369 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P<0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or greater; P<0.01). Overall, patients in the study group had lower probability (odds ratio 0.57, P<0.001) of biochemical failure compared with those in the control group. answer: A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.	yes
question: Is the Distance Worth It? context: It is unclear whether traveling long distances to high-volume centers would compensate for travel burden among patients undergoing rectal cancer resection. The purpose of this study was to determine whether operative volume outweighs the advantages of being treated locally by comparing the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated at local, low-volume centers versus far, high-volume centers. This was a population-based study. The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with rectal cancer. Patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between 2006 and 2012 were included. The outcomes of interest were margins, lymph node yield, receipt of neoadjuvant chemoradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, readmission within 30 days, 30-day and 90-day mortality, and 5-year overall survival. A total of 18,605 patients met inclusion criteria; 2067 patients were in the long-distance/high-volume group and 1362 in the short-distance/low-volume group. The median travel distance was 62.6 miles for the long-distance/high-volume group and 2.3 miles for the short-distance/low-volume group. Patients who were younger, white, privately insured, and stage III were more likely to have traveled to a high-volume center. When controlled for patient factors, stage, and hospital factors, patients in the short-distance/low-volume group had lower odds of a lymph node yield ≥12 (OR = 0.51) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (OR = 0.67) and higher 30-day (OR = 3.38) and 90-day mortality (OR = 2.07) compared with those in the long-distance/high-volume group. The short-distance/low-volume group had a 34% high risk of overall mortality at 5 years compared with the long-distance/high-volume group. We lacked data regarding patient and physician decision making and surgeon-specific factors. answer: Our results indicate that when controlled for patient, tumor, and hospital factors, patients who traveled a long distance to a high-volume center had improved lymph node yield, neoadjuvant chemoradiation receipt, and 30- and 90-day mortality compared with those who traveled a short distance to a low-volume center. They also had improved 5-year survival. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A446.	yes
question: Treatment as prevention in resource-limited settings: is it feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time? context: Recently, there has been increasing interest in the role of "treatment as prevention" (TasP). Some of the questions regarding TasP strategies arise from the perceived difficulties in achieving and maintaining viral load (VL) suppression over time and the risk of emergence of viral resistance that could compromise future treatment options. This study was conducted to assess these questions in a resource-limited setting. We performed a retrospective observational study of HIV-infected patients diagnosed in the pre-HAART era on follow-up at a private center from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from clinical charts. Analyses were performed to test for potential associations of selected variables with current virologic failure or use of third-line drugs. Of 619 patients on follow-up, 82 (13.2%) were diagnosed in the pre-HAART era. At the time of our study, 79 (96.3%) patients were on HAART, with a median duration of 14 years (IQR 12-15) of therapy, and exposure to mono or dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors regimens in 47.8% of cases. Sixty-nine patients (87.3%) had undetectable VL, 37 (46.8%) never presented virologic failure, and 19 (24.1%) experienced only one failure. Thirteen patients (16.5%) were receiving third-line ART regimens, with an average of 2.7-fold more virologic failures than those on first- or second-line regimens (p = 0.007). answer: Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.	yes
question: Does head positioning influence anterior chamber depth in pseudoexfoliation syndrome? context: Phacodonesis can occur in pseudoexfoliation syndrome because of impaired zonular support. This study investigates whether the increased mobility of the lens influences anterior chamber depth in patients with pseudoexfoliation while assuming a prone position. Central anterior chamber depth was measured in 39 patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation and elevated intraocular pressure. Patients were placed in a face-up position for 5 minutes, at which time anterior chamber depth and axial length were measured by A scan, and intraocular pressure was measured by Tonopen (Oculab, La Jolla, CA) in both eyes. The measurements were repeated on both eyes after 5 minutes in a face-down position. No significant differences in intraocular pressure or axial length between the prone and supine positions were found in either eye. Anterior chamber depth in eyes with pseudoexfoliation decreased from a mean of 3.08 mm in the supine position to a mean of 2.95 mm in the prone position, whereas mean anterior chamber depth in the fellow eyes decreased from 3.01 mm to 2.97 mm. The decrease in anterior chamber depth when facing down in the eyes with pseudoexfoliation was significantly greater than in the fellow eyes. answer: In patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation, the lens seems to be more mobile in the affected eye. This results in a shallower anterior chamber when the head is placed in a prone position. Whether this fact might potentially lead to transient pupillary block when engaging in activities such as facing down while reading warrants further study.	yes
question: Are intraoperative precursor events associated with postoperative major adverse events? context: Precursor events are undesirable events that can lead to a subsequent adverse event and have been associated with postoperative mortality. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether precursor events are associated with a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, acute renal failure, stroke, infection) in a low- to medium-risk coronary artery bypass grafting, valve, and valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting population. These events might be targets for strategies aimed at quality improvement. The present study was a retrospective cohort design performed at the Queen Elizabeth Health Science Centre. Low- to medium-risk patients who had experienced postoperative MACE were matched 1:1 with patients who had not experienced postoperative MACE. The operative notes, for both groups, were scored by 5 surgeons to determine the frequency of 4 precursor events: bleeding, difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, repair or regrafting, and incomplete revascularization or repair. A univariate comparison of ≥1 precursor events in the matched groups was performed. A total of 311 MACE patients (98.4%) were matched. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group (33% vs 24%; P = .015). The incidence of the individual events of bleeding and difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was significantly higher in the MACE group. Those patients with a precursor event in the absence of MACE also appeared to have a greater prevalence of other important postoperative outcomes. answer: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery who are exposed to intraoperative precursor events were more likely to experience a postoperative MACE. Quality improvement techniques aimed at mitigating the consequences of precursor events might improve the surgical outcomes for cardiac surgical patients.	yes
question: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): a role for polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes? context: DNA was collected for genotyping from 73 term newborns suffering from TTN and 55 healthy controls from a Caucasian cohort. TTN infants were more likely to be male (70% vs. 49%; p<0.05), had a lower mean birthweight (3120 +/- 450 vs. 3396 +/- 504 g; p<0.001) and gestational age (GA) (38.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 39.4 +/- 1.3 weeks; p<0.001) and were more often delivered by caesarean section (CS) (71% vs. 26%; p<0.001). The beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism differed significantly between cases and controls. Multivariate analysis provided beta1Gly49 homozygotes with higher risk for TTN (OR 18.5; 95%CI 1.5-229; p = 0.023) than beta1Ser49 allele carrier. Further analysis showed significant association of T-47C, A46G, C79G and C491T (TACC) haplotype in ADRB2 gene with TTN (p = 0.048). answer: We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.	yes
question: Could ADMA levels in young adults born preterm predict an early endothelial dysfunction? context: Sporadic data present in literature report how preterm birth and low birth weight are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases in later life. High levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a strong inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, are associated with the future development of adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac death. 1) to verify the presence of a statistically significant difference between ADMA levels in young adults born preterm at extremely low birth weight (<1000 g; ex-ELBW) and those of a control group of healthy adults born at term (C) and 2) to seek correlations between ADMA levels in ex-ELBW and anthropometric and clinical parameters (gender, chronological age, gestational age, birth weight, and duration of stay in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit). Thirty-two ex-ELBW subjects (11 males [M] and 21 females [F], aged 17-29years, mean age 22.2 ± 2.3 years) were compared with 25 C (7 M and 18F). ADMA levels were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography with highly sensitive laser fluorescent detection. ADMA levels were reduced in ex-ELBW subjects compared to C (0.606+0.095 vs 0.562+0.101 μmol/L, p<0.05), and significantly correlated inversely with gestational age (r=-0.61, p<0.00001) and birth weight (r=-0.57, p<0.0002). answer: Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.	yes
question: Informed consent for total hip arthroplasty: does a written information sheet improve recall by patients? context: To ascertain whether a written information sheet is acceptable to patients and improves recall of the consent interview. Prospective randomised controlled study using questionnaires, comparing a group of patients given information in a written sheet with appropriate explanation to a group given verbal information alone. A specialist orthopaedic surgery unit. The test group was 126 patients undergoing revision or primary total hip arthroplasty; 65 patients were given information verbally, 61 patients were given written information. Patients' recall of information given, tested with a questionnaire completed on admission (mean of 18 days later). The patients receiving written information scored significantly higher (48% correct answers) than the patients receiving verbal information (38% correct answers). answer: Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed.	yes
question: Quaternary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer: does surgical effort still matter? context: To evaluate surgical outcome and survival benefit after quaternary cytoreduction (QC) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) relapse. We systematically evaluated all consecutive patients undergoing QC in our institution over a 12-year period (October 2000-January 2012). All relevant surgical and clinical outcome parameters were systematically assessed. Forty-nine EOC patients (median age: 57; range: 28-76) underwent QC; in a median of 16 months (range:2-142) after previous chemotherapy. The majority of the patients had an initial FIGO stage III (67.3%), peritoneal carcinomatosis (77.6%) and no ascites (67.3%). At QC, patients presented following tumour pattern: lower abdomen 85.7%; middle abdomen 79.6% and upper abdomen 42.9%. Median duration of surgery was 292 min (range: a total macroscopic tumour clearance could be achieved. Rates of major operative morbidity and 30-day mortality were 28.6% and 2%, respectively.Mean follow-up from QC was 18.41 months (95% confidence interval (CI):12.64-24.18) and mean overall survival (OS) 23.05 months (95% CI: 15.5-30.6). Mean OS for patients without vs any tumour residuals was 43 months (95% CI: 26.4-59.5) vs 13.4 months (95% CI: 7.42-19.4); P=0.001. Mean OS for patients who received postoperative chemotherapy (n=18; 36.7%) vs those who did not was 40.5 months (95% CI: 27.4-53.6) vs 12.03 months (95% CI: 5.9-18.18); P<0.001.Multivariate analysis indentified multifocal tumour dissemination to be of predictive significance for incomplete tumour resection, higher operative morbidity and lower survival, while systemic chemotherapy subsequent to QC had a protective significant impact on OS. No prognostic impact had ascites, platinum resistance, high grading and advanced age. answer: Even in this highly advanced setting of the third EOC relapse, maximal therapeutic effort combining optimal surgery and chemotherapy appear to significantly prolong survival in a selected patients 'group'.	yes
question: Can a Novel Surgical Approach to the Temporomandibular Joint Improve Access and Reduce Complications? context: This clinical study investigated whether the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) could improve access and decrease complications. This retrospective evaluation consisted of a consecutive series of patients who underwent TMJ surgeries through the VMPA from January through December 2013. Patients with a history of TMJ surgery were excluded. Clinical data, including operating times, subjective complaints of incision scars, functional conditions of the auriculotemporal nerve and facial nerve, and other complications, were recorded and analyzed. All patients in this study were followed for at least 6 months. All patients (606 joints) had successful TMJ surgeries through the VMPA. All incisions healed favorably with an uneventful recovery. No patient developed permanent weakness of the facial nerve or other severe complications. answer: The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.	yes
question: Hepatic arterial embolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas: do technical factors affect prognosis? context: To evaluate retrospectively whether technical factors of hepatic arterial embolization affect the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Inclusion criteria of this study were the following: (1) patients received embolization as the initial treatment during 2003-2004, (2) Child A or B liver profile, (3) five or fewer HCCs with maximum diameter of 7 cm or smaller, and (4) no extrahepatic metastasis. Patient data were gathered from 43 centers. Prognostic factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Eight hundred fifteen patients were enrolled. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates were 92.0 % (95 % CI 90.1-93.9), 62.9 % (95 % CI 59.3-66.6), 39.0 % (95 % CI 35.1-43.0), and 26.7 % (95 % CI 22.6-30.8) in all patients. Univariate analysis showed a Child-Pugh class-A, alpha-fetoprotein level lower than 100 ng/ml, tumor size of 3 cm or smaller, tumor number of 3 or fewer, one-lobe tumor distribution, nodular tumor type, within the Milan criteria, stage I or II, no portal venous invasion, use of iodized oil, and selective embolization were significantly better prognostic factors. In the multivariate Cox model, the benefit to survival of selective embolization remained significant (hazard ratio 0.68; 95 % CI 0.48-0.97; p = 0.033). answer: Selective embolization contributes to survival in patients with HCCs.	yes
question: Is plate clearing a risk factor for obesity? context: Identifying eating behaviors which contribute to excess weight gain will inform obesity prevention strategies. A tendency to clear one's plate when eating may be a risk factor for obesity in an environment where food is plentiful. Whether plate clearing is associated with increased body weight in a cohort of US participants was examined. Nine hundred and ninety-three US adults (60% male, 80% American European, mean age=31 years) completed self-report measures of habitual plate clearing together with behavioral and demographic characteristics known to be associated with obesity. Plate clearing tendencies were positively associated with BMI and remained so after accounting for a large number of other demographic and behavioral predictors of BMI in analyses (β=0.18, 95% CIs=0.07, 0.29, P<0.001); an increased tendency to plate clear was associated with a significantly higher body weight. answer: The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.	yes
question: Outcomes of severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service: does trauma center level make a difference? context: Trauma centers are designated to provide systematized multidisciplinary care to injured patients. Effective trauma systems reduce patient mortality by facilitating the treatment of injured patients at appropriately resourced hospitals. Several U.S. studies report reduced mortality among patients admitted directly to a level I trauma center compared with those admitted to hospitals with less resources. It has yet to be shown whether there is an outcome benefit associated with the "level of hospital" initially treating severely injured trauma patients in Australia. This study was designed to determine whether the level of trauma center providing treatment impacts mortality and/or hospital length of stay. Outcomes were evaluated for severely injured trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS)>15 using NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury Management data from 2002-2007 for our regional health service. To assess the association between trauma centers and binary outcomes, a logistic regression model was used. To assess the association between trauma centers and continuous outcomes, a multivariable linear regression model was used. Sex, age, and ISS were included as covariates in all models. There were 1,986 trauma presentations during the 6-year period. Patients presenting to a level III trauma center had a significantly higher risk of death than those presenting to the level I center, regardless of age, sex, ISS, or prehospital time. Peer review of deaths at the level III center identified problems in care delivery in 15 cases associated with technical errors, delay in decision making, or errors of judgement. answer: Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.	yes
question: Does the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease? context: Epidemiologic studies have suggested that hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance are related to the development of colon cancer. Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up. Our population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification. Development of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.1. answer: Our data, derived from patients with coronary artery disease, support the hypothesis regarding a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer.	yes
question: Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme and frequency of severe hypoglycaemia in Type 1 diabetes: does a relationship exist? context: An association has been described between elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and an increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia (SH). To ascertain whether this reported association could be replicated in a different country, it was re-examined in 300 individuals with Type 1 diabetes. People with Type 1 diabetes, none of whom was taking renin-angiotensin system blocking drugs, were recruited. Participants recorded the frequency with which they had experienced SH. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and serum ACE were measured. The difference in the incidence of SH between different quartiles of ACE activity and the relationship between serum ACE and SH were examined using non-parametric statistical tests and a negative binomial model. Data were obtained from 300 patients [158 male; HbA(1c) median (range) 8.2% (5.2-12.8%), median age 36 years (16-88); duration of diabetes 14.5 years (2-49)]. The incidence of SH was 0.93 episodes per patient year. The mean incidence of SH in the top and bottom quartiles of ACE activity was 0.5 and 1.7 episodes per patient year, respectively, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.075). Spearman's test showed a very weak, although statistically significant, association between serum ACE level and SH incidence (r = 0.115, P = 0.047). The binomial model also showed a statistically significant (P = 0.002), but clinically weak, relationship between serum ACE and SH. answer: The present survey showed a weak relationship between serum ACE and the frequency of SH, the clinical relevance of which is unclear. This limits the proposed role for serum ACE as an index of risk for SH.	yes
question: Hypotension in patients with coronary disease: can profound hypotensive events cause myocardial ischaemic events? context: To determine whether anginal episodes might be related to extremes of hypotension in patients with ischaemic heart disease taking drugs to treat angina and heart failure. Observational study of patients with ischaemic heart disease attending an urban tertiary referral cardiology centre. A selected patient population was enrolled, having: angina on one or more hypotensive cardiovascular medications; hypotension on clinic or ambulatory measurement; and a resting ECG suitable for ambulatory monitoring. Patients had echocardiography, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and Holter monitoring. Hypotension induced ischaemic (HII) events were defined as episodes of ST segment ischaemia occurring at least one minute after an ambulatory blood pressure measurement (systolic/diastolic) below 100/65 mm Hg during the day, or 90/50 mm Hg at night. 25 suitable patients were enrolled, and 107 hypotensive events were documented. 40 ST events occurred in 14 patients, of which a quarter were symptomatic. Fourteen HII events occurred in eight patients, with 13 of the 14 preceded by a fall in diastolic pressure (median diastolic pressure 57.5 mm Hg, interquartile range 11, maximum 72 mm Hg, minimum 45 mm Hg), and six preceded by a fall in systolic pressure (chi(2) = 11.9, p<0.001). ST events were significantly associated with preceding hypotensive events (chi(2) = 40.2, p<0.0001). Patients with HII events were more frequently taking multiple hypotensive drug regimens (8/8 v 9/17, chi(2) = 5.54, p = 0.022). answer: In patients with ischaemic heart disease and hypotension, symptomatic and silent ischaemia occurred in a temporally causal relation with hypotension, particularly for diastolic pressures, suggesting that patients with coronary disease may be susceptible to ischaemic events incurred as a result of low blood pressure caused by excessive hypotensive drug treatment.	yes
question: Measuring hospital mortality rates: are 30-day data enough? context: We compare 30-day and 180-day postadmission hospital mortality rates for all Medicare patients and those in three categories of cardiac care: coronary artery bypass graft surgery, acute myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. DATA SOURCES/ Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) hospital mortality data for FY 1989. Using hospital level public use files of actual and predicted mortality at 30 and 180 days, we constructed residual mortality measures for each hospital. We ranked hospitals and used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to compare 0-30, 31-180, and 0-180-day postadmission mortality. For the admissions we studied, we found a broad range of hospital performance when we ranked hospitals using the 30-day data; some hospitals had much lower than predicted 30-day mortality rates, while others had much higher than predicted mortality rates. Data from the time period 31-180 days postadmission yield results that corroborate the 0-30 day postadmission data. Moreover, we found evidence that hospital performance on one condition is related to performance on the other conditions, but that the correlation is much weaker in the 31-180-day interval than in the 0-30-day period. Using ROC curves, we found that the 30-day data discriminated the top and bottom fifths of the 180-day data extremely well, especially for AMI outcomes. answer: Using data on cumulative hospital mortality from 180 days postadmission does not yield a different perspective from using data from 30 days postadmission for the conditions we studied.	yes
question: Is the ability to perform transurethral resection of the prostate influenced by the surgeon's previous experience? context: To evaluate the influence of the urologist's experience on the surgical results and complications of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Sixty-seven patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate without the use of a video camera were randomly allocated into three groups according to the urologist's experience: a urologist having done 25 transurethral resections of the prostate (Group I - 24 patients); a urologist having done 50 transurethral resections of the prostate (Group II - 24 patients); a senior urologist with vast transurethral resection of the prostate experience (Group III - 19 patients). The following were recorded: the weight of resected tissue, the duration of the resection procedure, the volume of irrigation used, the amount of irrigation absorbed and the hemoglobin and sodium levels in the serum during the procedure. There were no differences between the groups in the amount of irrigation fluid used per operation, the amount of irrigation fluid absorbed or hematocrit and hemoglobin variation during the procedure. The weight of resected tissue per minute was approximately four times higher in group III than in groups I and II. The mean absorbed irrigation fluid was similar between the groups, with no statistical difference between them (p=0.24). Four patients (6%) presented with TUR syndrome, without a significant difference between the groups. answer: The senior urologist was capable of resecting four times more tissue per time unit than the more inexperienced surgeons. Therefore, a surgeon's experience may be important to reduce the risk of secondary TURP due to recurring adenomas or adenomas that were incompletely resected. However, the incidence of complications was the same between the three groups.	yes
question: Syncope during bathing in infants, a pediatric form of water-induced urticaria? context: Apparent life-threatening events in infants are a difficult and frequent problem in pediatric practice. The prognosis is uncertain because of risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Eight infants aged 2 to 15 months were admitted during a period of 6 years; they suffered from similar maladies in the bath: on immersion, they became pale, hypotonic, still and unreactive; recovery took a few seconds after withdrawal from the bath and stimulation. Two diagnoses were initially considered: seizure or gastroesophageal reflux but this was doubtful. The hypothesis of an equivalent of aquagenic urticaria was then considered; as for patients with this disease, each infant's family contained members suffering from dermographism, maladies or eruption after exposure to water or sun. All six infants had dermographism. We found an increase in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in the two infants tested. The evolution of these "aquagenic maladies" was favourable after a few weeks without baths. After a 2-7 year follow-up, three out of seven infants continue to suffer from troubles associated with sun or water. answer: "Aquagenic maladies" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.	yes
question: Do women residents delay childbearing due to perceived career threats? context: To assess gender differences among residents regarding their plans to have children during residency and determine the most influential reasons for these differences. Using the Health Belief Model as a framework, the authors created an instrument to survey 424 residents from 11 residency programs at three academic medical institutions about their intentions to have children during residency. The authors developed a scale to assess the perceived career threats of having children during residency, evaluated its psychometric properties, and calculated the effect of the mediators. The response rate was 77% (328/424). Forty-one percent of men versus 27% of women planned to have children during residency (P = .01). The instrument measured four career threats-extended training, loss of fellowship positions, pregnancy complications, and interference with career plans-on a five-point Likert scale. The scale had a Cronbach alpha of 0.84 and an eigenvalue of 2.2. Compared with men, women had higher scores for each item and a higher mean score (2.9 versus 2.1, P = .001), signifying greater belief in the potential of pregnancy to threaten careers. After adjusting for age, institution, postgraduate year, and knowledge of parental leave policies, women were less likely to plan to have children during residency (odds ratio 0.46 [95% confidence interval 0.25-0.84]). In mediation analysis, threats to career explained 67% of the gender variance. answer: Women residents intentionally postpone pregnancy because of perceived threats to their careers. Medical educators should be aware of these findings when counseling female trainees.	yes
question: Is trabecular bone related to primary stability of miniscrews? context: To compare the primary stability of miniscrews inserted into bone blocks of different bone mineral densities (BMDs) with and without cortical bone, and investigate whether some trabecular properties could influence primary stability. Fifty-two bone blocks were extracted from fresh bovine pelvic bone. Four groups were created based on bone type (iliac or pubic region) and presence or absence of cortical bone. Specimens were micro-computed tomography imaged to evaluate trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, bone volume density (BV/TV), BMD, and cortical thickness. Miniscrews 1.4 mm in diameter and 6 mm long were inserted into the bone blocks, and primary stability was evaluated by insertion torque (IT), mini-implant mobility (PTV), and pull-out strength (PS). Intergroup comparison showed lower levels of primary stability when the BMD of trabecular bone was lower and in the absence of cortical bone (P≤.05). The Pearson correlation test showed correlation between trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and IT, PTV, and PS. There was correlation between cortical thickness and IT and PS (P≤.05). answer: Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.	yes
question: Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict outcome? context: The purpose of this study was to delineate early respiratory predictors of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We conducted a retrospective chart review of children with malignant and ARDS who needed mechanical ventilation and were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit from January 1987 to January 1997. Seventeen children with ARDS and malignancy aged 10.5 +/- 5.1 years were identified. Six of the 17 children (35.3%) survived. Sepsis syndrome was present in 70.6% of all the children. Peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation index values could distinguish outcome by day 3. A significant relationship between respiratory data and outcome related to efficiency of oxygenation, as determined by PaO(2)/FIO(2) and P(A-a)O(2), was present from day 8 after onset of mechanical ventilation. answer: Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.	yes
question: Neoadjuvant Imatinib in Locally Advanced Gastrointestinal stromal Tumours, Will Kit Mutation Analysis Be a Pathfinder? context: Longer duration of neoadjuvant (NA) imatinib (IM) used for locally advanced (LA) gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) is not based on biology of the tumour reflected by kit mutation analysis. LA or locally recurrent (LR) GIST treated with NA IM from May 2008 to March 2015 from a prospective database were included in the analysis. Archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) were used for testing KIT exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 by PCR. One hundred twenty-five patients with LA or LR GIST were treated with NA IM. Forty-five patients (36 %) had undergone c-kit mutation testing. Exon 11 was seen in 25 patients (55.5 %), 3 with exon 9 (6.7 %) and 2 with exon 13 (4.4 %). Twelve were wild type (26.6 %) and  3 (6.7 %) were declared uninterpretable. Response rate (RR) for the exon 11 mutants was higher than the non-exon 11 mutant group (84 vs. 40 %, p = 0.01). Disease stabilization rate (DSR) rates were also higher in the exon 11 subgroup than non-exon 11 group (92 vs. 75 %). Eighty-four per cent exon 11 and 75 % non-exon 11 mutants were surgical candidates. Patients undergoing surgery had significantly improved event free survival (EFS) (p < 0.001) compared to patients not undergoing surgery, with the same trend seen in OS (p = 0.021). Patients with a SD on response to NA IM had a lower EFS (p = 0.076) and OS compared to patients achieving CR/PR. There were no differences between the various exon variants in terms of outcomes and responses answer: Upfront evaluation of kit mutation status may help us in delineating separate treatment strategies for potentially biologically different tumours and assessing the correct timing of surgery for this subset of GIST.	yes
question: Is obesity a risk factor for wheezing among adolescents? context: To investigate the effect of obesity at the start of adolescence on the prevalence, incidence and maintenance of chest wheezing among individuals aged 11-15 years in a birth cohort in a developing country. The seventh follow-up of the 1993 Pelotas birth cohort occurred in 2004 (individuals aged 10-11 years). Between January and August 2008, the eighth follow-up of the cohort was conducted. All the individuals of the original cohort who were alive (who were then adolescents aged between 14 and 15 years) were targets for the study. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was used to define wheezing. In addition to the body mass index (BMI), used to define obesity by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, we assessed skinfold thickness. From the original cohort, 4,349 individuals were located (85.7% follow-up rate). The prevalence of chest wheezing at 11 and 15 years were 13.5% (95% CI: 12.5%-14.5%) and 12.1% (95% CI: 11.1%-13.1%), respectively. The prevalence of wheezing at both times was 4.5% (95% CI: 3.9%-5.1%) and the incidence of wheezing was 7.5% (95% CI: 6.7%-8.3%). Independent of the effect of various confounding variables, the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was 50% greater among obese individuals than among eutrophic individuals at 11 years (RR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.14-2.05). The greater the skinfold tertile at 11 years, the higher the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was (p = .011). Weight status and skinfolds did not present any association with incident wheezing. After controlling for confounding factors, the risk of persistent wheezing among obese individuals at 11 years was 1.82 (95% CI: 1.30-2.54). answer: Since obesity at the start of adolescence is associated with asthma symptom persistence, prevention and treatment of obesity may reduce avoidable healthcare costs and disease burden.	yes
question: Could ESC (Electronic Stability Control) change the way we drive? context: ESC (Electronic Stability Control) is a crash avoidance technology that reduces the likelihood of collisions involving loss of control. Although past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada. Two separate telephone surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles. The second surveyed 1017 owners/drivers of 2006-2008 ESC-equipped passenger vehicles from the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, Canada. Though ESC drivers were much more likely than drivers of other vehicles to be aware of ESC (77% vs. 39%) and that their own vehicle was equipped with it (63% vs. 8%), 23 percent had never heard of it. Ninety percent of drivers who knew that their vehicle was equipped with ESC believed that ESC had made it safer to drive and reported being confident that ESC would work in an emergency. Twenty-three percent of ESC owners who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle. answer: Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.	yes
question: Does a geriatric oncology consultation modify the cancer treatment plan for elderly patients? context: This study was performed to describe the treatment plan modifications after a geriatric oncology clinic. Assessment of health and functional status and cancer assessment was performed in older cancer patients referred to a cancer center. Between June 2004 and May 2005, 105 patients 70 years old or older referred to a geriatric oncology consultation at the Institut Curie cancer center were included. Functional status, nutritional status, mood, mobility, comorbidity, medication, social support, and place of residence were assessed. Oncology data and treatment decisions were recorded before and after this consultation. Data were analyzed for a possible correlation between one domain of the assessment and modification of the treatment plan. Patient characteristics included a median age of 79 years and a predominance of women with breast cancer. About one half of patients had an independent functional status. Nearly 15% presented severe undernourishment. Depression was suspected in 53.1% of cases. One third of these patients had>2 chronic diseases, and 74% of patients took>or =3 medications. Of the 93 patients with an initial treatment decision, the treatment plan was modified for 38.7% of cases after this assessment. Only body mass index and the absence of depressive symptoms were associated with a modification of the treatment plan. answer: The geriatric oncology consultation led to a modification of the cancer treatment plan in more than one third of cases. Further studies are needed to determine whether these modifications improve the outcome of these older patients.	yes
question: Can students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination? context: This study was designed to determine whether preclerkship performance examinations could accurately identify medical students at risk for failing a senior clinical performance examination (CPE). This study used a retrospective case-control, multiyear design, with contingency table analyses, to examine the performance of 412 students in the classes of 2005 to 2010 at a midwestern medical school. During their second year, these students took four CPEs that each used three standardized patient (SP) cases, for a total of 12 cases. The authors correlated each student's average year 2 case score with the student's average case score on a senior (year 4) CPE. Contingency table analysis was carried out using performance on the year 2 CPEs and passing/failing the senior CPE. Similar analyses using each student's United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 scores were also performed. Sensitivity, specificity, odds ratio, and relative risk were calculated for two year 2 performance standards. Students' low performances relative to their class on the year 2 CPEs were a strong predictor that they would fail the senior CPE. Their USMLE Step 1 scores also correlated with their performance on the senior CPE, although the predictive values for these scores were considerably weaker. answer: Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.	yes
question: Adults with mild intellectual disabilities: can their reading comprehension ability be improved? context: Adults with a mild intellectual disability (ID) often show poor decoding and reading comprehension skills. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of teaching text comprehension strategies to these adults. Specific research goals were to determine (1) the effects of two instruction conditions, i.e. strategy instruction to individuals and strategy instruction in small groups in a reciprocal teaching context; (2) intervention programme effects on specific strategy tests (so-called direct effects), and possible differences between strategies; (3) (long-term) transfer effects of the programme on general reading comprehension ability; and (4) the regression of general text comprehension by the variables of technical reading, IQ, reading comprehension of sentences (RCS), and pretest and posttest scores on the strategies taught. In total, 38 adults (age range 20-72 years; mean age of 36 years) with ID participated in the study. IQs ranged from 45 to 69 with a mean IQ of 58. The intervention programme involved 15 weekly lessons of 1 h each, taught during 3 months. Blocks of lessons included each of Brown and Palincsar's strategies of summarizing, questioning, clarifying and predicting, as participants read and studied narrative and expository texts. Results indicated no significant difference between group and individual instruction conditions. Second, direct programme effects - as determined by posttest-pretest contrasts for strategy tests - were substantial, except for the questioning strategy. Third, even more substantial was the transfer effect to general text comprehension. Moreover, the results on this test were well maintained at a follow-up test. Finally, the variance of general reading comprehension ability was best explained by the test of RCS, and only moderately by the strategies trained. answer: The presently used intervention programme provides a good starting point for adults with ID to become better readers.	yes
question: Can nurse-led preoperative education reduce anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery? context: The effect of preoperative education on anxiety and postoperative outcomes of cardiac surgery patients remains unclear.AIM: The aim of the study was to estimate the effectiveness of a nurse-led preoperative education on anxiety and postoperative outcomes. A randomised controlled study was designed. All the patients who were admitted for elective cardiac surgery in a general hospital in Athens with knowledge of the Greek language were eligible to take part in the study. Patients in the intervention group received preoperative education by specially trained nurses. The control group received the standard information by the ward personnel. Measurements of anxiety were conducted on admission-A, before surgery-B and before discharge-C by the state-trait anxiety inventory. The sample consisted of 395 patients (intervention group: 205, control group: 190). The state anxiety on the day before surgery decreased only in the intervention group (34.0 (8.4) versus 36.9 (10.7); P=0.001). The mean decrease in state score during the follow-up period was greater in the intervention group (P=0.001). No significant difference was found in the length of stay or readmission. Lower proportions of chest infection were found in the intervention group (10 (5.3) versus 1 (0.5); P=0.004). Multivariate linear regression revealed that education and score in trait anxiety scale on admission are independent predictors of a reduction in state anxiety. answer: Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.	yes
question: Is there a relationship between homocysteine and vitiligo? context: Pigmentary dilution is observed in patients with homocystinuria. Therefore, it is possible that an increase of local homocysteine (Hcy) interferes with normal melanogenesis and plays a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Vitamin B12 and folic acid, levels of which are decreased in vitiligo, are important cofactors in the metabolism of Hcy. Consequently, a nutritional deficiency in either of these two vitamins will result in an increase in homocysteine in the circulation, a finding that we expect to find in vitiligo. To determine the level of Hcy in the blood of patients with vitiligo as a first step in revealing if it has any relationship with the pathogenesis of vitiligo and consequently if this will have an impact on the treatment of vitiligo. Twenty-six patients of both sexes with vitiligo (age range 20-50 years, mean 31.4 +/- 8.09) and 26 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. After excluding factors that may affect serum Hcy levels, blood samples from patients and controls were obtained for homocysteine determination by enzyme immunoassay. The mean serum level of Hcy was significantly higher in patients with vitiligo than in controls (21.61 +/- 13.28 vs. 13.1 +/- 4.88 micromol L(-1); P<0.001). The Hcy level was significantly higher in male patients than in female patients (28.67 +/- 15.95 vs. 15.56 +/- 6.2 micromol L(-1); P<0.001) and in male controls compared with female controls (15.07 +/- 4.61 vs. 12.05 +/- 4.82 micromol L(-1); P<0.001). The homocysteine level was related to the activity of vitiligo and was significantly higher in patients with progressive disease than in controls (25.4 +/- 14.99 vs. 13.1 +/- 4.88 micromol L(-1); P<0.001). No significant difference in Hcy levels was found between either untreated vitiligo patients (22.77 +/- 13.36 micromol L(-1)) or patients receiving ultraviolet therapy (20.45 +/- 13.73 micromol L(-1)) and the total patient group (21.62 +/- 13.28 micromol L(-1)). answer: An elevated homocysteine level may be a precipitating factor for vitiligo in predisposed individuals. In view of the biological role of vitamin B(12) and folic acid in Hcy metabolism, we present our recommendations regarding the investigation and treatment of this common disease.	yes
question: Does para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester? context: Uterus-specific synthetic Prostaglandin analogues (gemeprost, sulproston etc.) have been widely employed for termination of pregnancy in the second trimester. Since paracervical anaesthesia may be useful during this procedure, we investigated in this prospective randomised study its impact on the clinical course of abortion and pain especially in the late first and second stage of labour. 20 women scheduled for elective abortion (fetal reasons) between the 16th and 23rd week of gestation were to be given 1 mg gemeprost vaginally every 6 hours. They were allocated at random: 10 women received only Pethidin intravenously and Butylscopolamine rectally, another 10 women were additionally treated by paracervical anaesthesia (2 x 10 ml 0.5% Bupivacain solution) at a cervical dilatation of 2-3 cm. A median of 3 gemeprost applications were administered in both groups. In the group without paracervical anaesthesia the median induction to abortion interval was 20 hours (range: 8-44 hours), 13 hours (range: 8-36 hours, NS) resulting for the paracervical anaesthesia group. The intervals from the last application of prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were slightly, but not significantly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group. The requirement of Butylscopolamine was higher in the latter group (p<0.05). The requirement of Pethidin and the intensity of pain (measured by pain scale according to Huskisson) especially in the late first stage of labour were not statistically different between both groups. Side effects of paracervical anaesthesia did not occur. answer: Paracervical anaesthesia is a method for analgesia during second trimester abortion with a low rate of side effects. It can shorten the duration of last period of second trimester abortion in some cases but has no impact on the perception of pain nor requirement of analgesics and so with only limited benefit in second trimester abortion with vaginal gemeprost.	yes
question: Is a 9-month treatment sufficient in tuberculous enterocolitis? context: Tuberculosis has increased in parallel with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic and the use of immunosuppressive therapy, and the growing incidence of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, especially with intestinal involvement, reflects this trend. However, the duration of anti-tuberculous therapy has not been clarified in intestinal tuberculosis.AIM: To compare the efficacy of different treatment durations in tuberculous enterocolitis in terms of response and recurrence rates. Forty patients with tuberculous enterocolitis were randomized prospectively: 22 patients into a 9-month and 18 into a 15-month group. Diagnosis was made either by colonoscopic findings of discrete ulcers and histopathological findings of caseating granuloma and/or acid-fast bacilli, or by clinical improvement after therapeutic trial. Patients were followed up with colonoscopy every other month until complete response or treatment completion, and then every 6 months for 1 year and annually. Complete response was defined as a resolution of symptoms and active tuberculosis by colonoscopy. Complete response was obtained in all patients in both groups. Two patients in the 9-month group and one in the 15-month group underwent operation due to intestinal obstruction and perianal fistula, respectively. No recurrence of active intestinal tuberculosis occurred during the follow-up period in either group. answer: Tuberculous enterocolitis can be managed by 9-month chemotherapy without disease recurrence. Further investigations are needed in immunocompromised patients.	yes
question: Reporting and interpreting red blood cell morphology: is there discordance between clinical pathologists and clinicians? context: Clinical pathologists (CPs) report RBC morphologic (RBC-M) changes to assist clinicians in prioritizing differential diagnoses. However, reporting is subjective, semiquantitative, and potentially biased. Reporting decisions vary among CPs, and reports may not be interpreted by clinicians as intended. The aims of this study were to survey clinicians and CPs about RBC-M terms and their clinical value, and identify areas of agreement and discordance. Online surveys were distributed to small animal clinicians via the Veterinary Information Network and to CPs via the ASVCP listserv. A quiz assessed understanding of RBC-M terms among respondent groups. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze responses to survey questions, and quiz scores were compared among groups. Analyzable responses were obtained from 1662 clinicians and 82 CPs. Both clinicians and CPs considered some terms, e.g., agglutination, useful, whereas only CPs considered other terms, e.g., ghost cells, useful. All groups interpreted certain terms, e.g., Heinz bodies, correctly, whereas some clinicians misinterpreted others, e.g., eccentrocytes. Responses revealed that CPs often do not report RBC-M they consider insignificant, when present in low numbers. Twenty-eight percent of clinicians think CPs review all blood smears while only 19% of CPs report reviewing all smears. answer: Important differences about the clinical relevance of certain RBC-M terms exist between clinicians and CPs. Inclusion of interpretive comments on CBC reports is the clearest way to ensure that RBC-M changes are interpreted as intended by the CP. Reporting practices should be examined critically to improve communication, transparency, and ultimately medical decisions.	yes
question: The inverse equity hypothesis: does it apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries? context: It is uncertain whether the inverse equity hypothesis-the idea that new health interventions are initially primarily accessed by the rich, but that inequalities narrow with diffusion to the poor-holds true for cancer screening in low and middle income countries (LMICs).This study examines the relationship between overall coverage and economic inequalities in coverage of cancer screening in four middle-income countries. Secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from the WHO study on Global Ageing and Adult Health in China, Mexico, Russia and South Africa (2007-2010). Three regression-based methods were used to measure economic inequalities: (1) Adjusted OR; (2) Relative Index of Inequality (RII); and (3) Slope Index of Inequality. Coverage for breast cancer screening was 10.5% in South Africa, 19.3% in China, 33.8% in Russia and 43% in Mexico, and coverage for cervical cancer screening was 24% in South Africa, 27.2% in China, 63.7% in Mexico and 81.5% in Russia. Economic inequalities in screening participation were substantially lower or non-existent in countries with higher aggregate coverage, for both breast cancer screening (RII: 14.57 in South Africa, 4.90 in China, 2.01 in Mexico, 1.04 in Russia) and cervical cancer screening (RII: 3.60 in China, 2.47 in South Africa, 1.39 in Mexico, 1.12 in Russia). answer: Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.	yes
question: Menopausal hormone therapy and irregular endometrial bleeding: a potential role for uterine natural killer cells? context: Irregular bleeding affects many users of combined menopausal hormone therapy (HT) and commonly leads to invasive and expensive investigations to exclude underlying malignancy. In most cases no abnormality is found. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and their regulatory cytokine IL-15 in irregular bleeding in HT users. This was a prospective observational study conducted between 2002 and 2004. The study was conducted in a tertiary referral menopause clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Western Australia. Patients included 117 postmenopausal women taking combined HT. Outpatient endometrial biopsies were taken during and outside bleeding episodes. The relationship between endometrial uNK cells (CD56+) and bleeding patterns was measured. We also addressed the impact of HT exposure on uNK cell populations, the relationship between endometrial IL-15 expression and uNK cell populations, and killer Ig like receptor genotype in subjects with irregular bleeding. Endometrial CD56+ uNK cells were significantly increased in biopsies obtained during bleeding episodes (P<0.001), compared with HT users with no bleeding. The highest level of IL-15 expression was also seen in biopsies taken during bleeding. No clear relationship between killer Ig like receptor genotype and bleeding on HT was observed. answer: Little is known about the mechanisms underlying irregular bleeding in HT users. This is the first report of uNK cells and their association with regulating cytokines in postmenopausal endometrium and demonstrates a possible mechanism by which HT may induce irregular bleeding.	yes
question: Can we ease the financial burden of colonoscopy? context: Polyps identified at colonoscopy are predominantly diminutive (<5 mm) with a small risk (>1%) of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma; however, the cost of histological assessment is substantial.AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether prediction of colonoscopy surveillance intervals based on real-time endoscopic assessment of polyp histology is accurate and cost effective. A prospective cohort study was conducted across a tertiary care and private community hospital. Ninety-four patients underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy of diminutive (≤5 mm) polyps from October 2012 to July 2013, yielding a total of 159 polyps. Polyps were examined and classified according to the Sano-Emura classification system. The endoscopic assessment (optical diagnosis) of polyp histology was used to predict appropriate colonoscopy surveillance intervals. The main outcome measure was the accuracy of optical diagnosis of diminutive colonic polyps against the gold standard of histological assessment. Optical diagnosis was correct in 105/108 (97.2%) adenomas. This yielded a sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values (with 95%CI) of 97.2% (92.1-99.4%), 78.4% (64.7-88.7%), 90.5% (83.7-95.2%) and 93% (80.9-98.5%) respectively. Ninety-two (98%) patients were correctly triaged to their repeat surveillance colonoscopy. Based on these findings, a cut and discard approach would have resulted in a saving of $319.77 per patient. answer: Endoscopists within a tertiary care setting can accurately predict diminutive polyp histology and confer an appropriate surveillance interval with an associated financial benefit to the healthcare system. However, limitations to its application in the community setting exist, which may improve with further training and high-definition colonoscopes.	yes
question: Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles? context: Some studies suggest that open access articles are more often cited than non-open access articles. However, the relationship between open access and citations count in a discipline such as intensive care medicine has not been studied to date. The present article analyzes the effect of open access publishing of scientific articles in intensive care medicine journals in terms of citations count. We evaluated a total of 161 articles (76% being non-open access articles) published in Intensive Care Medicine in the year 2008. Citation data were compared between the two groups up until April 30, 2011. Potentially confounding variables for citation counts were adjusted for in a linear multiple regression model. The median number (interquartile range) of citations of non-open access articles was 8 (4-12) versus 9 (6-18) in the case of open access articles (p=0.084). In the highest citation range (>8), the citation count was 13 (10-16) and 18 (13-21) (p=0.008), respectively. The mean follow-up was 37.5 ± 3 months in both groups. In the 30-35 months after publication, the average number (mean ± standard deviation) of citations per article per month of non-open access articles was 0.28 ± 0.6 versus 0.38 ± 0.7 in the case of open access articles (p=0.043). Independent factors for citation advantage were the Hirsch index of the first signing author (β=0.207; p=0.015) and open access status (β=3.618; p=0.006). answer: Open access publishing and the Hirsch index of the first signing author increase the impact of scientific articles. The open access advantage is greater for the more highly cited articles, and appears in the 30-35 months after publication.	yes
question: Can biofeedback training of psychophysiological responses enhance athletes' sport performance? context: In recent years, biofeedback has become increasingly popular for its proven success in peak performance training - the psychophysiological preparation of athletes for high-stakes sport competitions, such as the Olympic games. The aim of this research was to test whether an 8-week period of exposure to biofeedback training could improve the psychophysiological control over competitive anxiety and enhance athletic performance in participating subjects. Participants of this study were highly competent athletes, each training in different sport disciplines. The experimental group consisted of 18 athletes (4 women, 14 men), whereas the Control group had 21 athletes (4 women, 17 men). All athletes were between 16 and 34 years old. The biofeedback device, Nexus 10, was used to detect and measure the psychophysiological responses of athletes. Athletes from both groups (control and experimental) were subjected to stress tests at the beginning of the study and once again at its conclusion. In between, the experimental group received training in biofeedback techniques. We then calculated the overall percentage of athletes in the experimental group compared with those in the control group who were able to control respiration, skin conductance, heart rate, blood flow amplitude, heart rate variability, and heart respiration coherence. One year following completion of the initial study, we questioned athletes from the experimental group, to determine whether they continued to use these skills and if they could detect any subsequent enhancement in their athletic performance. We demonstrated that a greater number of participants in the experimental group were able to successfully control their psychophysiological parameters, in comparison to their peers in the control group. Significant results (p<0.05) were noted in regulation of GSR following short stress test conditions (p = 0.037), in regulation of HR after exposure to STROOP stressor (p = 0.037), in regulation of GSR following the Math and GSR stressors (p = 0.033, p = 0.409) and in achieving HR - breathing coherence following the math stressor (p = 0.042). answer: One year following completion of the training program, all participants from the experimental group indicated that they were still using the biofeedback - psycho-regulation skills. Furthermore, these participants uniformly reported believing that these skills had enhanced their athletic performance and general well-being.	yes
question: Are patients willing participants in the new wave of community-based medical education in regional and rural Australia? context: Community-based medical education is growing to meet the increased demand for quality clinical education in expanded settings, and its sustainability relies on patient participation. This study investigated patients' views on being used as an educational resource for teaching medical students. Questionnaire-based survey. Patients attending six rural and 11 regional general practices in New South Wales over 18 teaching sessions in November 2008, who consented to student involvement in their consultation. Patient perceptions, expectations and acceptance of medical student involvement in consultations, assessed by surveys before and after their consultations. 118 of 122 patients consented to medical student involvement; of these, 117 (99%) completed a survey before the consultation, and 100 (85%) after the consultation. Patients were overwhelmingly positive about their doctor and practice being involved in student teaching and felt they themselves played an important role. Pre-consultation, patients expressed reluctance to allow students to conduct some or all aspects of the consultation independently. However, after the consultation, they reported they would have accepted higher levels of involvement than actually occurred. answer: Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.	yes
question: Are pectins involved in cold acclimation and de-acclimation of winter oil-seed rape plants? context: The hypothesis was tested that pectin content and methylation degree participate in regulation of cell wall mechanical properties and in this way may affect tissue growth and freezing resistance over the course of plant cold acclimation and de-acclimation. Experiments were carried on the leaves of two double-haploid lines of winter oil-seed rape (Brassica napus subsp. oleifera), differing in winter survival and resistance to blackleg fungus (Leptosphaeria maculans). Plant acclimation in the cold (2 degrees C) brought about retardation of leaf expansion, concomitant with development of freezing resistance. These effects were associated with the increases in leaf tensile stiffness, cell wall and pectin contents, pectin methylesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) activity and the low-methylated pectin content, independently of the genotype studied. However, the cold-induced modifications in the cell wall properties were more pronounced in the leaves of the more pathogen-resistant genotype. De-acclimation promoted leaf expansion and reversed most of the cold-induced effects, with the exception of pectin methylesterase activity. answer: The results show that the temperature-dependent modifications in pectin content and their methyl esterification degree correlate with changes in tensile strength of a leaf tissue, and in this way affect leaf expansion ability and its resistance to freezing and to fungus pathogens.	yes
question: The HELPP syndrome--evidence of a possible systemic inflammatory response in pre-eclampsia? context: The principal causes of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy in Mexico, are preeclampsia/eclampsia, obstetric hemorrhage and puerperium complications; this is, 62% of maternal deaths in last years. HELLP syndrome was observed between 5 to 25% of the mortality in pregnancies of 36 weeks or less. To analyze patients with HELLP syndrome in ICU's (Intensive Care Unit) of a Gynecology and Obstetric Hospital, related to the abnormal hematological, hepatic and renal results with the obstetric case history and the clinical complications. A transversal study in patients with HELLP syndrome during 1998 and 1999 were carry out. Peripheral blood with Microangiopathic hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes: AST, ALT over 40 UI/L, even when were LDH lower than 600 UI/L. It was evaluated the hepatic and renal function, platelets count, microangiopathic hemolysis, arterial pressure, seizures, icteric skin color, blindness, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting and upper quadrant right abdominal pain. In newborn we analyzed gestational age, sex, weight and APGAR. We studied for an association between maternal and biochemical variables with Correlation Pearson Test, and dependence between variables with lineal regression model. 2878 patients with hypertensives disorders in pregnancy (11.64%). The 1.15% (n = 33) had HELLP syndrome with specific maternal mortality of 0.4 per 10,000 live birth, perinatal mortality of 1.62 per 10,000 live birth; and renal damage in 84.5%. Coefficient beta was higher between number of pregnancies to platelets count (-0.33) and creatinine clearance (-0.401). answer: We found an important renal damage, low platelets, elevated liver enzymes in women with two or more pregnancies. Then we propose there are similarities between HELLP syndrome and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) because they could have the same pathophysiology.	yes
question: Optimism and survival: does an optimistic outlook predict better survival at advanced ages? context: Studies examining predictors of survival among the oldest-old have primarily focused on objective measures, such as physical function and health status. Only a few studies have examined the effect of personality traits on survival, such as optimism. The aim of this study was to examine whether an optimistic outlook predicts survival among the oldest-old. The Danish 1905 Cohort Survey is a nationwide, longitudinal survey comprising all individuals born in Denmark in 1905. At baseline in 1998, a total of 2,262 persons aged 92 or 93 agreed to participate in the intake survey. The baseline in-person interview consisted of a comprehensive questionnaire including physical functioning and health, and a question about whether the respondent had an optimistic, neutral or pessimistic outlook on his or her own future. During the follow-up period of 12 years (1998-2010) there were 2,239 deaths (99 %) in the 1905 Cohort Survey. Univariable analyses revealed that optimistic women and men were at lower risk of death compared to their neutral counterparts [HR 0.82, 95 % CI (0.73-0.93) and 0.81, 95 % CI (0.66-0.99), respectively]. When confounding factors such as baseline physical and cognitive functioning and disease were taken into account the association between optimism and survival weakened in both sexes, but the general pattern persisted. Optimistic women were still at lower risk of death compared to neutral women [HR 0.85, 95 % CI (0.74-0.97)]. The risk of death was also decreased for optimistic men compared to their neutral counterparts, but the effect was non-significant [HR 0.91, 95 % CI (0.73-1.13)]. answer: An optimistic outlook appears to be a significant predictor of survival among the oldest-old women. It may also be a significant predictor for men but the sample size is small.	yes
question: Is combined therapy more effective than growth hormone or hyperbaric oxygen alone in the healing of left ischemic and non-ischemic colonic anastomoses? context: Our aim was to investigate the effects of growth hormone (GH), hyperbaric oxygen and combined therapy on normal and ischemic colonic anastomoses in rats. Eighty male Wistar rats were divided into eight groups (n = 10). In the first four groups, non-ischemic colonic anastomosis was performed, whereas in the remaining four groups, ischemic colonic anastomosis was performed. In groups 5, 6, 7, and 8, colonic ischemia was established by ligating 2 cm of the mesocolon on either side of the anastomosis. The control groups (1 and 5) received no treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was initiated immediately after surgery and continued for 4 days in groups 3 and 4. Groups 2 and 6 received recombinant human growth hormone, whereas groups 4 and 8 received GH and hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Relaparotomy was performed on postoperative day 4, and a perianastomotic colon segment 2 cm in length was excised for the detection of biochemical and mechanical parameters of anastomotic healing and histopathological evaluation. Combined treatment with hyperbaric oxygen and GH increased the mean bursting pressure values in all of the groups, and a statistically significant increase was noted in the ischemic groups compared to the controls (p<0.05). This improvement was more evident in the ischemic and normal groups treated with combined therapy. In addition, a histopathological evaluation of anastomotic neovascularization and collagen deposition showed significant differences among the groups. answer: Combined treatment with recombinant human growth hormone and hyperbaric oxygen resulted in a favorable therapeutic effect on the healing of ischemic colonic anastomoses.	yes
question: The promise of specialty pharmaceuticals: are they worth the price? context: Specialty pharmaceuticals have evolved beyond their status as niche drugs designed to treat rare conditions and are now poised to become the standard of care in a wide variety of common chronic illnesses. Due in part to the cost of these therapies, payers are increasingly demanding evidence of their value. Determining the value of these medications is hampered by a lack of robust pharmacoeconomic data. To outline emerging strategies and case study examples for the medical and pharmacy benefits management of specialty pharmaceuticals. The promise of specialty pharmaceuticals: increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, enhanced workplace productivity, decreased burden of disease, and reduced health care spending comes at a significant cost. These agents require special handling, administration, patient education, clinical support, and risk mitigation. Additionally, specialty drugs require distribution systems that ensure appropriate patient selection and data collection. With the specialty pharmaceutical pipeline overflowing with new medicines and an aging population increasingly relying on these novel treatments to treat common diseases, the challenge of managing the costs associated with these agents can be daunting. Aided by sophisticated pharmacoeconomic models to assess value, the cost impacts of these specialty drugs can be appropriately controlled. answer: Current evidence suggests that when used in targeted patient populations, specialty pharmaceuticals may represent a good health care value.	yes
question: A comparison of 500 prefilled textured saline breast implants versus 500 standard textured saline breast implants: is there a difference in deflation rates? context: This study provides the first large-volume (1000 implant) comparison of the deflation rates of Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured saline breast implants versus a control group of Mentor Siltex textured saline implants. A consecutive series of 500 Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured saline breast implants was compared with a consecutive series of 500 Mentor Siltex breast implants. Each breast implant was evaluated for a 4-year period, and the annual deflation rate (number of deflations during a given year divided by the total number of implants) and cumulative deflation rate (cumulative total of deflations through a given year divided by the total number of implants) were recorded. Statistical significance was calculated using the Fisher's exact test at year 1 and the chi-square analysis at years 2 through 4. The cumulative deflation rates of the Poly Implant Prosthesis implants was as follows: year 1, 1.2 percent; year 2, 5.6 percent; year 3, 11.4 percent; and year 4, 15.4 percent. The cumulative deflation rates of the Mentor implants was: year 1, 0.2 percent; year 2, 0.6 percent; year 3, 1.6 percent; and year 4, 4.4 percent. At year 1, the difference between deflation rates was not statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p>0.05). However, at year 2 (chi-square, 13.29; p<0.001), year 3 (chi-square, 37.91; p<0.001), and year 4 (chi-square, 32.69; p<0.001), the difference was statistically significant. answer: There was a statistically significant difference between the overall deflation rates of Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured saline breast implants and Mentor Siltex breast implants at year 2, year 3, and year 4. After 4 years, the 15.56 percent cumulative deflation rate of Poly Implant Prosthesis implants was over 3.5 times higher than the 4.31 percent deflation rate of the Mentor Siltex implants. There may be several factors contributing to the higher deflation rate seen in Poly Implant Prosthesis implants, including possible in vitro deflation before implantation and silicone shell curing technique. Nevertheless, this statistically significant deflation difference must be taken into account when balancing the risks and benefits of Poly Implant Prosthesis breast implants.	yes
question: Is withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism based on beta-endorphin deficiency? context: Associations between several psychopathological alterations and lowered beta-endorphin(beta E) plasma levels have already been stated in former studies. However, whereas single measures during static conditions generally failed in linking beta E levels with psychopathology, dynamic changes of beta E in particular have been shown to be associated with spells of anxiety and depression. During alcohol withdrawal, a decreased secretion of beta E with a delayed normalization has been reported, but up to now only few data became available regarding the interaction of plasma beta E and psychopathological parameters. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, and craving. We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol were also determined. In accordance with prior studies, beta E was significantly lowered on day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal relative to controls. Plasma levels of ACTH correlated significantly with beta E in alcoholics at both time points and in controls, without differing significantly between the groups. Self-rated anxiety, depression, and alcohol craving decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14. Levels of beta E were inversely correlated with anxiety day 1 (r=-0.58) and day 14 (r=-0.71). Partial correlation coefficients controlling for ACTH plasma levels revealed that this correlation was largely independent from ACTH. In addition, a significant inverse relationship was found between beta E and craving on day 14 (r=-0.28). No association appeared between beta E and depression. answer: Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.	yes
question: Cardiac reoperations in octogenarians: Do they really benefit? context: We retrospectively identified 84 consecutive patients aged ≥80 years, who underwent a cardiac reoperation at the department for Cardiothoracic Surgery in the Heart&Vessel Center Bad Bevensen between January 2007 and 2013. Demographic profiles as well as operative data were analyzed, and the patients were prospectively followed. Patient's functional status and quality of life were assessed with the Barthel Index, New York Heart Association class and the short form-12 questionnaire. The mean age of the study group (61 men, 23 women) was 81.9 ± 1.9 years. Most redo-procedures were carried out after primary coronary artery bypass grafting (65%), primary aortic valve replacement (21%) and primary mitral valve replacement (6%). The most frequent actual surgical procedures were combined coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement (26%), isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (19%), and isolated aortic valve replacement (19%). The mean length of hospital stay was 17 ± 15 days. In-hospital mortality counted for 32.1%. During follow up (29 ± 20 months) a further 19.0% of the patients died. The Barthel Index of the survivors was 89 ± 17 and their mean New York Heart Association class was 2 ± 1. A total of 93% of the patients were living at home. Summary scores of physical and mental health of the short form-12 questionnaire equalled those of an age- and sex-matched normative population. answer: Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.	yes
question: Is first-line single-agent mitoxantrone in the treatment of high-risk metastatic breast cancer patients as effective as combination chemotherapy? context: To determine whether patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer draw benefit from combination chemotherapy as first-line treatment. A total of 260 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer fulfilling high-risk criteria, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) or the combination of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC) every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles. Second-line treatment was vindesine, mitomycin and prednisolone. Gain from treatment was estimated using a modified Brunner's score composed of time to progression, patients' rating of the treatment benefit, alopecia, vomiting and performance status. After recruitment from 1992 to 1997 and observation from 1997 to 1999, the final evaluation showed that single-agent treatment with mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in terms of response, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival. There was, however, a significant difference in gain from treatment using a modified Brunner's score favoring the single-agent treatment arm. There was no evidence that any subgroup would fare better with combination treatment. answer: No significant difference was detected between the treatment with mitoxantrone as a single agent and the combination of low-dose FEC in terms of response or survival; therefore, the imperative of the necessity of first-line combination chemotherapy for patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer may be questioned. Since toxicity and quality of life score favored the single-agent mitoxantrone treatment arm, this treatment may be offered to patients preferring quality of life to a potential small prolongation of survival.	yes
question: Can clinical supervision sustain our workforce in the current healthcare landscape? context: Clinical supervision is widely recognised as a mechanism for providing professional support, professional development and clinical governance for healthcare workers. There have been limited studies about the effectiveness of clinical supervision for allied health and minimal studies conducted within the Australian health context. The aim of the present study was to identify whether clinical supervision was perceived to be effective by allied health professionals and to identify components that contributed to effectiveness. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire, administered through the health service's intranet. A cross-sectional study was conducted with community allied health workers (n = 82) 8 months after implementation of structured clinical supervision. Demographic data (age, gender), work-related history (profession employment level, years of experience), and supervision practice (number and length of supervision sessions) were collected through an online survey. The outcome measure, clinical supervision effectiveness, was operationalised using the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale-26 (MCSS-26). Data were analysed with Pearson correlation (r) and independent sample t-tests (t) with significance set at 0.05 (ie the probability of significant difference set at P<0.05). The length of the supervision sessions (r(s) ≥ 0.44), the number of sessions (r(s) ≥ 0.35) and the total period supervision had been received (r(s) ≥ 0.42) were all significantly positively correlated with the MCSS-26 domains of clinical supervision effectiveness. Three individual variables, namely 'receiving clinical supervision', 'having some choice in the allocation of clinical supervisor' and 'having a completed clinical supervision agreement', were also significantly associated with higher total MCSS-26 scores (P(s)<0.014). answer: The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.	yes
question: Can distal ureteral diameter predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection? context: To test the predictive value of distal ureteral diameter (UD) on reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). This was a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with primary VUR between 2009 and 2012 who were managed by endoscopic injection. Seventy preoperative and postoperative voiding cystourethrograms were reviewed. The largest UD within the false pelvis was measured. The UD was divided by the L1-L3 vertebral body distance to get the UD ratio (UDR). One radiologist interpreted the findings of voiding cystourethrography in all patients. Clinical outcome was defined as reflux resolution. Seventy patients were enrolled in this series (17 boys and 53 girls). Mean age was 5.9 years (1.2-13 years). Grade III presented in 37 patients (53%), and 33 patients (47%) were of grade IV. Mean distal UD was 5.5 mm (2.5-13 mm). Mean UDR was 37.8% (18%-70%). Macroplastique injection was performed in all. Subureteric injection was performed in 60 patients (86%), whereas intraureteric injection was performed in 10 patients. No postoperative complications were detected. The effect of grade, UD, and UDR on success after endoscopic injection was tested. UD and UDR were significant predictors of reflux resolution on logistic regression analysis (P <.007 and .001, respectively). answer: UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.	yes
question: Is lumbar drainage of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistula after spine surgery effective? context: Postoperative CSF fistulas were described in 16 of 198 patients (8%) who underwent spine surgery between 2009 and 2010. The choice of the therapeutic strategy was based on the clinical condition of the patients, taking into account the possibility to maintain the prone position continuously and the risk of morbidity due to prolonged bed rest. Six patients were treated conservatively (position prone for three weeks), ten patients were treated by positioning an external CSF lumbar drainage for ten days. The mean follow-up period was ten months. All patients healed their wound properly and no adverse events were recorded. Patients treated conservatively were cured in a mean period of 30 days, while patients treated with CSF drainage were cured in a mean period of 10 days. answer: Lumbar drainage seems to be effective and safe both in preventing CSF fistula in cases of large dural tears and debilitated/irradiated patients and in treating CSF leaks.	yes
question: Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery? context: Reconstructing the natural joint line in knee revision surgery improves clinical and functional outcome but may be challenging when both cartilage and bone were removed during previous operations. Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images. Using scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Two hundred knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined. For the fibular head, the mean difference between the treated and the control knee was 0.0 mm with narrow confidence limits ranging from -1.1 to 1.1. answer: As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision surgery.	yes
question: Can myometrial electrical activity identify patients in preterm labor? context: The objective of the study was to determine whether myometrial electrical activity can differentiate false from true preterm labor. Electrical uterine myography (EUM) was measured prospectively on 87 women, gestational age less than 35 weeks. The period between contractions, power of contraction peaks and movement of center of electrical activity (RMS), was used to develop an index score (1-5) for prediction of preterm delivery (PTD) within 14 days of the test. The score was compared with fetal fibronectin (fFN) and cervical length (CL). Patients delivering within 14 days from testing showed a higher index and mean RMS (P = .000). No patients with EUM index scores of 1-2 delivered in this time frame. Combining EUM with CL or fFN increased predictability. Logistic regression revealed that history of PTD and EUM index had 4- to 5-fold increased risk for PTD. Gestational age at testing, body mass index, fFN, and CL were nonsignificant contributors to PTD risk. answer: Measuring myometrial electrical activity may enhance identification of patients in true premature labor.	yes
question: Does the Transmissible Liability Index (TLI) assessed in late childhood predict suicidal symptoms at young adulthood? context: Our previous work demonstrated that the Transmissible Liability Index (TLI), an instrument designed as an index of liability for substance use disorder (SUD), is associated with risk of substance use disorder. This longitudinal study assessed whether TLI measured in 10-12-year-olds (late childhood) predicts suicidal behavior from age 12-14 (preadolescence) to age 25 (young adulthood). We hypothesized that TLI would predict number and severity of suicide attempts. Subjects were sons of men who had lifetime history of SUD (n = 250), called the High Average Risk (HAR) group, and sons of men with no lifetime history of a SUD (n = 250), called the Low Average Risk (LAR) group. The TLI was delineated at baseline (age 10-12), and age-specific versions were administered at 12-14, 16, 19, 22, and 25 years of age. TLI was significantly associated with number and severity of lifetime suicide attempts. answer: These findings confirm the hypothesis that TLI assessed at late childhood is a predictor of frequency and severity of suicidal behavior from preadolescence to young adulthood.	yes
question: Does strategy training reduce age-related deficits in working memory? context: Older adults typically perform worse on measures of working memory (WM) than do young adults; however, age-related differences in WM performance might be reduced if older adults use effective encoding strategies. The purpose of the current experiment was to evaluate WM performance after training individuals to use effective encoding strategies. Participants in the training group (older adults: n = 39; young adults: n = 41) were taught about various verbal encoding strategies and their differential effectiveness and were trained to use interactive imagery and sentence generation on a list-learning task. Participants in the control group (older: n = 37; young: n = 38) completed an equally engaging filler task. All participants completed a pre- and post-training reading span task, which included self-reported strategy use, as well as two transfer tasks that differed in the affordance to use the trained strategies - a paired-associate recall task and the self-ordered pointing task. Both young and older adults were able to use the target strategies on the WM task and showed gains in WM performance after training. The age-related WM deficit was not greatly affected, however, and the training gains did not transfer to the other cognitive tasks. In fact, participants attempted to adapt the trained strategies for a paired-associate recall task, but the increased strategy use did not benefit their performance. answer: Strategy training can boost WM performance, and its benefits appear to arise from strategy-specific effects and not from domain-general gains in cognitive ability.	no
question: Does the sex of acute stroke patients influence the effectiveness of rt-PA? context: Women have been reported to show more frequent recanalization and better recovery after intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment for acute stroke compared with men. To investigate this we studied a series of stroke patients receiving IV rt-PA and undergoing acute transcranial doppler (TCD) examination. Acute stroke patients received IV rt-PA and had acute TCD examination within 4 hours of symptom onset at 4 major stroke centers. TCD findings were interpreted using the Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia (TIBI) flow grading system. The recanalization rates, and poor 3-month outcomes (modified Rankin scale>2) of men and women were compared using the chi-square test. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess sex as a predictor of recanalization and poor 3-month outcome after controlling for age, baseline NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), time to treatment, hypertension, and blood glucose. 369 patients had TCD examinations before or during IV rt-PA treatment. The 199 (53.9%) men and 170 (46.1%) women had mean ages of 67 ± 13 and 70 ± 14 years, respectively. The sexes did not differ significantly in baseline stroke severity, time to TCD examination, or time to thrombolysis. Of the men, 68 (34.2%) had complete recanalization, 58 (29.1%) had partial recanalization, and 73 (36.6%) had no recanalization. Of the women, 53 (31.2%) had complete recanalization, 46 (27%) had partial recanalization, and 71 (41.8%) had no recanalization (p = 0.6). Multiple regression analyses showed no difference between the sexes in recanalization rate, time to recanalization, or clinical outcome at 3 months. answer: In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.	no
question: Does the early adopter of drugs exist? context: To analyse associations between indicators for adoption of new drugs and to test the hypothesis that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a personal trait independent of drug groups. In a population-based cohort study using register data, we analysed the prescribing of new drugs by Danish general practitioners. Angiotensin-II antagonists, triptans, selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 antagonists and esomeprazol were used in the assessment. As indicators of new drug uptake, we used adoption time, cumulative incidence, preference proportion, incidence rate and prescription cost and volume. For each measure, we ranked the general practices. Ranks were pair-wise plotted, and Pearson's correlation coefficient ( r) was calculated. Next, we analysed the correlation between ranks across different drug classes. For all indicators, the general practitioners' adoption of one group of drugs was poorly associated with adoption of others ( r</=0.49), indicating that early adoption of one type of drugs is not associated with early adoption of another. For all drug groups, adoption time adjusted for practice size was only weakly associated with other indicators ( r: -0.56 to -0.27). Indicators, based on cost and volume of drugs, were highly correlated ( r: 0.96-0.99), and the others correlated reasonably well ( r: 0.51-0.91). answer: Within drug groups, indicators of drug adoption, except for adoption time, correlate reasonably well. However, the theory that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a personal trait independent of the type of drug could not be confirmed. The notion of the early-drug-adopting general practitioner may be mistaken.	no
question: Can 'high-risk' human papillomaviruses (HPVs) be detected in human breast milk? context: Using polymerase chain reaction techniques, we evaluated the presence of HPV infection in human breast milk collected from 21 HPV-positive and 11 HPV-negative mothers. Of the 32 studied human milk specimens, no 'high-risk' HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 or 58 DNA was detected. answer: This preliminary case-control study indicates the absence of mucosal 'high-risk' HPV types in human breast milk.	no
question: Is nasogastric decompression useful in prevention of leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy? context: Although its excellent results, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) presents major complications ranging from 0% to 29%. Among them, the staple line leak presents an incidence varying from 0% to 7%. Many trials debated about different solutions in order to reduce leaks' incidence. No author has investigated the role of gastric decompression in the prevention of this complication. Aim of our work is to evaluate if this procedure can play a role in avoiding the occurrence of staple line leaks after LSG. Between January 2008 and November 2012, 145 patients were prospectively and randomly included in the study. Seventy patients composed the group A, whose operations were completed with placement of nasogastric tube; the other 75 patients were included in the group B, in which no nasogastric tube was placed. No statistical differences were observed between group A and group B regarding gender distribution, age, weight, and BMI. No intraoperative complications and no conversion occurred in both groups. Intraoperative blood loss (50.1 ± 42.3 vs. 52.5 ± 37.6 ml, respectively) and operative time (65.4 ± 25.5 vs. 62.6 ± 27.8 min, respectively) were comparable between the two groups (p: NS). One staple line leak (1.4%) occurred on 6th postoperative day in group A patients. No leak was observed in group B patients. Postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in group A vs. group B patients (7.6 ± 3.4 vs. 6.2 ± 3.1 days, respectively, p: 0.04). answer: Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.	no
question: Regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs? context: Hip fracture in geriatric patients has a substantial economic impact and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. At our institution, a regional anesthesia program was instituted for patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. This retrospective cohort review examines the effects of regional anesthesia (from mainly after July 2007) vs general anesthesia (mainly prior to July 2007) on morbidity, mortality and hospitalization costs. This retrospective cohort study involved data collection from electronic and paper charts of 308 patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture from September 2006 to December 2008. Data on postoperative morbidity, in-patient mortality, and cost of hospitalization (as estimated from data on hospital charges) were collected and analyzed. Seventy-three patients received regional anesthesia and 235 patients received general anesthesia. During July 2007, approximately halfway through the study period, a regional anesthesia and analgesia program was introduced. The average cost of hospitalization in patients who received surgery for hip fracture was no different between patients who receive regional or general anesthesia ($16,789 + 631 vs $16,815 + 643, respectively, P = 0.9557). Delay in surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) admission resulted in significantly higher hospitalization costs. Age, male gender, African American race and ICU admission were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality and rates of readmission are not statistically different between the two anesthesia groups. answer: There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.	no
question: Double reading of barium enemas: is it necessary? context: The purpose of our study was to determine the effectiveness, clinical impact, and feasibility of double reading barium enemas. Independent double readings of 1,003 consecutive barium enemas (822 double- and 181 single-contrast examinations) were prospectively performed. From this pool of 1,003 examinations, 994 were included in our study. Examinations showing at least one polyp or carcinoma 5 mm or larger were considered to have positive results. For combined readings, results were considered positive if either of the two interpreters reported finding a polyp or carcinoma. A McNemar test was used to compare the first reader's results with the combined results of the first and second readers. Results were retrospectively correlated with endoscopic or surgical results in 360 patients, and agreement between first and combined readings and endoscopic results was determined. Adding a second reader increased the number of positive results on examinations from 249 to 315 (p<0.0001) and resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients (9.9%). Sensitivity of the first and combined readings for detection of all lesions was identical, 76.3% (95% CI, 65.4-87.1%). Specificity decreased from 91.0% (95% CI, 87.9-94.3%) for the first reading to 86.4% (95% CI, 82.2-90.0%) for the combined reading. The overall measurement of agreement decreased from a kappa value of 61.8 (95% CI, 51.2-72.4%) for the first reading to 52.9 (95% CI, 42.2-63.6%) for the combined reading. The second reading required an average of 3.3 min. Sensitivity for the detection of adenocarcinomas was 100%. answer: Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.	no
question: Is there any evidence of a "July effect" in patients undergoing major cancer surgery? context: The "July effect" refers to the phenomenon of adverse impacts on patient care arising from the changeover in medical staff that takes place during this month at academic medical centres in North America. There has been some evidence supporting the presence of the July effect, including data from surgical specialties. Uniformity of care, regardless of time of year, is required for patients undergoing major cancer surgery. We therefore sought to perform a population-level assessment for the presence of a July effect in this field. We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to abstract data on patients undergoing 1 of 8 major cancer surgeries at academic medical centres between Jan. 1, 1999, and Dec. 30, 2009. The primary outcomes examined were postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses and subsequently multivariate analyses, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were performed to identify whether the time of surgery was an independent predictor of outcome after major cancer surgery. On univariate analysis, the overall postoperative complication rate, as well as genitourinary and hematologic complications specifically, was higher in July than the rest of the year. However, on multivariate analysis, only hematologic complications were significantly higher in July, with no difference in overall postoperative complication rate or in-hospital mortality for all 8 surgeries considered separately or together. answer: On the whole, the data confirm an absence of a July effect in patients undergoing major cancer surgery.	no
question: Characterization of the gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock: are hormonal differences responsible? context: To characterize the gender dimorphism after injury with specific reference to the reproductive age of the women (young,<48 yrs of age, vs. old,>52 yrs of age) in a cohort of severely injured trauma patients for which significant variation in postinjury care is minimized. Secondary data analysis of an ongoing prospective multicenter cohort study. Academic, level I trauma and intensive care unit centers. Blunt-injured adults with hemorrhagic shock. None. Separate Cox proportional hazard regression models were formulated based on all patients to evaluate the effects of gender on mortality, multiple organ failure, and nosocomial infection, after controlling for all important confounders. These models were then used to characterize the effect of gender in young and old age groups. Overall mortality, multiple organ failure, and nosocomial infection rates for the entire cohort (n = 1,036) were 20%, 40%, and 45%, respectively. Mean Injury Severity Score was 32 +/- 14 (mean +/- SD). Men (n = 680) and women (n = 356) were clinically similar except that men required higher crystalloid volumes, more often had a history of alcoholism and liver disease, and had greater ventilatory and intensive care unit requirements. Female gender was independently associated with a 43% and 23% lower risk of multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection, respectively. Gender remained an independent risk factor in young and old subgroup analysis, with the protection afforded by female gender remaining unchanged. answer: The independent protective effect of female gender on multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection rates remains significant in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women when compared with similarly aged men. This is contrary to previous experimental studies and the known physiologic sex hormone changes that occur after menopause in women. These results suggest that factors other than sex hormones may be responsible for gender-based differences after injury.	no
question: Cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction in elderly patients: does admission to a tertiary center improve survival? context: The role of early revascularization among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock remains controversial. Angioplasty registries, while suggesting a benefit, are subject to selection bias, and clinical trials have been underpowered to detect early benefits. If an invasive strategy is beneficial in this population, patients admitted to hospitals with onsite coronary revascularization might be expected to have a better prognosis. We sought to determine whether access to cardiovascular resources at the admitting hospital influenced the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. By use of the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project database (a retrospective medical record review of Medicare patients discharged with acute myocardial infarction), we identified patients aged>or =65 years whose myocardial infarction was complicated by cardiogenic shock. Of the 601 patients with cardiogenic shock, 287 (47.8%) were admitted to hospitals without revascularization services and 314 (52.2%) were admitted to hospitals with coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery facilities. Clinical characteristics were similar across the subgroups. Patients admitted to hospitals with revascularization services were more likely to undergo coronary revascularization during the index hospitalization and during the first month after acute myocardial infarction. After adjustment for demographic, clinical, hospital, and treatment strategies, the presence of onsite revascularization services was not associated with a significantly lower 30-day (odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.47, 1.45) or 1-year mortality (odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.49, 1.72). answer: In a community-based cohort, patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock did not have significantly different adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality, irrespective of the revascularization capabilities of the admitting hospital.	no
question: Sub-classification of low-grade cerebellar astrocytoma: is it clinically meaningful? context: The objectives were to identify prognostic factors for the survival of children with cerebellar astrocytoma, and to evaluate the reproducibility and prognostic value of histological sub-classification and grading. Children aged 0-14 years treated in Denmark for a cerebellar astrocytoma in the period 1960-1984 were included and followed until January 2001 or until their death. The histological specimens from each patient were reviewed for revised grading and classification according to three different classification schemes: the WHO, the Kernohan and the Daumas-Duport grading systems. The overall survival rate was 81% after a follow-up time of 15-40 years. The significant positive prognostic factors for survival were "surgically gross-total removal" of the tumour at surgery and location of the tumour in the cerebellum proper as opposed to location in the fourth ventricle. No difference in survival time was demonstrated when we compared pilocytic astrocytoma and fibrillary astrocytoma. Moreover, we found that the Kernohan and the WHO classification systems had no predictive value and that the Daumas-Duport system is unsuitable as a prognostic tool for low-grade posterior fossa astrocytomas. answer: Discordant observations due to interobserver variability make histological sub-classification of low-grade cerebellar astrocytomas in children insufficient for predicting prognosis and biological behaviour. Similar survival rates in a population of paediatric low-grade cerebellar astrocytomas of grades I and II indicate that tumour grade has no prognostic significance within this group of patients. "Surgically gross-total removal", especially if the tumour is located in the fourth ventricle is of the highest importance for long-term survival. Histological sub-classification of the tumours has no predictive value.	no
question: Department of Transportation vs self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors: do they agree? context: Research on stroke survivors' driving safety has typically used either self-reports or government records, but the extent to which the 2 may differ is not known. We compared government records and self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in a sample of stroke survivors. The 56 participants were originally recruited for a prospective study on driving and community re-integration post-stroke; the study population consisted of moderately impaired stroke survivors without severe communication disorders who had been referred for a driving assessment. The driving records of the 56 participants for the 5 years before study entry and the 1-year study period were acquired with written consent from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), Canada. Self-reports of collisions and convictions were acquired via a semistructured interview and then compared with the MTO records. Forty-three participants completed the study. For 7 (13.5%) the MTO records did not match the self-reports regarding collision involvement, and for 9 (17.3%) the MTO records did not match self-reports regarding driving convictions. The kappa coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement). When both sources of data were consulted, up to 56 percent more accidents and up to 46 percent more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone. answer: In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.	no
question: Cholesterol screening in school children: is family history reliable to choose the ones to screen? context: The study was carried on 2096 school children (1043 male, 1053 female) in Ankara. Their mean age was 9.03 years. Demographic properties of the study group and their families were determined and the serum lipid levels of the subjects were obtained. The relation between these demographic properties and lipid levels were investigated. In 135 of the subjects' serum cholesterol level was>or=200 mg/dL and in 83 subjects serum LDL-cholesterol level was>or=130 mg/dL. Despite 64.4% of the subjects reported a family history of hyperlipidemia, no relations between family history and serum lipid levels were found. answer: We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.	no
question: Did the call for boycott by the Catholic bishops affect the polio vaccination coverage in Kenya in 2015? context: Polio eradication is now feasible after removal of Nigeria from the list of endemic countries and global reduction of cases of wild polio virus in 2015 by more than 80%. However, all countries must remain focused to achieve eradication. In August 2015, the Catholic bishops in Kenya called for boycott of a polio vaccination campaign citing safety concerns with the polio vaccine. We conducted a survey to establish if the coverage was affected by the boycott. A cross sectional survey was conducted in all the 32 counties that participated in the campaign. A total of 90,157 children and 37,732 parents/guardians were sampled to determine the vaccination coverage and reasons for missed vaccination. The national vaccination coverage was 93% compared to 94% in the November 2014 campaign. The proportion of parents/guardians that belonged to Catholic Church was 31% compared to 7% of the children who were missed. Reasons for missed vaccination included house not being visited (44%), children not being at home at time of visit (38%), refusal by parents (12%), children being as leep (1%), and various other reasons (5%). Compared to the November 2014 campaign, the proportion of children who were not vaccinated due to parent's refusal significantly increased from 6% to 12% in August 2015. answer: The call for boycott did not affect the campaign significantly. However, if the call for boycott is repeated in future it could have some significant negative implication to polio eradication. It is therefore important to ensure that any vaccine safety issues are addressed accordingly.	no
question: Does early discharge with nurse home visits affect adequacy of newborn metabolic screening? context: To examine the impact of early discharge on newborn metabolic screening. Metabolic screening results were obtained from the Alabama State Lab for all infants born at our hospital between 8/1/97, and 1/31/99, and were matched with an existing database of early discharge infants. An early newborn discharge was defined as a discharge between 24 and 47 hours of age. Metabolic screening tests included phenylketonuria (PKU), hypothyroidism, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Early discharge and traditional stay infants were compared to determine the percentage of newborns screened and the timing of the first adequate specimen. The state laboratory received specimens from 3860 infants; 1324 were on early discharge newborns and 2536 infants in the traditional stay group. At least one filter paper test (PKU, hypothyroidism, and CAH) was collected on 99.2% of early discharge infants and 96.0% of traditional stay infants (P<.0001). Early discharge infants had a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate (22.9%) compared with traditional stay infants (14.3%, P<.0001) but had a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate (85.0% early discharge vs 75.3% traditional stay, P=.002). The early discharge group was more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life (1001, 98.8% early discharge vs 2016, 96.7% traditional stay, P=.0005). answer: In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.	no
question: Is alexithymia a risk factor for unexplained physical symptoms in general medical outpatients? context: Alexithymia is presumed to play an important predisposing role in the pathogenesis of medically unexplained physical symptoms. However, no research on alexithymia has been done among general medical outpatients who present with medically unexplained physical symptoms as their main problem and in which anxiety and depression have been considered as possible confounding factors. This study investigated whether patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms are more alexithymic than those with explained symptoms and whether, in patients with unexplained symptoms, alexithymia is associated with subjective health experience and use of medical services. We conducted a cross-sectional study among patients attending an internal medicine outpatient clinic. All patients were given a standardized interview and completed a number of questionnaires. After complete physical examinations, 169 of 321 patients had unexplained physical symptoms according to two independent raters. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms more often had a mental disorder, but overall they were not more alexithymic. In patients with unexplained physical symptoms, alexithymia was not associated with subjective health experience or use of medical services. However, patients with both unexplained symptoms and a mental disorder who also denied any possible connection between emotional problems and their physical symptoms did have more alexithymic traits. answer: In the majority of patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms, alexithymia does not play a role of clinical significance. Patients with unexplained physical symptoms are heterogeneous with respect to psychiatric syndrome pathology and probably also with respect to personality pathology.	no
question: Are sports medicine journals relevant and applicable to practitioners and athletes? context: To examine the evidence base of sports medicine research and assess how relevant and applicable it is to everyday practice. Original research articles, short reports, and case reports published in four major sport and exercise medicine journals were studied and classified according to the main topic of study and type of subjects used. The most common topic was sports science, and very few studies related to the treatment of injuries and medical conditions. The majority of published articles used healthy subjects sampled from the sedentary population, and few studies have been carried out on injured participants. answer: There is a dearth of studies addressing diagnostic and treatment interventions in the sports medicine literature. The evidence base for sports medicine must continue to increase in terms of volume and quality.	no
question: Does quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion change after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis? context: We compared left ventricular regional wall motion, the global left ventricular ejection fraction, and the New York Heart Association functional class pre- and postoperatively. Endomyocardial fibrosis is characterized by fibrous tissue deposition in the endomyocardium of the apex and/or inflow tract of one or both ventricles. Although left ventricular global systolic function is preserved, patients exhibit wall motion abnormalities in the apical and inferoapical regions. Fibrous tissue resection in New York Heart Association FC III and IV endomyocardial fibrosis patients has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality. We prospectively studied 30 patients (20 female, 30+/-10 years) before and 5+/-8 months after surgery. The left ventricular ejection fraction was determined using the area-length method. Regional left ventricular motion was measured by the centerline method. Five left ventricular segments were analyzed pre- and postoperatively. Abnormality was expressed in units of standard deviation from the mean motion in a normal reference population. Left ventricular wall motion in the five regions did not differ between pre- and postoperative measurements. Additionally, the left ventricular ejection fraction did not change after surgery (0.45+/-0.13% x 0.43+/-0.12% pre- and postoperatively, respectively). The New York Heart Association functional class improved to class I in 40% and class II in 43% of patients postoperatively (p<0.05). answer: Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.	no
question: Does gestational age misclassification explain the difference in birthweights for Australian aborigines and whites? context: After 34 weeks gestation, summary measures of location for birthweight (e.g means and centiles) increase more slowly for Australian Aborigines than for whites. A similar pattern has been observed for blacks in the US. This study tests whether the reported pattern is due to differential misclassification of gestational age. Simulation was used to measure the potential effect of differential misclassification of gestational age. Reported gestational age data were obtained from Queensland Perinatal Data Collection (QPDC). Estimates of the true distributions of gestational age were obtained by assuming various (plausible) types of misclassification and applying these to the reported distributions. Previous studies and data from the QPDC were used to help specify the birthweight distributions used in the simulations. At full term, the parameters of the birthweight distributions were robust to gestational age misclassification. At preterm, the 10th centiles were robust to misclassification. In contrast, the 90th centiles were sensitive to even minor misclassification. Extreme types of misclassification were required to remove the divergence in median birthweights for Aborigines and whites. answer: Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.	no
question: Utility of unenhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted MRI in children with sickle cell disease -- can it differentiate bone infarcts from acute osteomyelitis? context: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of bone infarcts and acute osteomyelitis. The clinical differentiation between a bone infarct and acute osteomyelitis is a diagnostic challenge. Unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated MR images have been proposed as a potential tool to differentiate bone infarcts from osteomyelitis. To evaluate the reliability of unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated MRI for differentiation between bone infarcts and acute osteomyelitis in children with SCD. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 31 children (20 boys, 11 girls; mean age 10.6 years, range 1.1-17.9 years) with SCD and acute bone pain who underwent MR imaging including unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated images from 2005 to 2010. Complete clinical charts were reviewed by a pediatric hematologist with training in infectious diseases to determine a clinical standard to define the presence or absence of osteomyelitis. A pediatric radiologist reviewed all MR imaging and was blinded to clinical information. Based on the signal intensity in T1-W fat-saturated images, the children were further classified as positive for osteomyelitis (low bone marrow signal intensity) or positive for bone infarct (high bone marrow signal intensity). Based on the clinical standard, 5 children were classified as positive for osteomyelitis and 26 children as positive for bone infarct (negative for osteomyelitis). The bone marrow signal intensity on T1-W fat-saturated imaging was not significant for the differentiation between bone infarct and osteomyelitis (P = 0.56). None of the additional evaluated imaging parameters on unenhanced MRI proved reliable in differentiating these diagnoses. answer: The bone marrow signal intensity on unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated MR images is not a reliable criterion to differentiate bone infarcts from osteomyelitis in children.	no
question: Do African American women require fewer calories to maintain weight? context: The high prevalence of obesity in African American (AA) women may result, in part, from a lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) than non-AA women. If true, AA women should require fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight. Our objective was to determine in the setting of a controlled feeding study, if AA women required fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight. This analysis includes 206 women (73% AA), aged 22-75 years, who participated in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial-a multicenter, randomized, controlled, feeding study comparing the effects of 3 dietary patterns on blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. After a 3-week run-in, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 dietary patterns for 8 weeks. Calorie intake was adjusted during feeding to maintain stable weight. The primary outcome of this analysis was average daily calorie (kcal) intake during feeding. AA women had higher baseline weight and body mass index than non-AA women (78.4 vs 72.4 kg, P<.01; 29.0 vs 27.6 kg/m(2), P<.05, respectively). During intervention feeding, mean (SD) kcal was 2168 (293) in AA women and 2073 (284) in non-AA women. Mean intake was 94.7 kcal higher in AA women than in non-AA women (P<.05). After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no difference in caloric intake between AA and non-AA women (Δ = -2.8 kcal, P = .95). answer: These results do not support the view that AA women are at greater risk for obesity because they require fewer calories to maintain weight.	no
question: The use of audit to identify maternal mortality in different settings: is it just a difference between the rich and the poor? context: To illustrate how maternal mortality audit identifies different causes of and contributing factors to maternal deaths in different settings in low- and high-income countries and how this can lead to local solutions in reducing maternal deaths. Descriptive study of maternal mortality from different settings and review of data on the history of reducing maternal mortality in what are now high-income countries. Kalabo district in Zambia, Farafenni division in The Gambia, Onandjokwe district in Namibia, and the Netherlands. Population of rural areas in Zambia and The Gambia, peri-urban population in Namibia and nationwide data from The Netherlands. Data from facility-based maternal mortality audits from three African hospitals and data from the latest confidential enquiry in The Netherlands. Maternal mortality ratio (MMR), causes (direct and indirect) and characteristics. MMR ranged from 10 per 100,000 (the Netherlands) to 1540 per 100,000 (The Gambia). Differences in causes of deaths were characterized by HIV/AIDS in Namibia, sepsis and HIV/AIDS in Zambia, (pre-)eclampsia in the Netherlands and obstructed labour in The Gambia. answer: Differences in maternal mortality are more than just differences between the rich and poor. Acknowledging the magnitude of maternal mortality and harnessing a strong political will to tackle the issues are important factors. However, there is no single, general solution to reduce maternal mortality, and identification of problems needs to be promoted through audit, both national and local.	no
question: Are wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation equivalent? context: The authors examined equivalence of wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation (PNA) as concepts. A cross-sectional correlational design was used. Participants were recruited from 22 nursing homes and 6 assisted living facilities in two states. Ambulatory residents meeting DSM-IV criteria for dementia (N = 181) were studied. Video-tapes for up to twelve 20-minute observations per participant were coded for wandering using an empirically derived taxonomy of ambulation patterns. Separate raters coded the same tapes for six PNA behaviors on the agitation behavior mapping instrument. Most participants (73.5%) wandered; all showed PNA behaviors. Factor analyses yielded an one-factor solution for wandering (explained variance = 43.66%) and a two-factor solution for PNA (explained variance = 53.45%). Overall wandering correlated significantly with PNA Factor 1 (df =179, r = 0.68, p<0.001) and Factor 2, but at a lower value (df = 179, r = 0.26, p<0.01). answer: Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.	no
question: Is the covering of the resection margin after distal pancreatectomy advantageous? context: In recent years, many advances in pancreatic surgery have been achieved. Nevertheless, the rate of pancreatic fistula following pancreatic tail resection does not differ between various techniques, still reaching up to 30% in prospective multicentric studies. Taking into account contradictory results concerning the usefulness of covering resection margins after distal pancreatectomy, we sought to perform a systematic, retrospective analysis of patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy at our center. We retrospectively analysed the data of 74 patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy between 2001 and 2011 at the community hospital in Neuss. Demographic factors, indications, postoperative complications, surgical or interventional revisions, and length of hospital stay were registered to compare the outcome of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy with coverage of the resection margins vs. patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy without coverage of the resection margins. Differences between groups were calculated using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test. Main indications for pancreatic surgery were insulinoma (n=18, 24%), ductal adenocarcinoma (n=9, 12%), non-single-insulinoma-pancreatogenic-hypoglycemia-syndrome (NSIPHS) (n=8, 11%), and pancreatic cysts with pancreatitis (n=8, 11%). In 39 of 74 (53%) patients no postoperative complications were noted. In detail we found that 23/42 (55%) patients with coverage vs. 16/32 (50%) without coverage of the resection margins had no postoperative complications. The most common complications were pancreatic fistulas in eleven patients (15%), and postoperative bleeding in nine patients (12%). Pancreatic fistulas occurred in patients without coverage of the resection margins in 7/32 (22%) vs. 4/42 (1011%) with coverage are of the resection margins, yet without reaching statistical significance. Postoperative bleeding ensued with equal frequency in both groups (12% with coverage versus 13% without coverage of the resection margins). The reoperation rate was 8%. The hospital stay for patients without coverage was 13 days (5-60) vs. 17 days (8-60) for patients with coverage. answer: The results show no significant difference in the fistula rate after covering of the resection margin after distal pancreatectomy, which contributes to the picture of an unsolved problem.	no
question: Does continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes? context: Bolus intravenous injection of epinephrine can decrease uterine blood flow. This study examined the effects of intravenous infusion of epinephrine on uterine blood flow in the gravid ewe. Maternal and fetal vascular catheters and a maternal electromagnetic uterine artery flow probe were implanted in 10 near-term gravid ewes. After recovery, saline, 0.125% bupivacaine, 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine, and 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:800,000 epinephrine were infused into the maternal superior vena cava. Drugs were infused at 10 mL/h for 30 minutes and then at 20 mL/h for an additional 30 minutes. Animals also received an intravenous bolus of epinephrine 15 micrograms. Throughout all infusions, maternal heart rate, systemic and pulmonary blood pressures, uterine blood flow, cardiac output, and acid-base balance were measured, as well as fetal heart rate, blood pressure, and acid-base balance. Epinephrine 15 micrograms decreased uterine blood flow to 68 +/- 14% of baseline (mean +/- SD). Infusion of all solutions had no effect on any measured hemodynamic variable. answer: In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.	no
question: Do healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources? context: Governments are urged to determine methods to control the use of medical resources and curb the rise of healthcare costs. The question is, do health behaviors have an impact on the use of medical resources? This study aims to identify and understand the difference in the number of outpatient visits and health examinations based on various health behaviors and to determine whether patients seek medical care for illness from the same physicians. This study used the dataset derived from the Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of Kaohsiung, Taiwan in 2005. Persons older than 15 years were surveyed using an on-site questionnaire. A total of 2911 persons were enrolled in this study. Independent t-tests, chi-square tests, one-way ANOVA, multiple linear regression and binominal logistic regression were used in the data analysis. The regression model for the frequency of doctor visits, health examinations, and whether the same physician is sought for medical care has demonstrated significant correlations with gender, age and education-level variables. Four health behaviors (i.e., exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, drinking habits) exhibited a significant correlation with healthcare utilization (P<0.05). answer: Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.	no
question: Do risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by affective disorder polarity? context: Suicide is a leading cause of death and has been strongly associated with affective disorders. The influence of affective disorder polarity on subsequent suicide attempts or completions and any differential effect of suicide risk factors by polarity were assessed in a prospective cohort. Participants with major affective disorders in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study (CDS) were followed prospectively for up to 25 years. A total of 909 participants meeting prospective diagnostic criteria for major depressive and bipolar disorders were followed through 4204 mood cycles. Suicidal behavior was defined as suicide attempts or completions. Mixed-effects, grouped-time survival analysis assessed risk of suicidal behavior and differential effects of risk factors for suicidal behavior by polarity. In addition to polarity, the main effects of age, gender, hopelessness, married status, prior suicide attempts and active substance abuse were modeled, with mood cycle as the unit of analysis. After controlling for age of onset, there were no differences in prior suicide attempts by polarity although bipolar participants had more prior severe attempts. During follow-up, 40 cycles ended in suicide and 384 cycles contained at least one suicide attempt. Age, hopelessness and active substance abuse but not polarity predicted suicidal behavior. The effects of risk factors did not differ by polarity. answer: Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.	no
question: Thrombosis prophylaxis in hospitalised medical patients: does prophylaxis in all patients make sense? context: Most studies on thrombosis prophylaxis focus on postoperative venous thrombosis. In medical wards thrombosis prophylaxis is generally restricted to patients who are immobilised. Our primary aim was to investigate the incidence of venous thrombosis in a general internal ward, to assess whether more rigorous prophylaxis would be feasible. We investigated the incidence of venous thrombosis in patients hospitalised from 1992 to 1996 and related our findings to literature reports. The incidence of symptomatic venous thrombosis in internal patients during hospitalisation was 39/6332 (0.6%). Among these 39 patients, 24 had a malignancy, whereas 876 out of all 6332 patients had a known malignancy. So, the incidence in this group with cancer was 2.7% compared with 0.3% (15/5456) in the non-cancer group (relative risk for venous thrombosis due to malignancy was 10.0 (95%C.I. 5.3-18.9). answer: The incidence of venous thrombosis during hospitalisation in a department of general internal medicine is low and does not justify prophylaxis in all internal patients. Cancer is a strong risk factor for hospital-acquired thrombosis in the medical ward. Further studies may answer the question as to whether thrombosis prophylaxis in this subgroup is feasible.	no
question: Is late-night salivary cortisol a better screening test for possible cortisol excess than standard screening tests in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes? context: Forty obese patients with T2DM without clinical features of Cushing's syndrome were recruited. Plasma, urinary and salivary cortisol were measured directly by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal antibodies. The specificities of the three tests using various cutoffs were calculated and compared, employing the assumption that none of the patients had hypercortisolism. The patients had a mean age and BMI of 56 years (range 31-75) and 37 kg/m² (31-56) respectively. All 40 provided late-night salivary cortisol samples. Thirty-eight patients completed all three tests. Two patients only completed two screening tests. The specificities of late-night salivary cortisol (cutoff 10 nmol/L), 24hr UFC (400 nmol) and 1mg DST (50 nmol/L) were 70% (95% CI 53-83%), 90% (76-97%) and 72% (55-85%) respectively. The specificity of late-night salivary cortisol was significantly less than 24 hr UFC (P=0.039) but not 1mg DST (P>0.99). answer: Late-night salivary cortisol has a poor specificity for cortisol excess in obese patients with T2DM with 24 hr UFC showing significantly better specificity in our population.	no
question: Does escalation of the apical dose change treatment outcome in beta-radiation of posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques? context: To show the results of treating posterior uveal melanomas with 106Ru plaque beta-ray radiotherapy and to review and discuss the literature concerning the optimal apical dose prescription (100 vs. 160 Gy). Forty-eight patients with uveal melanomas (median height 3.85 mm + 1 mm sclera) were treated with ruthenium plaques. The median apical dose was 120 Gy, the median scleral dose 546 Gy. After 5.8 years of follow-up, the overall 5-year survival rate was 90%, the disease specific 5-year survival rate was 92% (3 patients alive with metastasis). Six percent received a second ruthenium application, 10% of the eyes had to be enucleated. Local control was achieved in 90% of the patients with conservative therapy alone. Central or paracentral tumors showed 50% of the pretherapeutic vision after 4 years, and 80% of the vision was preserved in those with peripheral tumors. The main side effects were mostly an uncomplicated retinopathy (30%); macular degeneration or scarring led to poor central vision in 30% of cases. answer: Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.	no
question: Estradiol and Antagonist Pretreatment Prior to Microdose Leuprolide in in Vitro Fertilization. Does It Improve IVF Outcomes in Poor Responders as Compared to Oral Contraceptive Pill? context: To compare in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in low responders stimulated with microdose leuprolide protocol (ML) following pretreatment with either oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or luteal estradiol (E2) + GnRH antagonist (E2 + antag) for follicular synchronization prior to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). This was a retrospective study of 130 women, who were poor responders, undergoing IVF with either OCP/ML or E2+ antag/ML protocols. The main outcome measures were ongoing pregnancy rates, number of oocytes retrieved, and cancellation rate. Both groups were similar in baseline characteristics. There were no significant differences in gonadotropin requirement, cancellation rate, and number of embryos transferred. Ongoing pregnancy rates (40% vs. 15%) were significantly higher in the OCP/ML group. Trends toward greater number of oocytes retrieved (7.7 ± 3.4 vs. 5.9 ± 4.2) and improved implantation rates (20% vs. 12%) were also noted, but these did not reach statistical significance. answer: E2+antag pretreatment does not appear to improve IVF outcomes in ML protocol when compared to the standard OCP in poor responders. Randomized trials with adequate power to study the optimal method of steroid pretreatments appear justified.	no
question: Do risk calculators accurately predict surgical site occurrences? context: Current risk assessment models for surgical site occurrence (SSO) and surgical site infection (SSI) after open ventral hernia repair (VHR) have limited external validation. Our aim was to determine (1) whether existing models stratify patients into groups by risk and (2) which model best predicts the rate of SSO and SSI. Patients who underwent open VHR and were followed for at least 1 mo were included. Using two data sets-a retrospective multicenter database (Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative) and a single-center prospective database (Prospective)-each patient was assigned a predicted risk with each of the following models: Ventral Hernia Risk Score (VHRS), Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wound Class, and Hernia Wound Risk Assessment Tool (HW-RAT). Patients in the Prospective database were also assigned a predicted risk from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve [AUC]) were compared to assess the predictive accuracy of the models for SSO and SSI. Pearson's chi-square was used to determine which models were able to risk-stratify patients into groups with significantly differing rates of actual SSO and SSI. The Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative database (n = 795) had an overall SSO and SSI rate of 23% and 17%, respectively. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.56, 0.54, 0.52, and 0.60) and SSI (0.55, 0.53, 0.50, and 0.58). The VHRS (P = 0.01) and HW-RAT (P < 0.01) significantly stratified patients into tiers for SSO, whereas the VHWG (P < 0.05) and HW-RAT (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI. In the Prospective database (n = 88), 14% and 8% developed an SSO and SSI, respectively. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.63, 0.54, 0.50, 0.57, and 0.69) and modest for SSI (0.81, 0.64, 0.55, 0.62, and 0.73). The ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.01) stratified for SSO, whereas the VHRS (P < 0.01) and ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI. In both databases, VHRS, VHWG, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overestimated risk of SSO and SSI, whereas HW-RAT and ACS-NSQIP underestimated risk for all groups. answer: All five existing predictive models have limited ability to risk-stratify patients and accurately assess risk of SSO. However, both the VHRS and ACS-NSQIP demonstrate modest success in identifying patients at risk for SSI. Continued model refinement is needed to improve the two highest performing models (VHRS and ACS-NSQIP) along with investigation to determine whether modifications to perioperative management based on risk stratification can improve outcomes.	no
question: Is diffusion-weighted imaging a significant indicator of the development of vascularization in hypovascular hepatocellular lesions? context: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in predicting the development of vascularization in hypovascular hepatocellular lesions (HHLs). Forty-two HHLs that were diagnosed by computed tomographic (CT) arteriography were evaluated retrospectively. The lesion on DWI was classified as isointense, hypointense, or hyperintense. Follow-up studies that included intravenous dynamic CT or magnetic resonance imaging were performed. The 730-day cumulative developments of vascularization in hypointense, isointense, and hyperintense lesions were 17%, 30%, and 40%, respectively. The differences among these developments were not statistically significant. answer: The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.	no
question: Does confined placental mosaicism account for adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies? context: IVF singletons have poorer perinatal outcomes than singletons from spontaneous conceptions. This may be due to the influence of ovarian stimulation on the chromosomal constitution of the embryos which could be translated into localized chromosomal anomalies in the placenta. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of confined placental mosaicism (CPM) in IVF/ICSI pregnancies and spontaneous conceptions. We conducted a multi-centre retrospective analysis of karyotype results obtained by chorionic villus sampling (CVS), performed due to advanced maternal age (>or=36 years at 18 weeks of gestation), in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2005. From a total of 322 246 pregnancies, 20 885 CVS results were analysed: 235 in the IVF/ICSI group and 20 650 in the control group. The mean age of women in both groups was 38.4 years (mean difference -0.08, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.18). Data relating to the fetal karyotype were missing in 143 cases in the control group. When taking into account missing data, the incidence of CPM was lower in the IVF-ICSI group than in the control group, 1.3% versus 2.2% (odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.19-1.85), whereas the incidence of fetal chromosomal anomalies was increased 4.3% versus 2.4% (odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 0.95-3.42). Neither differences were statistically significant. answer: The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.	no
question: Do elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger ones? context: The increasingly older population confronts oncologists with an imposing challenge: older cancer patients have specific healthcare needs both independent of and associated with the diagnosis of cancer. The aim of the present study is to examine whether elderly versus younger cancer patients have different needs with respect to attendance, treatment and information. This is an observational and cross-sectional study. Cancer patients aged 35 to 82 years were consecutively interviewed. The group was divided into two subgroups aged ≤65 and ≥66 years old. The Needs Evaluation Questionnaire (NEQ) was used to assess patients' needs and demographic variables were collected. Data analysis was carried out by means of cross-tabulation analyses and the chi-square test. The requests most frequently expressed by the older group concerned financial-insurance information (73.9%), the need to talk to people with the same illness (71.7%), the need to receive more comprehensible information from doctors and nurses (71.7%), and the need for a better dialogue with clinicians (69.6%). Few significant differences between the two age subgroups were found, with the exception of issues such as the need for intimacy and support. answer: Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.	no
question: Does increased nerve length within the treatment volume improve trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery? context: To test the hypothesis that increasing the nerve length within the treatment volume for trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery would improve pain relief. Eighty-seven patients with typical trigeminal neuralgia were randomized to undergo retrogasserian gamma knife radiosurgery (75 Gy maximal dose with 4-mm diameter collimators) using either one (n = 44) or two (n = 43) isocenters. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 1-36). Pain relief was complete in 57 patients (45 without medication and 12 with low-dose medication), partial in 15, and minimal in another 15 patients. The actuarial rate of obtaining complete pain relief (with or without medication) was 67.7% +/- 5.1%. The pain relief was identical for one- and two-isocenter radiosurgery. Pain relapsed in 30 of 72 responding patients. Facial numbness and mild and severe paresthesias developed in 8, 5, and 1 two-isocenter patients vs. 3, 4, and 0 one-isocenter patients, respectively (p = 0.23). Improved pain relief correlated with younger age (p = 0.025) and fewer prior procedures (p = 0.039) and complications (numbness or paresthesias) correlated with the nerve length irradiated (p = 0.018). answer: Increasing the treatment volume to include a longer nerve length for trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery does not significantly improve pain relief but may increase complications.	no
question: Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent? context: The records of 465 patients with an established diagnosis of age related macular degeneration who had attended a specialist macular clinic between 1990 and 1998 were scrutinised. A full clinical examination and standardised refraction had been carried out in 189 of these cases on a minimum of two occasions. Cases were looked for where an improvement of one or more lines of either distance or near acuity was recorded in the eye unaffected by macular disease. In each one of these cases the improvement in visual acuity could not be attributed to treatment of other existing pathology. 12 such cases were detected. In nine of these the eye showing improvement of acuity had a history of amblyopia. The mean improvement in distance and near acuity in amblyopic eyes by 12 months was 3.3 and 1.9 lines logMAR respectively. The improvement in acuity generally occurred between 1 and 12 months from baseline and remained stable over the period of follow up. answer: Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.	no
question: Are physicians meeting the needs of family caregivers of the frail elderly? context: To explore expressed needs, both formal and informal, of family caregivers of frail elderly. To evaluate roles of physicians. Questionnaire survey of members of the Montreal Jewish community providing care for frail elderly family members. Jewish community of Montreal. Volunteer caregivers who were caring for a family member or friend 60 years or older, who had greatest responsibility for providing physical or emotional support to an elderly person, who saw themselves as caregivers, and who could speak English or French were studied. Of 118 volunteers, 32 were excluded because they withdrew for personal reasons or because they did not meet study criteria. Demographic variables, functional status of the care receiver, use of home care services, and needs assessment to identify additional services. An average of 75.4% respondents did not use formal support services. Just under half of caregivers were dissatisfied with the attention they received from the health care system, and more than one third expressed feelings of stress, depression, guilt, and isolation. answer: Hypotheses for this discontent are presented. Physicians may be uninterested in helping caregivers; even if they were receptive to counseling caregivers, they could be poorly remunerated for the types of counseling sessions that are usual for caregivers; and being a professional caregiver to family caregivers is demanding in itself.	no
question: Will CT ordering practices change if we educate residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure? context: The aim of this study was to determine if educating residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure from computed tomographic (CT) imaging alters ordering patterns. This study also explored whether referring physicians are interested in radiation education and was an initial effort to address their CT ordering behavior. Two to four months after a radiologist's lecture on the potential effects of radiation exposure related to CT scans, urology and orthopedic residents were surveyed regarding the number and types of CT scans they ordered, the use of alternative imaging modalities, and whether they used the lecture information to educate patients. Twenty-one resident lecture attendants completed the survey. The number of CT scans ordered after the lecture stayed constant for 90% (19 of 21) and decreased for 10% (two of 21). The types of CT scans ordered changed after the lecture for 14% (three of 21). Thirty-three percent (seven of 21) reported increases in alternative imaging after the lecture, including 24% (five of 21) reporting increases in magnetic resonance imaging and 19% (four of 21) reporting increases in ultrasound. Patients directed questions about radiation exposure to 57% (12 of 21); 38% (eight of 21) used the lecture information to educate patients. Referring physicians were interested in the topic, and afterward, other physician groups requested radiation education lectures. answer: Most clinicians did not change their CT scan ordering after receiving education about radiation from a radiologist. Radiation education allowed clinicians to discuss CT benefits and risks with their patients and to choose appropriate CT protocols. Referring physician groups are interested in this topic, and radiologists should be encouraged to give radiation lectures to them.	no
question: Is arch form influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy? context: Orthodontic patients show high prevalence of tooth-size discrepancy. This study investigates the possible association between arch form, clinically significant tooth-size discrepancy, and sagittal molar relationship. Pretreatment orthodontic casts of 230 Saudi patients were classified into one of three arch form types (tapered, ovoid, and square) using digitally scanned images of the mandibular arches. Bolton ratio was calculated, sagittal molar relationship was defined according to Angle classification, and correlations were analyzed using ANOVA, chi-square, and t-tests. No single arch form was significantly more common than the others. Furthermore, no association was observed between the presence of significant Bolton discrepancy and the sagittal molar relationship or arch form. Overall Bolton discrepancy is significantly more prevalent in males. answer: Arch form in a Saudi patient group is independent of gender, sagittal molar relationship, and Bolton discrepancy.	no
question: Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through? context: The transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) is becoming the most popular procedure in the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD), but overstretching of the anal sphincters remains a critical issue that may impact the continence. This study examined the long-term outcome of TERPT versus conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for HD. Records of 41 patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40: 0 to 10, excellent; 11 to 20 good; 21 to 30 fair; 31 to 40 poor. A 2-tailed Student t test, analysis of covariance, as well as logistic and linear regression were used to analyze the collected data with confidence interval higher than 95%. Overall scores were similar. However, continence score was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group. A significant difference in age at interview between the 2 groups was noted; we therefore reanalyzed the data controlling for age, and this showed that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between groups. answer: Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.	no
question: Should temperature be monitorized during kidney allograft preservation? context: It is generally considered that kidney grafts should be preserved at 4 degrees C during cold storage. However, actual temperature conditions are not known. We decided to study the temperature levels during preservation with the Biotainer storage can and Vitalpack transport pack. Temperature was monitored using the Thermobouton probe during preservation of pig kidneys, in the same conditions used with human grafts. The probe recorded the temperature level every 10 minutes during four days. We compared the results found with the new storage can with results obtained in the same conditions with the storage can formerly used by our team. We also studied the best position of the probe for temperature monitoring and the influence of the amount of ice within the transport pack on the temperature level. We then monitored the temperature during the conservation of actual human kidney grafts harvested at our institution from August 2007 to May 2008. The temperature levels were the same regardless of the position of the probe within the transport pack. The lowest temperature was maintained during 15 hours, and the temperature level stayed below 5 degrees C for 57 hours with the new storage can. The former storage can maintained the lowest temperature level for 80 minutes, and temperature reached 5 degrees C after 10 hours 40 minutes. Temperature levels were similar when 2 or 4 kg of crushed ice were used. We observed similar results when monitoring the conservation of human grafts. answer: The new storage can affords more stable temperature levels when compared to the formerly used can. Since temperature is stable during conservation, continuous monitoring in everyday practice does not seem warranted.	no
question: Should all human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with end-stage renal disease be excluded from transplantation? context: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients have generally been excluded from transplantation. Recent advances in the management and prognosis of these patients suggest that this policy should be reevaluated. To explore the current views of U.S. transplant centers toward transplanting asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, a written survey was mailed to the directors of transplantation at all 248 renal transplant centers in the United States. All 148 responding centers said they require HIV testing of prospective kidney recipients, and 84% of these centers would not transplant an individual who refuses HIV testing. The vast majority of responding centers would not transplant a kidney from a cadaveric (88%) or a living donor (91%) into an asymptomatic HIV-infected patient who is otherwise a good candidate for transplantation. Among the few centers that would consider transplanting an HIV-infected patient, not a single center had performed such a transplant in the year prior to the survey. Most centers fear that transplantation in the face of HIV infection would be harmful to the individual, and some believe that it would be a waste of precious organs. answer: The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.	no
question: Does minimal access major surgery in the newborn hurt less? context: Minimal access surgery (MAS) in adults is associated with less postoperative pain in comparison to conventional 'open' surgery. It is not known whether this holds true for neonates as well. Less pain would imply that opioid consumption can be reduced, which has a beneficial effect on morbidity.AIM: To evaluate potential differences in' opioid consumption between neonates undergoing thoracoscopic minimal access surgery or conventional surgery of esophageal atresia (EA) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). In this retrospective cohort study we included two controls for each MAS patient, matched on diagnosis, sex and age at surgery. Opioid dose titration was based on validated pain scores (VAS and COMFORT behaviour), applied by protocol. Cumulative opioid doses at 12, 24, 48 h and 7 days postoperatively were compared between groups with the Mann-Whitney test. The study group consisted of 24 MAS patients (14 EA; 10 CDH). These were matched to 48 control patients (28 EA; 20 CDH). At none of the time points cumulative opioid (median in mg/kg (IQR)) doses significantly differed between MAS patients and controls, both with CDH and EA. For example at 24 h postoperative for CDH patients cumulative opioid doses were [0.84(0.61-1.83) MAS vs. 1.06(0.60-1.36) p=1.0] controls, For EApatients at 24 h the cumulative opioid doses were [0.48(0.30-0.75) MAS vs. 0.49(0.35-0.79) p=0.83] controls. This held true for the postoperative pain scores as well. answer: Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.	no
question: Does increased patient awareness improve accrual into cancer-related clinical trials? context: Oncology literature cites that only 2% to 4% of patients participate in research. Up to 85% of patients are unaware that clinical trials research is being conducted at their treatment facility or that they might be eligible to participate. It was hypothesized that patients' satisfaction with information regarding clinical trials would improve after targeted educational interventions, and accruals to clinical trials would increase in the year following those interventions. All new patients referred to the cancer center over a 4-month period were mailed a baseline survey to assess their knowledge of clinical research. Subsequently, educational interventions were provided, including an orientation session highlighting clinical trials, a pamphlet, and a reference to a clinical trials Web site. A postintervention survey was sent to the responders of the initial survey 3 months after the initial mailing. Patient satisfaction with information significantly increased after the interventions. There was no increase in subsequent enrollment in clinical trials. Patients who indicated an inclination to participate in clinical trials tended to have greater satisfaction with the information they received. answer: A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.	no
question: Continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department: are trainees learning complete surgical care? context: It is widely accepted that exemplary surgical care involves a surgeon's involvement in the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative periods. In an era of ever-expanding therapeutic modalities available to the vascular surgeon, it is important that trainees gain experience in preoperative decision-making and how this affects a patient's operative and postoperative course. The purpose of this study was to define the current experience of residents on a vascular surgery service regarding the continuity of care they are able to provide for patients and the factors affecting this experience. This prospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and conducted at the University of British Columbia during January 2005. All patients who underwent a vascular procedure at either of the two teaching hospitals were included. In addition to type of case (emergent, outpatient, inpatient), resident demographic data and involvement in each patient's care (preoperative assessment, postoperative daily assessment, and follow-up clinic assessment) were recorded. Categoric data were analyzed with the chi2 test. The study included 159 cases, of which 65% were elective same-day admission patients, 20% were elective previously admitted patients; and 15% were emergent. The overall rate of preoperative assessment was 67%, involvement in the decision to operate, 17%; postoperative assessment on the ward, 79%; and patient follow-up in clinic, 3%. The rate of complete in-hospital continuity of care (assessing patient pre-op and post-op) was 57%. Emergent cases were associated with a significantly higher rate of preoperative assessment (92% vs 63%, P<.05). For elective cases admitted before the day of surgery compared with same-day admission patients, the rates of preoperative assessment (78% vs 58%, P<.05) and involvement in the decision to operate (16% vs 4%, P<.05) were significantly higher. answer: The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.	no
question: Health habits and vaccination status of Lebanese residents: are future doctors applying the rules of prevention? context: There has never been a nationally representative survey of medical students' personal health-related practices, although they are inherently of interest and may affect patient-counseling practices. This study evaluated the health practices and the vaccination status of first year residents working at the academic hospital Hôtel-Dieu de France. The medical files of all medicine and surgery residents in their first year of specialization between the years 2005 and 2008 were reviewed. These residents were required to go through a preventive medical visit at the University Center of Family and Community Health. One hundred and nine residents (109) were included in the study; 68 (6239%) were male and 41 (37.61%) were female with a mean age of 26 years. Only 6 residents (5.50%) practiced physical activity according to international guidelines (more than three times a week for more than 30 minutes each time). Most residents (n = 76 ; 69.73%) used to skip one or two meals especially breakfast and as a consequence 30 male (44.11%) and 4 female (9.75%) students were overweight, with a statistical difference between the two sexes (Fisher test, p-value = 0.001). Twenty-eight residents (25.69%) were smokers with a male predominance. Fourteen residents of both genders (12.84%) drank alcohol regularly (>3 times a week) and 71 (65.14%) had a drink occasionally (once a month or less). Only 25 residents (23%) of the cohort had a complete and up-to-date immunization status. The immunization gap was basically against measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis (dT Polio). Ninety-nine residents (90.83%) had full immunization against hepatitis B with an adequate response in 78 residents (71.56%). answer: This study showed that our residents did not always have a healthy lifestyle especially when it comes to physical activity and eating habits. They also lacked an adequate vaccination. Interventions should take place in order to promote healthy life style and to improve their vaccination status.	no
question: Landolt C and snellen e acuity: differences in strabismus amblyopia? context: Assessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between LR and SE. answer: Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.	no
question: The insertion allele of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism. A candidate gene for insulin resistance? context: The insertion/deletion (ID) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD), although the mechanism of this association is not apparent. We tested the hypothesis that the deletion allele of the ACE gene is associated with insulin resistance. We related ACE genotype to components of the insulin-resistance syndrome in 103 non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) and 533 nondiabetic white subjects. NIDDM subjects with the DD genotype had significantly lower levels of specific insulin (DD 38.6, ID 57.1, and II 87.4 pmol.L-1 by ANOVA, P = .011). Non-insulin-treated subjects with the DD genotype had increased insulin sensitivity by HOMA % (DD 56.4%, II 29.4%, P = .027) and lower levels of des 31,32 proinsulin (DD 3.3, II 7.6 pmol.L-1, P = .012) compared with II subjects. There were no differences in prevalence of CHD or levels of blood pressure, serum lipids, or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity between the three ACE genotypes. In nondiabetic subjects there were no differences in insulin sensitivity, levels of insulin-like molecules, blood pressure, PAI-1, serum lipids, or CHD prevalence between the three ACE genotypes. answer: We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.	no
question: Is fetal gender associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy? context: To investigate if fetal gender (1) affects the risk of having an emergency department (ED) visit for asthma; and (2) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had at least one visit to the ED for asthma during pregnancy. We linked two provincial administrative databases containing records on in-patient deliveries and ED visits. The study sample included women who delivered a live singleton baby between April 2003 and March 2004. Pregnant women who made at least one ED visit for asthma were counted as cases and the rest of the women as control subjects. We performed a multivariable analysis using logistic regression to model the risk of having an ED visit for asthma, with fetal gender being one of the predictors. In addition, a series of multivariable logistic regressions were also constructed separately for cases and controls for the following adverse delivery outcomes: low birth weight baby, preterm delivery, and delivery via Caesarian section. Among 109,173 live singleton deliveries, 530 women had visited ED due to asthma during pregnancy. While having an ED visit for asthma was positively associated with teenage pregnancy, low income, and presence of pregnancy-induced hypertension, it was not associated with fetal gender (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.19). Fetal gender was not a significant predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma ED visit during pregnancy. answer: Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.	no
question: Blunt trauma in intoxicated patients: is computed tomography of the abdomen always necessary? context: Physical examination to detect abdominal injuries has been considered unreliable in alcohol-intoxicated trauma patients. Computed tomography (CT) plays the primary role in these abdominal evaluations. We reviewed medical records of all blunt trauma patients admitted to our trauma service from January 1, 1992, to March 31, 1998. Study patients had a blood alcohol level>or =80 mg/dL, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, and unremarkable abdominal examination. Of 324 patients studied, 317 (98%) had CT scans negative for abdominal injury. Abdominal injuries were identified in 7 patients (2%), with only 2 (0.6%) requiring abdominal exploration. A significant association was found between major chest injury and abdominal injury. answer: The incidence of abdominal injury in intoxicated, hemodynamically stable, blunt trauma patients with a normal abdominal examination and normal mentation is low. Physical examination and attention to clinical risk factors allow accurate abdominal evaluation without CT.	no
question: Risk factors for avascular necrosis of bone in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: is there a role for antiphospholipid antibodies? context: Avascular necrosis of bone (AVN) is a well known complication in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To investigate the role of antiphospholipid antibody status (IgM and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant) with adjustment for corticosteroid use as risk factors for the development of AVN. A cohort of 265 patients receiving long term follow up in our SLE clinic from 1978 to 1998 was analysed. Patients with AVN complications were detected and then matched for age, sex, ethnicity, duration of disease, and organ disease with two other patients with SLE. A further 31 patients were chosen at random for the analysis. Eleven patients had AVN, giving a point prevalence of 4%. There were no significant differences demonstrable in the presence of individual antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) or their combination between the group with AVN or the two control groups. answer: Incorporating an adjustment for corticosteroid use we were unable to show a link between the presence of aPL and the development of AVN in patients with SLE.	no
question: Volume change of uterine myomas during pregnancy: do myomas really grow? context: To estimate changes in uterine myoma volume during pregnancy. Review of departmental electronic perinatal database and medical records. Canadian Task Force Classification II-3. Obstetrical ultrasound unit in an academic tertiary care center. One hundred-seven patients diagnosed with uterine myomas during pregnancy and who had two or more obstetrical ultrasounds in different periods of pregnancy. We analyzed the change in volume of uterine myomas between the first half of pregnancy (up until 19 weeks), third quarter (20-30 weeks), and last quarter (31 weeks to term). The volume of largest uterine myoma was calculated using the formula Volume (mm3)=Pi/6x(length mm)x(width mm)x(height mm). The mean age of the population was 31+/-6 years. Between the first and the second study periods, the percentage of uterine myomas that decreased in size was 55.1% (95% CI: 43-66), with a mean decrease in volume of 35%+/-4%; while the percentage of uterine myomas that enlarged was 44.9% (95% CI: 34-56), with a mean increase in volume of 69%+/-11%. Between the second and the third study periods, 75% (95% CI: 56-87) became smaller, with a mean decrease in volume of 30%+/-3%; while 25% (95% CI: 13-43) enlarged, with a mean increase in volume of 102%+/-62%. answer: Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.	no
question: Do foreign bodies migrate through the body towards the heart? context: Fixation of foreign bodies (FB), in the mucosa, can favor its migration, giving origin to the popular saying: 'FB walk to the heart'.AIM: Describe the mechanisms involved in FB migration and how to diagnose them. From a sample of 3,000 foreign bodies, during 40 years, we analyzed four which had extra-lumen migration. We analyzed clinical, radiologic, endoscopic and ultrasound data collected at the medical documentation service. Three clinical histories are presented, describing two fish bones and one piece of fish cartilage. FB shifting was analyzed in all of them. Migration started in the esophagus in two, one going to the aorta and the other to the neck area. In the other two, migration started in the pharynx, and the FB moved towards the prevertebral fascia and the other externalized in the submandibular region. The mechanisms and the risks posed to the patient, by FB migration, and the way to diagnose them are hereby discussed. answer: The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.	no
question: Does concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence? context: Midurethral sling (MUS) can improve overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. It is unclear if anterior/apical prolapse (AA) repair provides additional benefit. We hypothesized that women with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) experience greater improvement in the OAB component of their symptoms after concomitant MUS and AA repair compared with MUS alone. This is a retrospective cohort study of women with bothersome MUI (defined by objective stress test and validated questionnaire) undergoing MUS alone ("MUS-only") or concomitant MUS and AA repair ("MUS + AA"). Our primary outcome was the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Severity (OAB-q SS) change score 6 weeks after surgery. Of 151 women, 67 (44 %) underwent MUS-only and 84 (56 %) underwent MUS + AA. The MUS-only cohort was younger and had less severe baseline prolapse (p < 0.05 for both). Postoperative complications (predominantly UTI) occurred in 35 (23 %) patients and were similar between cohorts. For all subjects mean OAB-q SS scores significantly improved postoperatively (p < 0.05). Our primary outcome, OAB-q SS change score, showed no significant differences between cohorts (30 ± 26 MUS-only vs 25 ± 25 MUS + AA, p = 0.20), indicating similar improvements in OAB symptoms. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed no difference in OAB-q SS change score between cohorts; however, OAB-q SS change scores were lower for women with a postoperative complication (β = -19, 95 % CI -31 to -6; p < 0.01). answer: In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.	no
question: Is hypoalbuminemia an independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer? context: Studies have indicated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with decreased survival of patients with gastric cancer. However, the prognostic value of albumin may be secondary to an ongoing systemic inflammatory response. The aim of the study was to assess the relation between hypoalbuminemia, the systemic inflammatory response, and survival in patients with gastric cancer. Patients diagnosed with gastric carcinoma attending the upper gastrointestinal surgical unit in the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow between April 1997 and December 2005 and who had a pretreatment measurement of albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were studied. Most of the patients had stage III/IV disease and received palliative treatment. The minimum follow-up was 15 months. During follow-up, 157 (72%) patients died of their cancer. On univariate analysis, stage (p<0.001), treatment (p<0.001), albumin level (p<0.001), and CRP level (p<0.001) were significant predictors of survival. On multivariate analysis, stage (p<0.001), treatment (p<0.001), and CRP level (p<0.001) remained significant predictors of survival. Albumin was no longer an independent predictor of survival. answer: Low albumin concentrations are associated with poorer survival in patients with gastric cancer. However, the strength of this relation with survival is dependent on the presence of a systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by an elevated CRP level. Therefore, it appears that the relation between hypoalbuminemia and poor survival is secondary to that of the systemic inflammatory response.	no
question: Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? context: Anchoring vignettes are brief texts describing a hypothetical character who illustrates a certain fixed level of a trait under evaluation. This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan. We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual. The prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity. answer: Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.	no
question: Can the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp predict a neoplastic polyp? context: Cholecystectomy for GB polyps that are larger than 10 mm is generally recommended because of the high probability of neoplasm. In contrast, a follow-up strategy is preferred for GB polyps smaller than 10 mm. However, there are no treatment guidelines for polyps that grow in size during the follow-up period.STUDY: We retrospectively investigated 145 patients with GB polyps who underwent at least 1 ultrasonographic follow-up examination over an interval greater than 6 months, before cholecystectomy at Samsung medical center, South Korea, from 1994 to 2007. The growth rate was determined based on the change in size per time interval between 2 ultrasonographic examinations (mm/mo). The median age of the patients was 48 years (range: 25 to 75). One hundred twenty-five non-neoplastic polyps and 20 neoplastic polyps were found. Neoplastic polyps were more frequently found in patients older than 60 years, those with hypertension, a polyp size greater than 10 mm, and a rapid growth rate greater than 0.6 mm/mo. On multivariate analysis, however, the growth rate was not related to the neoplastic nature of a polyp, but older age (>60 y) and large size (>10 mm) were significantly associated with neoplastic polyps. answer: Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.	no
question: Preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer: is there a place for magnetic resonance imaging? context: The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer. This study had Institutional Review Board approval, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS. All images were analysed blind, and the results were compared with histopathological findings according to the seventh edition of the TNM classification. After the population had been divided on the basis of the local invasion (T1-3 vs T4a-b) and nodal involvement (N0 vs N+), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated and diagnostic performance measures were assessed using the McNemar test. For T staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (94%) than MDCT and MRI (65 and 76%; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08). MDCT and MRI had significantly higher specificity (91 and 89%) than EUS (60%) (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.003). Adding MRI to MDCT or EUS did not result in significant differences for sensitivity. For N staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (92%) than MRI and MDCT (69 and 73%; p = 0.01 and p = 0.02). MDCT showed better specificity (81%) than EUS and MRI (58 and 73%; p = 0.03 and p = 0.15). answer: Our prospective study confirmed the leading role of EUS and MDCT in the staging of gastric cancer and did not prove, at present, the value of the clinical use of MRI.	no
question: Are hepatitis G virus and TT virus involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease? context: Hepatitis G virus can cause chronic infection in man but the role of this agent in chronic liver disease is poorly understood. Little is known about the relation of another newly discovered agent, the TT virus, with chronic liver disease.AIM: To investigate the rate of infection with hepatitis G virus and TT virus in patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease. A total of 23 subjects with chronically raised alanine transaminase and a liver biopsy in whom all known causes of liver disease had been excluded, and 40 subjects with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. Evaluation of anti-hepatitis G virus by enzyme immunoassay. Hepatitis G virus-RNA by polymerase chain reaction with primers from the 5' NC and NS5a regions. TT virus-DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction with primers from the ORF1 region. Results. Hepatitis G virus-RNA was detected in 4 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis and in 6 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis (17.4% vs 15% p=ns). At least one marker of hepatitis G virus infection (hepatitis G virus-RNA and/or anti-hepatitis G virus, mostly mutually exclusive) was present in 6 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic hepatitis and 16 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus liver disease (26. 1% vs 40% p=ns). T virus-DNA was present in serum in 3 subjects, 1 with cryptogenic and 2 with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. Demographic and clinical features, including stage and grade of liver histology, were comparable between hepatitis G virus-infected and uninfected subjects. Severe liver damage [chronic hepatitis with fibrosis or cirrhosis) were significantly more frequent in subjects with hepatitis C virus liver disease. answer: In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.	no
question: Are patients with Werlhof's disease at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery? context: It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients. Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria. Mean number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018). On the day before, directly after and on the first day after surgery they were 141/nl vs. 215/nl (P=0.012), 75/nl vs. 147/nl (P=0.001) and 93/nl vs. 136/nl (P=0.009). Accordingly, patients of the WD-group received significantly more platelet concentrates than patients of the no-WD-group (mean number of platelet concentrates: 2.3 versus 0.7, P=0.007). Total drainage loss via the mediastinal chest tubes was almost identical (1197 ml in the no-WD-group and 1140 ml in the WD-group). One patient of each group suffered from a bleeding complication requiring reexploration. Three patients of the no-WD-group (6%) and one patient of the WD-group (10%) expired postoperatively unrelated to WD. answer: Patients with WD may possibly undergo cardiac surgery without a markedly enhanced risk for bleeding complications despite a more than usual transfusion requirement and significantly lower platelet counts perioperatively.	no
question: Does Mammographic Density have an Impact on the Margin Re-excision Rate After Breast-Conserving Surgery? context: Limited and conflicting data exist on an association between mammographic density (MD) and re-excision rates after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Additionally, the correlation of MD with resection of unnecessary margins during initial BCS is unknown. All women with a diagnosis of breast cancer from 2003 to 2012 and enrolled in a larger study on MD were evaluated. Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine margin resection and involvement. Mammographic density was determined both by breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) classification and by an automated software program (Volpara Solutions). Additional margins were deemed unnecessary if the lumpectomy specimen margin was free of invasive tumor [≥2 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] or if further re-excision was needed. Of 655 patients, 398 (60.8%) had BCS, whereas 226 (34.5%) underwent initial mastectomy. The women with denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than the women with less dense breasts (40.0 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0118). Of the patients with BCS, 166 (41.7%) required separate re-excision. Additional margins were taken during BCS in 192 (48.2%) patients, with 151 (78.6%) proving to be unnecessary. In the bivariable analysis, the patients with denser breasts according to BI-RADS classification and volumetric density showed a trend toward requiring more frequent re-excision, but this association was not seen in the multivariable analysis. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. In the multivariate analysis, the re-excision rates increased with DCIS (p<0.0003) and decreased with resection of additional margins (p = 0.0043). answer: Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.	no
question: Are UK radiologists satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse? context: A list of telephone numbers of UK hospitals with a radiology department was obtained from the Royal College of Radiologists. One hundred hospitals were then randomly selected for inclusion in the survey. An 18-item questionnaire was successfully administered to consultant radiologists from 84 departments. Sixty-one percent of departments had a named radiologist to report their skeletal surveys, 16% assigned surveys to a random radiologist, and 23% referred them elsewhere. Only 52% of departments had a dedicated paediatric radiologist, thus in a significant proportion of departments (25%) initial reports on skeletal surveys for physical abuse were provided by non-paediatric radiologists. Fifteen percent did not have ready access to a paediatric radiology opinion. Sixty-one percent thought that the service could be improved. Expert evidence was provided by 5% of respondents. Seventy-three percent would never consider providing expert evidence, even if given adequate radiology and/or legal training. answer: The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.	no
question: Do oblique views add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents? context: Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique lumbar spine radiographs are often a standard part of the evaluation of children who are clinically suspected of having spondylolysis. Recent concerns regarding radiation exposure and costs have brought the value of oblique radiographs into question. The purpose of the present study was to determine the diagnostic value of oblique views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. Radiographs of fifty adolescents with L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis and fifty controls were retrospectively reviewed. All controls were confirmed not to have spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scanning. Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered. Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement were assessed on the basis of the percentage of overall agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). PCXMC software was used to generate effective radiation doses. Study charges were determined from radiology billing data. There was no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view radiographs in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. The sensitivity was 0.59 for two-view studies and 0.53 for four-view studies (p = 0.33). The specificity was 0.96 for two-view studies and 0.94 for four-view studies (p = 0.60). Inter-rater agreement, intra-rater agreement, and agreement with gold-standard ICC values were in the moderate range and also demonstrated no significant differences. Percent overall agreement was 78% for four-view studies and 82% for two-view studies. The radiation effective dose was 1.26 mSv for four-view studies and 0.72 mSv for two-view studies (difference, 0.54 mSv). The charge for four-view studies was $145 more than that for two-view studies. answer: There is no difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view studies. Although oblique views have long been considered standard practice by some, our data could not identify a diagnostic benefit that might outweigh the additional cost and radiation exposure.	no
question: The clinical significance of bile duct sludge: is it different from bile duct stones? context: Some patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones are found to have sludge and no stones. Although sludge in the gallbladder is a precursor of gallbladder stones, the significance of bile duct sludge (BDS) is poorly defined. This study aimed to compare BDS with bile duct stones in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy. The study enrolled 228 patients who underwent therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected choledocholithiasis. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with BDS but no stones on ERCP and patients with CBD stones. The presence of risk factors for bile duct stones (age, periampullary diverticulum, ductal dilation or angulation, previous open cholecystectomy) were assessed at ERCP. Follow-up data (36 +/- 19 months) were obtained from medical records and by patient questioning. Bile duct sludge occurred in 14% (31/228) of patients and was more common in females. After endoscopic clearance, CBD stones recurred in 17% (33/197) of the patients with CBD stones, and in 16% (5/31) of the patients with BDS (p = 0.99). Common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group. The other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones (age, previous open cholecystectomy, bile duct angulation, and the presence of a peripampullary diverticulum) were not statistically different between the two groups. answer: The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.	no
question: Can bedside assessment reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke? context: To investigate the ability of a bedside swallowing assessment to reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke. Consecutive patients admitted within 24 h of stroke onset to two hospitals. A prospective study. Where possible, all patients had their ability to swallow assessed on the day of admission by both a doctor and a speech and language therapist using a standardized proforma. A videofluoroscopy examination was conducted within 3 days of admission. 94 patients underwent videofluoroscopy; 20 (21%) were seen to be aspirating, although this was not detected at the bedside in 10. In 18 (22%) of the patients the speech and language therapist considered the swallow to be unsafe. In the medical assessment, 39 patients (41%) had an unsafe swallow. Bedside assessment by a speech and language therapist gave a sensitivity of 47%, a specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 85% for the presence of aspiration. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify the optimum elements of the bedside assessments for predicting the presence of aspiration. A weak voluntary cough and any alteration in conscious level gave a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 72%, PPV of 41% and NPV of 91% for aspiration. answer: Bedside assessment of swallowing lacks the necessary sensitivity to be used as a screening instrument in acute stroke, but there are concerns about the use of videofluoroscopy as a gold standard. The relative importance of aspiration and bedside assessment in predicting complications and outcome needs to be studied.	no
question: Does frozen section alter surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease? context: Frozen section (FS) evaluation during thyroid surgery is often used to guide intraoperative management. We sought to determine the utility of FS in patients undergoing thyroidectomy for multinodular thyroid disease. From May 1994 through November 2004, 236 patients with multinodular goiter underwent thyroidectomy at our institution. Patient data were retrospectively analyzed to see if a frozen section was performed during the procedure and whether it changed the patient's outcome. Of the 236 patients, 135 (57%) had intra-operative FS. There were no differences between patients who had FS analysis and those who did not with regard to age, gender, and the incidence of malignancy. Of the patients who had FS, 4/135 (3%) were subsequently diagnosed with thyroid cancer on permanent histology. Three of these FS were misread as benign. Therefore, the sensitivity of FS for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer was only 25%. Importantly, in none of the 135 patients did FS alter the intraoperative management. answer: While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.	no
question: Does type 1 diabetes mellitus affect Achilles tendon response to a 10 km run? context: Achilles tendon structure deteriorates 2-days after maximal loading in elite athletes. The load-response behaviour of tendons may be altered in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) as hyperglycaemia accelerates collagen cross-linking. This study compared Achilles tendon load-response in participants with T1DM and controls. Achilles tendon structure was quantified at day-0, day-2 and day-4 after a 10 km run. Ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC) measures tendon structural integrity by classifying pixels as echo-type I, II, III or IV. Echo-type I has the most aligned collagen fibrils and IV has the least. Participants were 7 individuals with T1DM and 10 controls. All regularly ran distances greater than 5 km and VISA-A scores indicated good tendon function (T1DM = 94 ± 11, control = 94 ± 10). There were no diabetic complications and HbA1c was 8.7 ± 2.6 mmol/mol for T1DM and 5.3 ± 0.4 mmol/mol for control groups. Baseline tendon structure was similar in T1DM and control groups - UTC echo-types (I-IV) and anterior-posterior thickness were all p > 0.05. No response to load was seen in either T1DM or control group over the 4-days post exercise. answer: Active individuals with T1DM do not have a heightened Achilles tendon response to load, which suggests no increased risk of tendon injury. We cannot extrapolate these findings to sedentary individuals with T1DM.	no
question: Are higher rates of depression in women accounted for by differential symptom reporting? context: The gender difference in prevalence and incidence rates of depression is one of the most consistent findings in psychiatric epidemiology. We sought to examine whether any gender differences in symptom profile might account for this difference in rates. This study was a population-based 13-year follow-up survey of community-dwelling adults living in East Baltimore in 1981. Subjects were the continuing participants of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program. Participants interviewed between 1993 and 1996 with complete data on depressive symptoms and covariates were included (n = 1727). We applied structural equations with a measurement model for dichotomous data (the MIMIC-multiple indicators, multiple causes-model) to compare symptoms between women and men, in relation to the nine symptom groups comprising the diagnostic criteria for major depression, adjusting for several potentially influential characteristics (namely, age, self-reported ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, and employment). There were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms even taking into account the higher level of depressive symptoms of women and the influence of other covariates. For example, women were no more likely to endorse sadness than were men, as evidenced by a direct effect coefficient that was not significantly different from the null [adjusted estimated direct effect of gender on report of sadness = 0.105, 95% confidence interval (-0.113, 0.323)]. answer: Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.	no
question: Do Indigenous Australians age prematurely? context: To assess whether Indigenous Australians age prematurely compared with other Australians, as implied by Australian Government aged care policy, which uses age 50 years and over for population-based planning for Indigenous people compared with 70 years for non-indigenous people. Cross-sectional analysis of aged care assessment, hospital and health survey data comparing Indigenous and non-indigenous age-specific prevalence of health conditions. Analysis of life tables for Indigenous and non-indigenous populations comparing life expectancy at different ages. At age 63 for women and age 65 for men, Indigenous people had the same life expectancy as non-indigenous people at age 70. There is no consistent pattern of a 20-year lead in age-specific prevalence of age-associated conditions for Indigenous compared with other Australians. There is high prevalence from middle-age onwards of some conditions, particularly diabetes (type unspecified), but there is little or no lead for others. answer: The idea that Indigenous people age prematurely is not well supported by this study of a series of discrete conditions. The current focus and type of services provided by the aged care sector may not be the best way to respond to the excessive burden of chronic disease and disability of middle-aged Indigenous people.	no
question: Adjuvant radiation of stage III thymoma: is it necessary? context: The criteria for administration of adjuvant radiation therapy after thymoma resection remains controversial, and it is unclear whether patients with Masaoka stage III thymoma benefit from adjuvant radiation. The goal of this report was to determine whether or not this group benefits from radiation therapy in disease-specific survival and disease-free survival. Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed from 1972 to 2004. One hundred and seventy-nine patients underwent resection for thymoma, of which 45 had stage III disease. Forty-five stage III patients underwent resection and in 36 it was complete. Thirty-eight stage III patients received radiation therapy. Baseline prognostic factors between radiated and nonradiated groups were similar. The addition of adjuvant radiotherapy did not alter local or distant recurrence rates in patients with stage III thymoma. Disease-specific survival at 10 years in stage III patients who did not receive radiation was 75% (95% confidence interval, 32% to 100%) and in patients who did receive radiation therapy it was 79% (95% confidence interval, 64% to 94%) (p = 0.21). The most common site of relapse was the pleura. answer: Most patients who have stage III thymoma undergo complete resection. Some patients enjoy prolonged disease-free survival without adjuvant radiation after resection of stage III thymoma. Radiation does not seem to prevent pleural recurrences when given after resection of stage III thymomas. The use of routine adjuvant radiation after a complete resection of stage III thymoma needs to be re-addressed. There may be a role for the use of chemotherapy to reduce pleural recurrences.	no
question: Are patients with diabetes receiving the same message from dietitians and nurses? context: The purpose of this study was to determine if registered dietitian (RD) and registered nurse (RN) certified diabetes educators (CDEs) provide similar recommendations regarding carbohydrates and dietary supplements to individuals with diabetes. A survey was mailed to CDEs in the southern United States. Participants were asked to indicate their recommendations for use of carbohydrates, fiber, artificial sweeteners, and 12 selected dietary and herbal supplements when counseling individuals with diabetes. The survey sample consisted of 366 CDEs: 207 were RNs and 159 were RDs. No statistically significant differences were found between RNs and RDs in typical carbohydrate recommendations for treatment of diabetes. However, RDs were more likely than RNs to make recommendations for fiber intake or use of the glycemic index. A significant difference also was found in the treatment of hypoglycemia: RNs were more likely than RDs to recommend consuming a carbohydrate source with protein to treat hypoglycemia. answer: Although some differences existed, RD and RN CDEs are making similar overall recommendations in the treatment of individuals with diabetes.	no
question: Do lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking confer equal risk of myocardial infarction in women as in men? context: Studies on coronary risk factors in men and women are mainly based on mortality data and few compare results of both sexes with consistent study design and diagnostic criteria. This study assesses the major risk factors for coronary events in men and women from the Reykjavik Study. Within a prospective, population-based cohort study individuals without history of myocardial infarction were identified and the relative risk of baseline variables was assessed in relation to verified myocardial infarction or coronary death during follow-up. Of the 9681 women and 8888 men who attended risk assessment from 1967-1991, with follow-up period of up to 28 years, 706 women and 1700 men suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death. Serum cholesterol was a significant risk factor for both sexes, with hazard ratios (HR) decreasing with age. Systolic blood pressure was a stronger risk factor for women as was ECG-confirmed left ventricular hypertrophy (women HR 2.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-5.01; men HR 1.11 [CI 0.86-1.43]). Fasting blood glucose>or =6.7 mmol/L identified significantly higher risk for women (HR 2.65) than men (HR 2.08) as did self-reported diabetes. Triglyceride risk was significantly higher for women and decreased significantly with age. Smoking increased risk two- to five-fold, increasing with dose, for women, which was significantly higher than the doubling in risk for men. answer: This large study of the major risk factors compared between the sexes demonstrates similar relative risk of myocardial infarction associated with cholesterol for both sexes, however, the relative risk is higher in women for many other risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, elevated triglycerides and left ventricular hypertrophy.	no
question: Diabetes mellitus among Swedish art glass workers--an effect of arsenic exposure? context: The purpose of this study was to search for evidence of an association between occupational arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus, as implied by the relation of this disease to arsenic in drinking water in a recent study from Taiwan. A case-referent analysis on death records of 5498 individuals in the art glass producing part of southeastern Sweden was performed. Out of all the enrolled subjects, 888 were glass workers. According to occupational title, glassblowers, foundry workers, and unspecified workers were regarded as potentially exposed to arsenic. Persons with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus either as an underlying or contributing cause of death were considered cases. Referents were decedents without any indication of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. A slightly elevated risk [Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (MH-OR) 1.2, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.82-1.8] was found for diabetes mellitus among the glassworks employees, especially in combination with cardiovascular disease (MH-OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.81-2.3). For the glassblowers, other foundry workers and unspecified glassworkers probably exposed to arsenic, the M-H odds ratio was 1.4 (95% CI 0.92-2.2). Unspecified glass workers, who probably included persons with high exposure, carried the higher risk (MH-OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.8). answer: The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.	no
question: Preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. Does PET/CT really add something to multidetector CT? context: This study was designed to determine prospectively whether the systematic use of PET/CT associated with conventional techniques could improve the accuracy of staging in patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. We also assessed the impact on the therapeutic strategy. Between 2006 and 2008, 97 patients who were evaluated for resection of LMCRC were prospectively enrolled. Preoperative workup included multidetector-CT (MDCT) and PET/CT. In 11 patients with liver steatosis or iodinated contrast allergy, MR also was performed. Sixty-eight patients underwent laparotomy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values for hepatic and extrahepatic staging of MDCT and PET-CT were calculated. In a lesion-by-lesion analysis of the hepatic staging, the sensitivity of MDCT/RM was superior to PET/CT (89.2 vs. 55%, p < 0.001). On the extrahepatic staging, PET/CT was superior to MDCT/MR only for the detection of locoregional recurrence (p = 0.03) and recurrence in uncommon sites (p = 0.016). New findings in PET/CT resulted in a change in therapeutic strategy in 17 patients. However, additional information was correct only in eight cases and wrong in nine patients. answer: PET/CT has a limited role in hepatic staging of LMCRC. Although PET-CT has higher sensitivity for the detection of extrahepatic disease in some anatomic locations, its results are hampered by its low PPV. PET/CT provided additional useful information in 8% of the cases but also incorrect and potentially harmful data in 9% of the staging. Our findings support a more selective use of PET/CT, basically in patients with high risk of local recurrence.	no
question: Epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis: a risky technique? context: To study the risks of haemodynamic instability, and the possible occurrence of spinal haematoma, meningitis and epidural abscess when epidural analgesia is performed for cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). We retrospectively analyzed the data of 35 patients treated by HIPEC with oxaliplatin or cisplatin. An epidural catheter was inserted before induction of general anaesthesia. Postoperatively, a continuous epidural infusion of ropivacain, then a patient-controlled epidural analgesia were started. The epidural catheter was used peroperatively before HIPEC in 12 subjects (34%), and after HIPEC in 23 subjects (66%). The median dose of ropivacain given peroperatively in the epidural catheter was 40 mg (30-75). Norepinephrin was used in two subjects (6%) peroperatively (median infusion rate 0.325 μg/kg per minute [0.32-0.33]), and in four subjects (11%) in the postoperative 24 hours. No spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess were noted. Five subjects (14%) had a thrombopenia or a prothrombin time less than 60% before catheter removal. Two subjects (6%) had a leukopenia before catheter removal. No thrombopenia or blood coagulation disorders were recorded the day of catheter removal. answer: In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.	no
question: Do acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol affect aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension? context: Increased aortic stiffness is a independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. Acute changes of the heart rate (HR) have been reported not to affect the aortic stiffness in pacing. However, it is unknown whether acute changes in HR caused by sympathomimetics can affect the aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension. We investigated the effect of acute changes in HR produced by isoproterenol on the aortic stiffness in 17 hypertensive patientss (mean age: 59 +/- 9 years). All vasoactive drugs were discontinued at least 3 days before the study. The carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by the foot-to-foot method. The pulse waves were recorded at the baseline and at every increase of HR by 5 to 10 bpm with a gradual increase of the dose of isoproterenol. The blood pressures and HR were measured simultaneously. For the analysis, HR, PWV, compliance (C), and compliance index (Ci) were converted as percent changes (delta) from the baseline values. Percent changes of the parameters of the aortic stiffness, i.e., deltaPWV, deltaC, and deltaCi, were grouped by every 10% increase in deltaHR. There was no significant difference among groups in deltaPWV, deltaC and deltaCi (p>0.05 for each of the group). The regression analysis showed no significant correlation of deltaHR with deltaPWV and deltaC (r = 0.18, 0.13 respectively, p>0.05 for each). deltaCi had a poor correlation with deltaHR (r = 0.22, p<0.05). However, only 4.6% of deltaCi could be referred to deltaHR (r2 = 0.046). answer: Aortic stiffness was not affected by acute changes in HR produced by isoproterenol which suggests that it is not necessary to consider acute changes in HR when measuring aortic PWV.	no
question: Totally implantable venous access device placement by interventional radiologists: are prophylactic antibiotics necessary? context: To determine the rate of early infection for totally implantable venous access devices (TIVADs) placed without antibiotic prophylaxis. A list of patients who underwent TIVAD placement in 2009 was obtained from the patient archiving and communication system (PACS). This list was cross-referenced to all patients who underwent TIVAD removal from January 1, 2009, through January 30, 2010, to identify TIVADs that were removed within 30 days of placement. Retrospective chart review was performed to record patient demographics, including age, sex, cancer diagnosis, and indication for removal. Concurrent antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, and laboratory data before and within 30 days of placement were recorded. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) were identified using U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. There were 1,183 ports placed and 13 removed. CLABSIs occurred in seven (0.6%) patients within 30 days of placement. At the time of TIVAD placement, 81 (7%) patients were receiving antibiotics incidental to the procedure. One patient who received an antibiotic the day of implantation developed a CLABSI. Chemotherapy was administered to 148 (13%) patients on the day of placement. answer: The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.	no
question: Does increasing blood pH stimulate protein synthesis in dialysis patients? context: Although the mechanism of muscle wasting in end-stage renal disease is not fully understood, there is increasing evidence that acidosis induces muscle protein degradation and could therefore contribute to the loss of muscle protein stores of patients on hemodialysis, a prototypical state of chronic metabolic acidosis (CMA). Because body protein mass is controlled by the balance between synthesis and degradation, protein loss can occur as result of either increased breakdown, impaired synthesis, or both. Correction of acidosis may therefore help to maintain muscle mass and improve the health of patients with CMA. We evaluated whether alkalizing patients on hemodialysis might have a positive effect on protein synthesis and on nutritional parameters. Eight chronic hemodialysis patients were treated daily with oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) supplementation for 10-14 days, yielding a pre-dialytic plasma bicarbonate concentration of 28.6 +/-1.6 mmol/l. The fractional synthesis rates (FSR) of muscle protein and albumin were obtained by the L-[(2)H(5)ring]phenylalanine flooding technique. Oral NaHCO(3 )supplementation induced a significant increase in serum bicarbonate (21.5 +/- 3.4 vs. 28.6 +/- 1.6 mmol/l; p = 0.018) and blood pH (7.41 vs. 7.46; p = 0.041). The FSR of muscle protein and the FSR of albumin did not change significantly (muscle protein: 2.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.5% per day, p = 0.39; albumin: 8.3 +/- 2.2 vs. 8.6 +/- 2.5% per day, p = 0.31). Plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 decreased significantly (33.4 +/- 21.3 vs. 25.4 +/- 12.3 nmol/l; p = 0.028), whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxin and free triiodothyronine did not change significantly and nutritional parameters showed no improvement. answer: In contrast to other findings, raising the blood pH of dialysis patients was not associated with a positive effect on albumin and muscle protein synthesis, or nutritional and endocrinal parameters.	no
question: Necrotizing fasciitis: an indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy? context: The accepted treatment protocol for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) consists of extensive surgery and wide spectrum antibiotics. Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving patient mortality and outcome. However, the beneficial effect of HBO for NF remains controversial. A retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone. The two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation. The mortality rate among the HBO-treated patients was 36%, as opposed to 25% in the non-HBO group. The mean number of surgical débridements required per patient was significantly higher in the HBO group: 3.3 compared with 1.5 in the non-HBO-treated patients. Although the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter for the HBO group, the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance. answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.	no
question: MR arthrography of the shoulder: do we need local anesthesia? context: To assess pain intensity with and without subcutaneous local anesthesia prior to intraarticular administration of contrast medium for magnetic resonance arthrography (MRa) of the shoulder. This single-center study was conducted after an IRB waiver of authorization, between January 2010 and December 2012. All patients provided written, informed consent for the procedure. Our prospectively populated institutional database was searched, based on our inclusion criteria. There were 249 outpatients (178 men and 71 women; mean age, 44.4 years ± 14.6; range, 15-79) who underwent MRa and were enrolled in this study. Patients were excluded if they had received surgery of the shoulder before MRa, had undergone repeated MRa of the same shoulder, and/or had undergone MRa of both shoulders on the same day. Patients were randomly assigned into one of three groups. Patients in group A (n=61) received skin infiltration with local anesthesia. Patients in control group B (n=92) and group C (n=96) did not receive local anesthesia. Pain levels were immediately assessed after the injection for MRa using a horizontal visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 to 10. To compare the pain scores of the three groups for male and female patients, a two-way analysis of variance was used. A p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant result. Patients who received local anesthesia (group A) showed a mean pain level on the VAS of 2.6 ± 2.3. In patients who did not receive local anesthetics (groups B and C), a mean pain level on the VAS of 2.6 ± 2.2 and 2.7 ± 2.4 were detected, respectively. Between the three groups, no statistically significant difference in pain intensity was detected (p=.960). There were significant differences in subjective pain perception between men and women (p=.009). Moreover, the sex difference in all three groups was equal (p=.934). answer: Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.	no
question: Prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness - does it inevitably progress to Meniere's disease? context: To investigate whether low-tone SD was a precursor of Meniere's disease and whether patients with low-tone SD suffered from endolymphatic hydrops. This was a retrospective case review in the university hospital. A total of 184 patients with low-tone SD were divided into two groups with single and recurrent episodes. The progress, follow-up audiograms, and ECochG results of the patients were reviewed and compared with those of patients with high-tone SD and Meniere's disease. In all, 83 of 177 patients with low-tone SD unaccompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; 15 of the 83 developed vertiginous attacks. The remaining 94 patients had a single episode. Three of the seven patients with low-tone SD accompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; two of the three were subsequently confirmed to have Meniere's disease. The other four had a single episode. No difference in rate of progress from SD to Meniere's disease was observed among the low-tone and the high-tone SD groups. The average -SP/AP of each group with a single episode is smaller than that of other groups with recurrent episodes and Meniere's disease. answer: We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.	no
question: Is there a relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation? context: Ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) may require adjunctive methods of substrate modification. Both ablation-targeting complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during AF and fractionated electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm (sinus rhythm fractionation [SRF]) have been described. However, the relationship of CFAEs with SRF is unclear. Twenty patients (age 62 ± 9 years, 13 males) with persistent AF and 9 control subjects without organic heart disease or AF (age 36 ± 6 years, 4 males) underwent detailed CFAE and SRF left atrial electroanatomic maps. The overlap in left atrial regions with CFAEs and SRF was compared in the AF population, and the distribution of SRF was compared among patients with AF and normal controls. Propagation maps were analyzed to identify the activation patterns associated with SR fractionation. SRF (338 ± 150 points) and CFAE (418 ± 135 points) regions comprised 29% ± 14% and 25% ± 15% of the left atrial surface area, respectively. There was no significant correlation between SRF and CFAE maps (r = .2; P = NS). On comparing patients with AF and controls, no significant difference was found in the distribution of SRF between groups (P = .74). Regions of SRF overlapped areas of wave-front collision 75% ± 13% of the time. answer: (1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.	no
question: Is bicompartmental knee arthroplasty more favourable to knee muscle strength and physical performance compared to total knee arthroplasty? context: Bicompartmental knee arthroplasty features bone and ligament sparing as unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and is presumably better in the recovery of muscle strength and function compared to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) though not previously reported in the literature. The aim of the study was to compare isokinetic knee muscle strength and physical performance in patients who underwent either bicompartmental knee arthroplasty or TKA. Each of 24 patients (31 knees) was prospectively examined preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after each surgery. Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength as well as position sense were measured using the Biodex system. Timed up and go test, stair climbing test, and the 6-min walk test were used to assess physical performance. The results of each group were also compared with those from the corresponding healthy control, respectively. Demography showed significant difference in the mean age between bicompartment (54.8 ± 5.6 years) and TKA groups (65.7 ± 6.7 years). Comparing between the two groups, knee extensor and flexor torque, hamstring/Quadriceps ratio, position sense, and physical performance were not significantly different preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after surgery. In intra-group analysis, muscle strength and position sense at each time point were not different in both groups. In physical performance, both groups resulted in improvement in the 6-min walk test, and only TKA group showed enhancement in stair climbing test. answer: Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.	no
question: Does pain intensity predict a poor opioid response in cancer patients? context: A secondary analysis of one-hundred-sixty-seven patients referred for treatment of cancer-related pain was conducted. Pain intensity at admission was recorded and patients were divided in three categories of pain intensity: mild, moderate and severe. Patients were offered a treatment with opioid dose titration, according to department policy. Data regarding opioid doses and pain intensity were collected after dose titration was completed. Four levels of opioid response were considered: (a) good pain control, with minimal opioid escalation and without relevant adverse effects; (b) good pain control requiring more aggressive opioid escalation, for example doubling the doses in four days; (c) adequate pain control associated with the occurrence of adverse effects; (d) poor pain control with adverse effects. Seventy-six, forty-four, forty-one and six patients showed a response a, b, c, and d, respectively. No correlation between baseline pain intensity categories and opioid response was found. Patients with response 'b' and 'd' showed higher values of OEImg. answer: Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.	no
question: Does the radiographic transition zone correlate with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease? context: The correlation between radiographic transition zone on contrast enema in Hirschsprung's disease and the total length of aganglionosis is known to be inaccurate. The aim of our study was to analyse this correlation more precisely to improve preoperative planning of the corrective surgery. From 1998 to 2009, 79 patients were operated on for Hirschsprung's disease. All available preoperative contrast enemas (n = 61) had been single blind reviewed by the same radiologist who defined the radiographic transition zone when present in vertebral level. Four groups were determined (rectal, rectosigmoid, long segment, and absence of transition zone) and by Kappa coefficient of agreement correlated to the length of aganglionosis in the pathological report. Radiological findings were concordant with the specimen in pathology in 8 cases of 19 in rectal form (42 %), in 20 cases of 35 in rectosigmoid form (57 %), in all 6 cases of long-segment form (100 %), in the 2 cases of total colonic form (100 %) with a global agreement of 58.1 %, κ = 0.39 CI [0.24; 0.57]. answer: Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.	no
question: Serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: does it exist? context: To determine whether the host immune response to gonorrhoea provides limited serovar specific protection from reinfection. 508 episodes of gonorrhoea diagnosed at a city centre genitourinary medicine clinic including 22 patients with multiple infections over a 4 year period. Patients with recurrent gonococcal infection were analysed with respect to the initial and subsequent serovars isolated. No significant difference was seen in the prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection compared with those without repeat infections. The site of the initial infection did not appear to influence the subsequent serovar isolated. answer: We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.	no
question: Is calibration the cause of variation in liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry testosterone measurement? context: Testosterone measurement by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is well accepted as the preferred technique for the analysis of testosterone. Variation is seen between assays and this may be due to differences in calibration as commercial calibrators for this assay are not readily available. We investigated the effects calibration in routine clinical LC-MS/MS assays. All LC-MS/MS users that were registered with the UKNEQAS external quality assurance scheme for testosterone were invited to take part in the study. A set of seven serum samples and serum-based calibrators were sent to all laboratories that expressed an interest. The laboratories were instructed to analyse all samples using there own calibrators and return the results and a method questionnaire for analysis. Fifteen laboratories took part in the study. There was no consensus on supplier of testosterone or matrix for the preparation of calibrators and all were prepared in-house. Also, a wide variety of mass spectrometers, internal standards, chromatography conditions and sample extractions were used. The variation in results did not improve when the results were corrected with a common calibrator. answer: The variation in results obtained could not be attributed to variations in calibrators. The differences in methodologies between laboratories must be the reason for this variation.	no
question: Internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint: is there still a place for ultrasound? context: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of articular sounds, standardized clinical examination, and standardized articular ultrasound in the detection of internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint. Forty patients and 20 asymptomatic volunteers underwent a standardized interview, physical examination, and static and dynamic articular ultrasound. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated using magnetic resonance as the reference test. A total of 120 temporomandibular joints were examined. Based on our findings, the presence of articular sounds and physical signs are often insufficient to detect disk displacement. Imaging by static and dynamic high-resolution ultrasound demonstrates considerably lower sensitivity when compared with magnetic resonance. Some of the technical difficulties resulted from a limited access because of the presence of surrounding bone structures. answer: The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.	no
question: Does delivery mode affect women's postpartum quality of life in rural China? context: To explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of life. Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Cross-sectional study design. Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. The overall caeserean section rate was 70·0% (962/1375), and most of them (59·7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. answer: Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life.	no
question: Endovenous laser ablation in the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins: does site of access influence early outcomes? context: The study was performed to evaluate the clinical and technical efficacy of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of small saphenous varicosities, particularly in relation to the site of endovenous access. Totally 59 patients with unilateral saphenopopliteal junction incompetence and small saphenous vein reflux underwent EVLA (810 nm, 14 W diode laser) with ambulatory phlebectomies. Small saphenous vein access was gained at the lowest site of truncal reflux. Patients were divided into 2 groups: access gained above mid-calf (AMC, n = 33) and below mid-calf (BMC, n = 26) levels. Outcomes included Venous Clinical Severity Scores (VCSS), Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), patient satisfaction, complications, and recurrence rates. Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in VCSS, AVVQ, generic quality of life Short Form 36, and EuroQol scores (P<.05) up to 1 year. No differences were seen between AMC and BMC groups for complications (phlebitis: 2 [6%] and 1 [3.8%], P>.05; paresthesia: 2 [6%] and 5 [19%], P = .223) and recurrence (3 [9%] and 1 [3.8%], P = .623), respectively. answer: The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.	no
question: Is there a role for fondaparinux in perioperative bridging? context: A possible role for fondaparinux as a bridging agent in the perioperative setting is explored. Anticoagulation guidelines provide minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients. answer: The role of fondaparinux in perioperative bridge therapy has not been established, and there are some important limitations to its use as a routine bridging agent.	no
question: Is it better to be big? context: Swedish hospital mergers seem to stem from a conviction among policy makers that bigger hospitals lead to lower average costs and improved clinical outcomes. The effects of mergers in the form of multisited hospitals have not been systematically evaluated. The purpose of this article is to contribute to this area of knowledge by exploring responses to the merger of Blekinge Hospital. The evaluation was guided by the philosophy of triangulation. A questionnaire was sent to 597 randomly selected employees, that is 24% of the health care staff. Four hundred ninety-eight employees answered the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 83%. Furthermore, interviews of different groups of stakeholders were conducted. A moderate increase of quality was assessed, which, a low proportion of the employees perceived had decisively or largely to do with the merger. The majority perceives economical incentives as the drivers of change, but, at the same time, only 10% of this group believes this target was reached completely or to a large extent. answer: The employees believe the merger has neither generated economy of scale advantages nor substantial quality improvement. Instead, it seems more rewarding to promote cross-functional collaboration together with clinical specialisation. Needs for both integration and differentiation could thereby be fulfilled.	no
question: Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified? context: Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor. Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis. We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment. answer: In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.	no
question: The association of puberty and young adolescent alcohol use: do parents have a moderating role? context: To explore the extent to which parent-adolescent emotional closeness, family conflict, and parental permissiveness moderate the association of puberty and alcohol use in adolescents (aged 10-14). Cross-sectional survey of 7631 adolescents from 231 Australian schools. Measures included pubertal status, recent (30day) alcohol use, parent-adolescent emotional closeness, family conflict, parental permissiveness of alcohol use and peer alcohol use. The analysis was based on a two-level (individuals nested within schools) logistic regression model, with main effects entered first, and interaction terms added second. The interaction of family factors and pubertal stage did not improve the fit of the model, so a main effect model of family factors and pubertal stage was adopted. There were significant main effects for pubertal stage with boys in middle puberty at increased odds of alcohol use, and girls in advanced puberty at increased odds of alcohol use. answer: Puberty and family factors were strong predictors of adolescent alcohol use, but family factors did not account for variation in the association of pubertal stage and alcohol use.	no
question: Does increased use of private health care reduce the demand for NHS care? context: The use of the private sector for health care is increasing, but it is unclear whether this will reduce demand on the NHS. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between private and NHS outpatient referral rates accounting for their association with deprivation. This is a prospective survey of general practitioner referrals to private and NHS consultant-led services between 1 January and 31 December 2001 from 10 general practices in the Trent Focus Collaborative Research Network, United Kingdom. Patient referrals were aggregated to give private and NHS referral rates for each electoral ward in each practice. Of 17,137 referrals, 90.4 percent (15,495) were to the NHS and 9.6 percent (1642) to the private sector. Private referral rates were lower in patients from the most deprived fifth of wards compared with the least deprived fifth (rate ratio 0.25, 95 percent CI 0.15 to 0.41, p<0.001), whereas NHS referral rates were slightly higher in patients in the most deprived fifth of wards (rate ratio 1.18, 95 percent CI 0.98 to 1.42, p = 0.08) both after age standardisation and adjustment for practice. The NHS referral rate was significantly higher (rate ratio 1.40, 95 percent CI 1.15 to 1.71, p = 0.001) in wards with private referral rates in the top fifth compared with the bottom fifth after adjustment for deprivation and practice. answer: Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.	no
question: Is decompressive surgery effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive cervical myelopathy? context: A retrospective multicenter study of series of 12 patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis who underwent surgery. To evaluate the postoperative outcomes of patients with cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive myelopathy and effect of decompressive surgery on the prognosis of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a chronic, multisystem noncaseating granulomatous disease. It is difficult to differentiate spinal cord sarcoidosis from cervical compressive myelopathy. There are no studies regarding the coexistence of compressive cervical myelopathy with cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis and the effect of decompressive surgery. Nagoya Spine Group database included 1560 cases with cervical myelopathy treated with cervical laminectomy or laminoplasty from 2001 to 2005. A total of 12 patients (0.08% of cervical myelopathy) were identified spinal cord sarcoidosis treated with decompressive surgery. As a control subject, 8 patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis without compressive lesion who underwent high-dose steroid therapy without surgery were recruited. In the surgery group, enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were mostly seen at C5-C6, coincident with the maximum compression level in all cases. Postoperative recovery rates in the surgery group at 1 week and 4 weeks were -7.4% and -1.1%, respectively. Only 5 cases had showed clinical improvement, and the condition of these 5 patients had worsened again at averaged 7.4 weeks after surgery. Postoperative oral steroid therapy was initiated at an average of 6.4 weeks and the average initial dose was 54.0 mg in the surgery group, while 51.3 mg in the nonsurgery group. The recovery rate of the Japanese Orthopedic Association score, which increased after steroid therapy, was better in the nonsurgery group (62.5%) than in the surgery group (18.6%) with significant difference (P<0.01). answer: The effect of decompression for spinal cord sarcoidosis with compressive myelopathy was not evident. Early diagnosis for sarcoidosis from other organ and steroid therapy should be needed.	no
question: Does the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites result in serious acute side effects? context: To determine the incidence and severity of acute side effects from the use of polyvalent antivenin in victims of rattlesnake bites. We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who presented with rattlesnake bites to a university teaching hospital during an 11-year period. From patient medical records, we extracted demographic data, clinical measurements, and outcomes during emergency department evaluation and subsequent hospitalization. Data regarding serum sickness were not collected. Primary outcome variables were the occurrence of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to antivenin, the type of reaction, permanent disability at hospital discharge, and mortality. We identified a total of 73 patients with rattlesnake bites during the study period. Bite envenomation was graded as nonenvenomated, 7 patients (10%); mild, 23 patients (32%); moderate, 32 patients (44%); and severe, 11 patients (15%). We identified 65 patients who received antivenin. Antivenin doses ranged from 1 to 30 vials per patient (mean, 12.0 +/- 6.0), for a total of 777 vials. In 43 patients (66%), 10 or more vials of antivenin were given. The mean number of vials of antivenin given to each snakebite grade were as follows: mild, 8.4 (+/-4.0); moderate, 11.8 (+/-5.7); and severe, 18.7 (+/-6.3). No deaths, amputations, or permanent disability from snakebite occurred in the patients receiving antivenin. Acute side effects of antivenin-occurring within the first 6 hours after administration-were seen in 12 patients (18%; 95% confidence interval, 10%-30%). Acute side effects consisted solely of urticaria in all but 1 patient (2%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-8%). This patient had a history of previous antivenin reaction and required a short course of intravenous epinephrine for blood pressure support. No other complications occurred. answer: The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.	no
question: Does successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in improved obstetric practice? context: To determine whether successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme (PEP) improves obstetric practice. The three midwife obstetric units (MOUs) in a health district of Mpumalanga were included in the study. Two MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. answer: Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.	no
question: Can surgeon familiarization with current evidence lead to a change in practice? context: Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence. The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use. Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant. answer: This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.	no
question: Kell alloimmunization in pregnancy: associated with fetal thrombocytopenia? context: Kell haemolytic disease in pregnancies has been suggested to be associated with decreased fetal platelet counts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of fetal thrombocytopenia in pregnancies complicated by Kell alloimmunization. In this retrospective cohort study, fetal platelet counts were performed in 42 pregnancies with severe Kell alloimmunization prior to the first intrauterine blood transfusion. Platelet counts from 318 first intrauterine transfusions in RhD alloimmunized pregnancies were used as controls. Fetal thrombocytopenia (platelet count<150 x 10(9)/l) was found in 4/42 (10%) in the Kell group and in 84/318 (26%) in the RhD group. None of the fetuses in the Kell alloimmunized pregnancies, including 15 with severe hydrops, had a clinically significant thrombocytopenia defined as a platelet count<50 x 10(9)/l. In the RhD alloimmunized pregnancies, 2/230 (1%) of the non-hydropic fetuses and 7/30 (23%) of the severely hydropic fetuses had a clinically significant thrombocytopenia. answer: In contrast to fetuses with severe anaemia and hydrops due to RhD alloimmunization, fetuses with severe anaemia due to Kell alloimmunization are generally not at risk for substantial thrombocytopenia.	no
question: Globulomaxillary cysts--do they really exist? context: The so-called "globulomaxillary cyst", described as a fissural cyst, caused by entrapped epithelium between the nasal and maxillary process, is no longer considered for its own entity. Nevertheless, cystic lesions, which correspond to the previous image of globulomaxillary cysts, do still occur in daily practice. This raises the question to which entities pathological processes in this particular region actually belong to. In a retrospective study, 17 cases (12 men and 5 women, 12-59 years old) of primarily diagnosed globulomaxillary cysts are analysed according to clinical, radiological and histological aspects, catamnestic processed and assigned to a new entity. The results are compared with the international literature and draws conclusions on the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. Seven lateral periodontal cysts, four radicular cysts, two keratocystic odontogenic tumours, one adenomatoid odontogenic tumour, one periapical granuloma, one residual cyst and one undefined jaw cyst were determined. answer: According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.	no
question: Colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases: does global management at the same centre improve results? context: Synchronous liver metastases (SLM) occur in 20% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Resection of SLM and CLC can be undertaken at different centres (separate management, SM) or at the same centre (global management, GM). Retrospective study of SLM and CRC resections carried out during 01/2000 - 12/2006 by SM or GM, using a combined or delayed strategy. Morphologic characteristics and type of CRC and SLM resection were similar for the GM (n = 45) or SM (n = 66) groups. In patients with delayed liver resection (62 SM, 17 GM), chemotherapy prior to liver surgery was used in 92% and 38% of SM and GM patients (P<0.0001) and the median delay between procedures was 212 and 182 days, respectively (P = 0.04). First step of liver resection was more often performed during colorectal surgery in the GM group (62 vs. 6% for SM, P<0.0001) and the mean number of procedures (CRC+SLM) was lower (1.6 vs. 2.3, P = 0.003). Three-month mortality was 3% for GM and 0% for SM (n.s.). Overall survival rates were 67% and 51% for SM and GM at 3 years (n.s.), and 35 and 31% at 5 years (n.s.). Disease-free survival to 5 years was higher in SM patients (14% vs. 11%, P = 0.009). answer: GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.	no
question: Are octogenarians at high risk for carotid endarterectomy? context: Several prospective randomized trials have proved carotid endarterectomy to be safe and effective for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients younger than 80 years of age. Recently, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been approved for use in selected high-risk patients. It has been proposed that being an octogenarian places patients in this high-risk category. All patients between the ages of 80 to 89 years undergoing carotid endarterectomy during a 12-year period were included in the study. Information included indications for carotid endarterectomy, associated risk factors, length of stay, and hospital course. Perioperative morbidity and mortality, including neurologic events and myocardial infarction, were recorded. A total of 103 carotid endarterectomies were performed in 95 octogenarians. Procedures were performed on 59 men and 36 women. Indications for operation included symptomatic carotid stenosis in 44 patients (43%) and asymptomatic carotid stenosis in 59 (57%). Associated risk factors included diabetes mellitus (17%), hypertension (76%), coronary artery disease (28%), hyperlipidemia (39%), and history of smoking (42%). There were 4 perioperative neurologic complications, which included 1 transient ischemic attack (0.97%), 2 minor strokes (1.94%), and 1 major stroke (0.97%). There were no deaths. answer: Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.	no
question: Is there a need for pelvic CT scan in cases of renal cell carcinoma? context: To determine the necessity of pelvic computed tomography (CT) in patients of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We reviewed the records of 400 patients of RCC, who underwent treatment at our institution between January 1988 and February 2001. These patients were evaluated pre-operatively with ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. USG or CT scans of these cases were reviewed for presence of pathology in the pelvis, which were classified into 3 categories viz; benign and likely to be insignificant, benign and likely to be significant; and malignant. Of the 400 cases, 114 were stage I, 68 were stage II, 99 were stage III and 119 were stage IV. In all patients, tumour was identified in the kidney on preoperative CT scan. Fourteen patients (3.5%) had an abnormality on pelvic CT. Five (1.25%) had category 1, three (0.75%) had category 2 and six (1.5%) had category 3 abnormality on pelvic CT. However, all these abnormalities in pelvis were detected prior to CT by other investigations (USG or plain x-ray). Of the six cases with malignant findings, two had superficial bladder cancer, one had RCC in a pelvic kidney and three had bone metastases in the pelvis. answer: Pelvic CT does not offer additional information in the vast majority of cases with RCC and should be performed selectively. Thus the cost of diagnostic imaging in RCC can be reduced.	no
question: Should circumcision be performed in childhood? context: To evaluate prepuce development and retractibility in a group of boys. To point out the value of circumcision and prepucial forced dilation during childhood. Prepuce development and retractibility were evaluated in 400 boys ages between 0-16 year old. In boys under 1 year prepuce retractibility (assessed only in children who did not undergo forced dilation previously) was type I (non retractile) in 71.5% whereas type V (completely retractile) was only 5.5%. In adolescent boys type I prepuce was observed in 1 boy only, 1.6%, whereas type V was observed in 82.3%. Furthermore, it was observed that at the time of examination for the study 106 boys who had undergone forced dilation at an earlier age had balano-prepucial adhesions again, which demonstrates that prepuce adheres again to glans penis in many boys after a forced dilation is performed. Only 11 boys were considered in need for circumcision, three of them for prepucial orifice stenosis, which prevented normal micturition, causing a prepucial sac, one case due to a constrictive ring below the prepucial edge that would have prevented ulterior retractability, two cases with repetitive balanopostitis, and five cases secondary to xerosol balanitis, accounting for 2.7% of all examined boys. answer: Incomplete separation between prepuce and glans penis is normal and common among new-borns, progressing until adolescence to spontaneous separation, at which time it is complete in the majority of boys. Accordingly to the criteria we have sustained for years and present study's findings, circumcision has few indications during childhood, as well as forced prepucial dilation.	no
question: Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection? context: The relationship between the use of an endoscope during ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) procedures and infection remains poorly defined. In this study, we sought to analyze whether the simultaneous use of an endoscope could in fact increase the infection rate associated with VPS procedures. This study included 438 VPS procedures, 49 in which an endoscope was used (11.2%) and 389 in which an endoscope was not used (88.8%). The infection rates in these 2 main groups were calculated and compared. Subsequently, 4 new groups were created, composed of patients with a shunt inserted for the first time (groups 1A and 1B) and patients with a shunt reviewed or inserted for a second time (groups 2A and 2B). Groups 1A and 2A comprised patients in whom an endoscope was used simultaneously with VPS surgery, and groups 1B and 2B comprised patients in whom an endoscope was not used. These groups were compared to determine the infection rate. The overall infection rate was 18.5%, including 22.4% in the groups in which an endoscope was used and 18% in those in which an endoscope was not used (P = 0.449). Groups 1A and 1B and groups 2A and 2B were matched for possible intervening risk factors. The infection rate was 28.6% in group 1A and 16.2% in group 1B (P = 0.27), and 20% in group 2A and 19.8% in group 2B (P = 0.977). answer: In the present study, the use of an endoscope during VPS procedures did not increase the risk of surgical infection.	no
question: Is the probability of prenatal diagnosis or termination of pregnancy different for fetuses with congenital anomalies conceived following assisted reproductive techniques? context: To compare the probability of prenatal diagnosis (PND) and termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA) between fetuses conceived by assisted reproductive techniques (ART) and spontaneously-conceived fetuses with congenital heart defects (CHD). Population-based observational study. Paris and surrounding suburbs. Fetuses with CHD in the Paris registry of congenital malformations and cohort of children with CHD (Epicard). Comparison of ART-conceived and spontaneously conceived fetuses taking into account potential confounders (maternal characteristics, multiplicity and year of birth or TOPFA). Probability and gestational age at PND and TOPFA for ART-conceived versus spontaneously conceived fetuses. The probability of PND (28.1% versus 34.6%, P = 0.077) and TOPFA (36.2% versus 39.2%, P = 0.677) were not statistically different between ART-conceived (n = 171) and spontaneously conceived (n = 4620) fetuses. Estimates were similar after adjustment for potential confounders. Gestational age at PND tended to be earlier for ART fetuses (23.1 versus 24.8 weeks, P = 0.05) but no statistical difference was found after adjustment for confounders. Gestational age at TOPFA was comparable between ART-conceived and spontaneously conceived fetuses. answer: In our population, ART conception was not significantly associated with the probability of PND or TOPFA for CHD. One implication of our results is that live births may be adequate for assessing the overall risk of CHD related to ART. However, total prevalence, in particular of severe CHD, would not be adequately assessed if TOPFA are not included.	no
question: Is There an Additional Value of Using Somatostatin Receptor Subtype 2a Immunohistochemistry Compared to Somatostatin Receptor Scintigraphy Uptake in Predicting Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Response? context: It is unknown whether tumoral somatostatin receptor subtype 2a (sst2a) immunohistochemistry (IHC) has additional value compared to somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) uptake using OctreoScan® in predicting response to peptide receptor radiotherapy using 177Lu-octreotate (PRRT) in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). The aims of this study were: (1) to establish the percentage of sst2a immunopositivity in GEP-NET samples of PRRT-treated patients, (2) to determine the relationship between best GEP-NET response using RECIST 1.0 criteria 1 year after PRRT and tumoral sst2a IHC, and (3) to compare characteristics of patients with sst2a IHC-negative and -positive tumors. All 73 consecutive patients were selected for PRRT based on a positive SRS. Radiological response was scored according to RECIST 1.0 criteria. sst2a status was detected on tumor samples by IHC. In total, 93% of GEP-NET samples showed sst2a IHC positivity. No statistically significant relationship was observed between in vitro sst2a expression and in vivo best GEP-NET response 1 year after PRRT (p = 0.47). Sex, primary tumor site, disease stage, ENETS TNM classification, Ki-67 index, highest serum chromogranin-A level, and highest neuron-specific enolase level were not significantly different between patients with negative and positive sst2a tumoral IHC with the exception of age at diagnosis (p = 0.007). answer: sst2a IHC of tumor samples has no additional value compared to SRS uptake using OctreoScan® in predicting tumor response after PRRT.	no
question: Does growth hormone replacement therapy reduce mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency? context: Adults with GH deficiency (GHD) have a decreased life expectancy. The effect of GH treatment on mortality remains to be established. This nationwide cohort study investigates the effect of GH treatment on all-cause and cause-specific mortality and analyzes patient characteristics influencing mortality in GHD adults. Patients in the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults were retrospectively monitored (1985-2009) and subdivided into treatment (n = 2229), primary (untreated, n = 109), and secondary control (partly treated, n = 356) groups. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated for all-cause, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Expected mortality was obtained from cause, sex, calendar year, and age-specific death rates from national death and population counts. In the treatment group, 95 patients died compared to 74.6 expected [SMR 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.56)]. Mortality was higher in women than in men. After exclusion of high-risk patients, the SMR for CVD mortality remained increased in women. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated. In the control groups mortality was not different from the background population. Univariate analyses demonstrated sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis as influencing factors. answer: GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.	no
question: Can decisional algorithms replace global introspection in the individual causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs? context: In this study, an expert panel assessed causality of adverse reports by using the WHO global introspection (GI) method. The same reports were independently assessed using 15 published algorithms. The causality assessment level 'possible' was considered the lower limit for a report to be considered to be drug related. For a given algorithm, sensitivity was determined by the proportion of reports simultaneously classified as drug related by the algorithm and the GI method. Specificity was measured as the proportion of reports simultaneously considered non-drug related. The analysis was performed for the total sample and within serious or unexpected events. Five hundred adverse reports were studied. Algorithms presented high rates of sensitivity (average of 93%, positive predictive value of 89%) and low rates of specificity (average of 7%, negative predictive value of 31%). answer: Decisional algorithms are sensitive methods for the detection of ADRs, but they present poor specificity. A reference method was not identified. Algorithms do not replace GI and are not definite alternatives in the individual causality assessment of suspected ADRs.	no
question: Sternal skin conductance: a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement? context: This study aims to examine the accuracy of a new sternal skin conductance (SSC) device in measuring hot flashes and to assess the acceptability of the device by women. Three small descriptive pilot studies were performed using two sequential prototypes of the SSC device developed by an engineering device company in the Midwest. The devices were worn either in a monitored setting for 24 hours or in an ambulatory setting for 5 weeks. During the study period, women recorded hot flashes in a prospective hot flash diary and answered questions about the acceptability of wearing the SSC device. The first prototype was not able to collect any analyzable skin conductance data owing to various malfunction issues, including poor conductance and battery failure. However, 16 women wore the device for 5 weeks and reported that wearing the device was acceptable, although 31% stated that it interfered with daily activities. Hot flash data from the second prototype revealed a 24% concordance rate between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. answer: Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.	no
question: Is the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire useful for the screening of partial androgenic deficiency of aging men? context: Androgen serum levels significantly decrease in older men, causing quality of life impairment and increasing the risk of chronic disease. This disorder is defined as PADAM (Partial Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men). To evaluate a PADAM screening tool and determine the prevalence of this disorder in healthy adult men. This was a cross-sectional study in which 96 men aged 40 or more of the South Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile were surveyed with the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire of the Saint Louis University and sampled for the serum determination of total testosterone, sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Also free and bioavailable testosterone were calculated. PADAM was considered present if items 1 or 7 or any 3 other questions of the ADAM questionnaire were positive. An available testosterone of<198.4 ng/dL was used as a gold standard for the diagnosis of PADAM. A total of 78 men (81.3%) were identified as possible PADAM according to the ADAM questionnaire. Total testosterone levels fell from 503.6+/-180.1 ng/dL in men aged 40 to 54 years to 382.1+/-247.3 in those>70 years; however this was not statistically significant (ANOVA, p=0.06). In the same age groups, SHBG significantly increased (31.0+/-15.0 to 47.5+/-15.0 nmol/L, p<0.001) whereas free and available testosterone significantly decreased (10.6+/-3.2 to 6.4+/-3.6 ng/dL and 266.6+/-81.2 to 152.2+/-97.6 ng/dL, respectively, p<0.0001). Overall (n=96), available testosterone confirmed PADAM diagnosis in 27 cases (28.1%). The ADAM tool rendered a 83.3% sensitivity and 19.7% specificity in the detection of PADAM. Item 1 (decreased sexual desire) was a better predictor of hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire (63.3% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity). answer: In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.	no
question: Does a history of unintended pregnancy lessen the likelihood of desire for sterilization reversal? context: Unintended pregnancy has been significantly associated with subsequent female sterilization. Whether women who are sterilized after experiencing an unintended pregnancy are less likely to express desire for sterilization reversal is unknown. This study used national, cross-sectional data collected by the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth. The study sample included women ages 15-44 who were surgically sterile from a tubal sterilization at the time of interview. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between a history of unintended pregnancy and desire for sterilization reversal while controlling for potential confounders. In this nationally representative sample of 1,418 women who were sterile from a tubal sterilization, 78% had a history of at least one unintended pregnancy and 28% expressed a desire to have their sterilization reversed. In unadjusted analysis, having a prior unintended pregnancy was associated with higher odds of expressing desire for sterilization reversal (odds ratio [OR]: 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.79). In adjusted analysis controlling for sociodemographic factors, unintended pregnancy was no longer significantly associated with desire for reversal (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 0.91-2.34). answer: Among women who had undergone tubal sterilization, a prior history of unintended pregnancy did not decrease desire for sterilization reversal.	no
question: Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method? context: The aim of this work is to assess a previously described slit-lamp biomicroscopy-based method (SLBM) for measuring pupil diameter and compare it to Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP). Two examiners performed three repeated measurements with each instrument in 40 healthy eyes. We determined the agreement of SLBM and CIP, intraobserver and interobserver repeatabilities, and interobserver concordance (kappa) and SLBM ability for detecting pupil sizes over 6.0 mm. The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) pupil diameter was 5.81 ± 0.70 mm with SLBM and 6.26 ± 0.68 mm with CIP (p = 0.01) averaging both examiner's results. Mean differences between the SLBM and CIP were -0.60 mm and -0.30 mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings (p = 0.02), and they were very similar using the first reading. Intraobserver reproducibility: the width of the 95% LoA ranged from 1.79 to 2.30 mm. The ICCs were 0.97 and 0.92 for SLBM, and 0.96 and 0.90 for CIP. Interobserver reproducibility: the width of the LoA ranged from 1.82 to 2.09 mm. Kappa statistics were 0.39 and 0.49 for the first and mean SLBM readings, respectively, and 0.45 for both the first and mean CIP readings. Sensitivity and specificity of SLBM for detection of pupils larger than 6 mm ranged from 55.56% to 73.68% and from 76.19% to 95.45%, respectively. The best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity ranged from 5.4 mm to 6.2 mm. answer: Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6 mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.	no
question: Does stress increase imitation of drinking behavior? context: That alcohol consumption is strongly influenced by the drinking behavior of social company has been demonstrated in observational research. However, not everyone is equally vulnerable to other people's drinking, and it is important to unravel which factors underlie these individual differences. This study focuses on the role of psychosocial stress in attempting to explain individual differences in the propensity to imitate alcohol consumption. With a 2 (confederate's drinking condition: alcohol vs. soda) × 2 (participant's stress condition: stress vs. no stress) experimental design, we tested whether the tendency to imitate other people's drinking was related to participants' induced stress levels. The young male adults (N = 106) were randomly assigned to each of the conditions. In each session, directly after the stress or no-stress period, confederates and participants entered a bar laboratory where we observed their drinking behavior. Prior to entering the session, confederates were instructed to drink alcohol or soda. Participants in both stress and no-stress conditions consumed substantially more alcohol when confederates drank alcohol than when they drank soda. There was no difference in alcohol consumed between stress and no-stress conditions. No moderating effect of stress on the tendency to drink along with peers was found. answer: Generally, it appears that among young male adults, imitation of alcohol consumption is a robust phenomenon not dependent on individual stress levels.	no
question: Do clinical variables predict pathologic radiographs in the first episode of wheezing? context: To determine if clinical variables assessed in relation to Albuterol aerosol treatments accurately identify children with pathologic radiographs during their initial episode of bronchospasm. A prospective convenience sample of children with a first episode of wheezing. Data collected included demographics, baseline and post-treatment clinical score and physical examination, number of aerosols, requirement for supplemental oxygen, and disposition. Chest radiographs were obtained and interpreted, and patients were divided into 2 groups based on a pathologic versus nonpathologic radiograph interpretation. Chi2 testing was performed for categoric variables, and the student t test was performed for continuous variables. A discriminant analysis was used to develop a model. Pathologic radiographs were identified in 61 patients (9%). Between groups, a significant difference was noted for pretreatment oxygen saturation only. Clinical score, respiratory rate, and presence of rales both pretreatment and posttreatment were not significantly different between groups. The discriminant analysis correctly predicted 90% of nonpathologic radiographs but only 15% of pathologic radiographs. answer: Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not identify all children with pathologic radiographs.	no
question: Is distance to provider a barrier to care for medicaid patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer? context: Distance to provider might be an important barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment for cancer patients who qualify for Medicaid coverage. Whether driving time or driving distance is a better indicator of travel burden is also of interest. Driving distances and times from patient residence to primary care provider were calculated for 3,917 breast, colorectal (CRC) and lung cancer Medicaid patients in Washington State from 1997 to 2003 using MapQuest.com. We fitted regression models of stage at diagnosis and time-to-treatment (number of days between diagnosis and surgery) to test the hypothesis that travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Later stage at diagnosis for breast cancer Medicaid patients is associated with travel burden (OR = 1.488 per 100 driving miles, P= .037 and OR = 1.270 per driving hour, P= .016). Time-to-treatment after diagnosis of CRC is also associated with travel burden (14.57 days per 100 driving miles, P= .002 and 5.86 days per driving hour, P= .018). answer: Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.	no
question: Laminoplasty outcomes: is there a difference between patients with degenerative stenosis and those with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament? context: Two common causes of cervical myelopathy include degenerative stenosis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). It has been postulated that patients with OPLL have more complications and worse outcomes than those with degenerative stenosis. The authors sought to compare the surgical results of laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical stenosis with myelopathy due to either degenerative changes or segmental OPLL. The authors conducted a retrospective review of 40 instrumented laminoplasty cases performed at a single institution over a 4-year period to treat cervical myelopathy without kyphosis. Twelve of these patients had degenerative cervical stenotic myelopathy ([CSM]; degenerative group), and the remaining 28 had segmental OPLL (OPLL group). The 2 groups had statistically similar demographic characteristics and number of treated levels (mean 3.9 surgically treated levels; p>0.05). The authors collected perioperative and follow-up data, including radiographic results. The overall clinical follow-up rate was 88%, and the mean clinical follow-up duration was 16.4 months. The mean radiographic follow-up rate was 83%, and the mean length of radiographic follow-up was 9.3 months. There were no significant differences in the estimated blood loss (EBL) or length of hospital stay (LOS) between the groups (p>0.05). The mean EBL and LOS for the degenerative group were 206 ml and 3.7 days, respectively. The mean EBL and LOS for the OPLL group were 155 ml and 4 days, respectively. There was a statistically significant improvement of more than one grade in the Nurick score for both groups following surgery (p<0.05). The Nurick score improvement was not statistically different between the groups (p>0.05). The visual analog scale (VAS) neck pain scores were similar between groups pre- and postoperatively (p>0.05). The complication rates were not statistically different between groups either (p>0.05). Radiographically, both groups lost extension range of motion (ROM) following laminoplasty, but this change was not statistically significant (p>0.05). answer: Patients with CSM due to either degenerative disease or segmental OPLL have similar perioperative results and neurological outcomes with laminoplasty. The VAS neck pain scores did not improve significantly with laminoplasty for either group. Laminoplasty may limit extension ROM.	no
question: Do overweight children necessarily make overweight adults? context: To compare growth curves of body mass index from children to adolescents, and then to young adults, in Japanese girls and women in birth cohorts born from 1930 to 1999. Retrospective repeated cross sectional annual nationwide surveys (national nutrition survey, Japan) carried out from 1948 to 2005. Japan. 76,635 females from 1 to 25 years of age. Body mass index. Generally, body mass index decreased in preschool children (2-5 years), increased in children (6-12 years) and adolescents (13-18 years), and slightly decreased in young adults (19-25 years) in these Japanese females. However, the curves differed among birth cohorts. More recent cohorts were more overweight as children but thinner as young women. The increments in body mass index in early childhood were larger in more recent cohorts than in older cohorts. However, the increments in body mass index in adolescents were smaller and the decrease in body mass index in young adults started earlier, with lower peak values in more recent cohorts than in older cohorts. The decrements in body mass index in young adults were similar in all birth cohorts. answer: An overweight birth cohort in childhood does not necessarily continue to be overweight in young adulthood. Not only secular trends in body mass index at fixed ages but also growth curves for wide age ranges by birth cohorts should be considered to study obesity and thinness. Growth curves by birth cohorts were produced by a repeated cross sectional annual survey over nearly six decades.	no
question: Does patient position during liver surgery influence the risk of venous air embolism? context: It is generally believed that positioning of the patient in a head-down tilt (Trendelenberg position) decreases the likelihood of a venous air embolism during liver resection. The physiological effect of variation in horizontal attitude on central and hepatic venous pressure was measured in 10 patients during liver surgery. Hemodynamic indices were recorded with the operating table in the horizontal, 20 degrees head-up and 20 degrees head-down positions. There was no demonstrable pressure gradient between the hepatic and central venous levels in any of the positions. The absolute pressures did, however, vary in a predictable way, being highest in the head-down and lowest during head-up tilt. However, on no occasion was a negative intraluminal pressure recorded. answer: The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.	no
question: Is routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy necessary? context: Pneumothorax following flexible bronchoscopy (FB) with transbronchial biopsy (TBB) occurs in 1 to 6% of cases. Routine chest radiography (CXR) following TBB is therefore requested by most pulmonologists in an attempt to detect complications, particularly pneumothorax. The objective of this study was to determine if routine CXR after bronchoscopy and TBB is necessary. The study group included 350 consecutive patients who underwent FB with TBB at our institution between December 2001 and January 2004. Routine CXR was performed up to 2 h after the procedure in all cases. Additionally, the following information was recorded in all patients: sex, age, immune status, indication for bronchoscopy, total number of biopsies done, segment sampled, pulse oxygen saturation, and development of symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. Pneumothorax was diagnosed radiologically in 10 patients (2.9%). Seven patients had symptoms strongly suggestive of pneumothorax prior to CXR, including four patients with large (>10%) pneumothorax. The other three patients were asymptomatic, with only minimal pneumothorax (</= 10%), which resolved completely 24 to 48 h later. answer: We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.	no
question: Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome? context: Several studies have suggested a protective effect of folic acid (FA) on congenital heart anomalies. Down syndrome (DS) infants are known to have a high frequency of heart anomalies. Not all children with DS suffer from heart anomalies, which raises the question whether maternal factors might affect the risk of these anomalies. Our objectives were to investigate whether first-trimester FA use protects against heart anomalies among DS children. Women with liveborn DS children participating in the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study between 1976 and 1997 were included. We performed case-control analyses using DS, with heart anomalies as cases and DS, without heart anomalies as controls. Subanalyses were performed for defects that have been associated with FA in non-DS populations (conotruncal, ventricular septal [VSD]) and for those that are associated with DS (ostium secundum type atrial septal defects [ASD]and endocardial cushion defects [ECD]). Exposure was defined as the use of any FA-containing product for an average of at least 4 days per week during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, whereas no exposure was defined as no use of FA in these 12 weeks. Of the 223 cases, 110 (49%) were exposed versus 84 (46%) of the 184 controls. After adjustment for possible confounders, no protective effect of FA was found on heart anomalies overall (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.61-1.47) nor separately for conotruncal defects, VSDs, ASDs, or ECDs. answer: Our study does not show a protective effect of FA on heart anomalies among infants with DS.	no
question: Location and number of sutures placed for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding: does it matter? context: It has been demonstrated that hiatal hernia repair (HHR) during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) decreases the rate of reoperation. However, the technical aspects (location and number of sutures) are not standardized. It is unknown whether such technical details are associated with differing rates of reoperation for band-related problems. A retrospective analysis was performed from a single institution, including 2,301 patients undergoing LAGB with HHR from July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. Independent variables were number and location of sutures. Data collected included demographics, operating room (OR) time, length of stay (LOS), follow-up time, postoperative BMI/%EWL, and rates of readmission/reoperation. Statistical analyses included ANOVA and Chi squared tests. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox regression tests were used for follow-up data and reoperation rates, in order to account for differential length of follow-up and confounding variables. There was no difference in length of follow-up among all groups. The majority of patients had one suture (range 1-6; 55 %). Patients with fewer sutures had shorter OR time (1 suture 45 min vs. 4+ sutures 56 min, p<0.0001). LOS, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postop BMI/%EWL were not statistically significant. Anterior suture placement (vs. posterior vs. both) was most common (61 %). OR time was shorter in those with anterior suture (41 min vs. posterior 56 min vs. both 59 min, p<0.0001). Patients with posterior suture had a longer LOS (84 % 1 day vs. anterior 74 % 1 day vs. both 74 % 1 day, p<0.0001). There was no difference in 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative BMI/%EWL. answer: Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.	no
question: Does the distribution of health care benefits in Kenya meet the principles of universal coverage? context: The 58th World Health Assembly called for all health systems to move towards universal coverage where everyone has access to key promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative health interventions at an affordable cost. Universal coverage involves ensuring that health care benefits are distributed on the basis of need for care and not on ability to pay. The distribution of health care benefits is therefore an important policy question, which health systems should address. The aim of this study is to assess the distribution of health care benefits in the Kenyan health system, compare changes over two time periods and demonstrate the extent to which the distribution meets the principles of universal coverage. Two nationally representative cross-sectional households surveys conducted in 2003 and 2007 were the main sources of data. A comprehensive analysis of the entire health system is conducted including the public sector, private-not-for-profit and private-for-profit sectors. Standard benefit incidence analysis techniques were applied and adopted to allow application to private sector services. The three sectors recorded similar levels of pro-rich distribution in 2003, but in 2007, the private-not-for-profit sector was pro-poor, public sector benefits showed an equal distribution, while the private-for-profit sector remained pro-rich. Larger pro-rich disparities were recorded for inpatient compared to outpatient benefits at the hospital level, but primary health care services were pro-poor. Benefits were distributed on the basis of ability to pay and not on need for care. answer: The principles of universal coverage require that all should benefit from health care according to need. The Kenyan health sector is clearly inequitable and benefits are not distributed on the basis of need. Deliberate efforts should be directed to restructuring the Kenyan health system to address access barriers and ensure that all Kenyans benefit from health care when they need it.	no
question: Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data? context: Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression. From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%. answer: No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.	no
question: Can bone thickness and inter-radicular space affect miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites? context: The proper angle of miniscrew insertion is important for cortical anchorage, patient safety, and biomechanical control. The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion. In this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45°, 60°, and 90° in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used. The sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 ± 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships. The inter-radicular space ranged from 2.46 to 3.31 mm, and alveolar bone thickness ranged from 8.01 to 13.77 mm. The thickness tended to decrease with the increase in insertion angle from 45° to 90°. No significant differences between the genders or types of malocclusion were found. answer: The results of this study suggest that the safest areas for the placement of miniscrews are between the first and second premolars and between the first and second molars, regardless of the angle of insertion.	no
question: SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) in patients with essential tremor. Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease? context: The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical grounds alone. In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs. Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals. Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12 months later. answer: Our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, it appears that ET patients have a small degree of striatal dopaminergic degeneration. If this is due to alterations in the nigrostriatl pathway or of other origin it is not clear. Follow-up studies of essential tremor patients are warranted to assess progression of disease and to understand better the possible cause for striatal dopaminergic degeneration.	no
question: Are many colorectal cancers due to missed adenomas? context: An unknown number of colorectal cancers could be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopy. Data in the literature are sparse. A large cross-sectional study was done in a prospective database of all patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. All consecutive endoscopies over a period of 15 years, in which colorectal cancer was diagnosed were included. All patients who underwent more than one endoscopy and in whom ultimately cancer was diagnosed were studied separately. Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 835 patients. Twenty-five patients underwent a previous endoscopy without a cancer diagnosis. These 25 patients were divided into three groups according to the time between the endoscopy in which the cancer was detected and the previous endoscopy. Five out of these 25 patients underwent regular surveillance. Only 11 patients had no argument for regular follow-up. Assuming that these cancers developed from an adenoma than only 11 out of 835 (1.3%) cancers were missed in the adenoma phase. There was no difference in the size of the tumour between the three groups of patients. answer: In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.	no
question: Clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle cell disease: is it accurate enough? context: To determine whether the use of empiric chest radiography (CXR) is of significant value in detecting clinically unsuspected acute chest syndrome (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD presenting to the emergency department and hematology clinic with temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees C were prospectively evaluated using a physician-completed questionnaire. The questionnaire included inquiries into the patient's physical signs and symptoms and the physician's clinical impression for the presence of ACS. The questionnaire was completed before obtaining CXR results in all patients. Seventy-three patients with SCD with 96 febrile events were evaluated over a 1-year period. Twenty-four percent (23/96) of the patients had CXR evidence of ACS. On the basis of the questionnaire data, 61% (14/23) of ACS cases were not clinically suspected by the evaluating physician before obtaining CXR. Comparing the patients with and without ACS revealed that, with the exception of splinting (4/23 [17%] versus 0/73 [0%]), no symptom or physical examination finding helped to identify which patients had ACS. Fifty-seven percent of patients with ACS had completely normal findings on physical examination. The presentation of patients with clinically detected versus clinically unsuspected ACS also did not differ significantly. Length of hospitalization, oxygen use, and need for transfusion were the same in both the unsuspected and detected ACS groups. Overall physician sensitivity for predicting ACS was only 39%, and diagnostic accuracy did not improve significantly with increasing levels of pediatric training. answer: ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.	no
question: Can nonproliferative breast disease and proliferative breast disease without atypia be distinguished by fine-needle aspiration cytology? context: Cytologic criteria reported to be helpful in the distinction of proliferative breast disease without atypia (PBD) from nonproliferative breast disease (NPBD) have not been rigorously tested. Fifty-one air-dried, Diff-Quik-stained fine-needle aspirates (FNA) of palpable breast lesions with biopsy-proven diagnoses of NPBD (34 cases) or PBD (17 cases) were reviewed. The smears were evaluated for the cellularity, size, and architectural arrangement of the epithelial groups; the presence of single epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells; and nuclear characteristics. The only cytologic feature found to be significantly different between PBD and NPBD was a swirling pattern of epithelial cells. A swirling pattern was noted in 13 of 17 PBD cases (76%) and 12 of 34 NPBD cases (35%) (P = 0.008). answer: Because there is significant overlap in cytologic features between NPBD and PBD, the distinction between the two entities is difficult in cytologic sampling.	no
question: Is vancomycin MIC creep a worldwide phenomenon? context: Vancomycin is the primary treatment for infections caused by methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis. A total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively. During the 3 year period, we observed a significant fluctuation in the rate of MRSA with a vancomycin MIC > 1 mg/L (2007: 86.2%; 2008: 93.3%; 2009: 58.8%, p = 0.002). No MRSA isolate presented a MIC > 2 mg/L. answer: We were unable to find in our institution data compatible to the presence of vancomycin MIC creep during the study period. This phenomenon seems not to be generalized; as a result each institution should systematically monitor MRSA vancomycin MIC over time.	no
question: Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease? context: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy characterized by villus atrophy and malabsorption of essential nutrients. Vitamin D deficiency has been described in autoimmune diseases, but its status in prepubertal children with CD has not been adequately studied. To determine the vitamin D status of prepubertal children with CD. A retrospective study of prepubertal children aged 3-12 years with CD (n=24) who were compared to prepubertal, non-CD children of the same age (n=50). Children were included in the study if they had a diagnosis of CD by intestinal biopsy, and were not on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients were excluded if they had diseases of calcium or vitamin D metabolism, or were receiving calcium or vitamin D supplementation or had other autoimmune diseases. All subjects had their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level measured. There was no difference in 25(OH)D level between the CD and non-CD children (27.58 +/- 9.91 versus 26.20 +/- 10.45, p = 0.59). However, when the patients were subdivided into obese and non-obese groups, the non-obese CD patients had a significantly higher 25(OH)D level than the obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 21.58 +/- 5.67, p = 0.009). In contrast, there was no difference in 25(OH)D level between non-obese CD patients and non-obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 30.64 +/-12.08, p = 0.52). The season of 25(OH)D measurement was not a significant confounder (p =0.7). answer: Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.	no
question: Is renal warm ischemia over 30 minutes during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy possible? context: To evaluate renal damage and impairment of renal function 1 yr after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) with warm ischemia>30 min. From July 2004 to June 2005, 18 patients underwent LPN with warm ischemia time>30 min. Kidney damage markers (daily proteinuria and tubular enzymes) and renal function (serum creatinine, cystatin C, and creatinine clearances) were assessed on postoperative days 1 and 5 and at 12 mo. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was evaluated before surgery and at 3 mo. Renal scintigraphy was performed before the procedure, at 5 d and at 3 and 12 mo postoperatively. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t test and logistic regression analysis. In terms of kidney damage and renal function markers, the statistical analysis demonstrated that at 1 yr there was complete return to the normal range and no statistical difference between the values at the various time points. The GFR was not significantly different before and 3 mo after surgery. In terms of scintigraphy of the operated kidney, the values were 48.35+/-3.82% (40-50%) before the procedure, 36.88+/-8.42 (16-50%) on postoperative day 5 (p=0.0001), 40.56+/-8.96 (20-50%) at 3 mo (p=0.003), and 42.8+/-7.2% (20-50%) 1 yr after surgery (p=0.001). answer: Our results demonstrate that kidney damage occurs during LPN when warm ischemia is>30 min. This damage is only partially reversible and efforts should be made to keep warm ischemia within 30 min.	no
question: PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy? context: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels can show wide fluctuations when repeatedly measured. Here we investigatewd if: (a) biopsy timing influences the prostate cancer (PC) detection rate in patients with fluctuating PSA (flu-PSA) in comparison with patients with steadily increasing PSA (si-PSA); (b) PSA slope estimated in patients with flu-PSA predicts a different risk of cancer detection; (c) flu-PSA and si-PSA patients develop PC in topographically different sites; (d) the behaviour of pre-operative PSA is an expression of a disease with defferent characteristics to the following radical prostatectomy. The study involved 211 patients who underwent at least a second biopsy after a first negative prostate biopsy. PSA Slope, PSA velocity (PSAV) and PSA doubling time (PSADT) were estimated. Flu-PSA level was defined as a PSA series with at least one PSA value lower than the one immediately preceding it. 82 patients had flu-PSA levels and 129 si-PSA levels. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of cancer detection, clinical or pathological stage, but the si-PSA group with cancer had a higher Gleason score. No difference was found for PSA Slope between flu-PSA patients with cancer and those without. answer: Our study demonstrates no difference in PC detection rate at repeat biopsy between patients with flu or si-PSA levels. PSA Slope, PSAV and PSADT were not found helpful tools in cancer detection.	no
question: Does immediate breast reconstruction compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy? context: Immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) provides psychological benefit to many early breast cancer patients however concerns persist regarding its potential impact on chemotherapy delivery. We investigated the association between IBR, complications and adjuvant chemotherapy delivery. Retrospective analysis of patients in an academic breast service, who underwent mastectomy, with or without reconstruction, and received adjuvant chemotherapy. Comparisons were made between 107 patients who received IBR and 113 who received mastectomy alone. Those receiving IBR were on average younger, with lower body mass index (BMI) and better prognoses. Overall complication rates were comparable (mastectomy alone: 45.1% versus IBR: 35.5%, p = 0.2). There was more return to surgery in the IBR group with 11.5% of tissue expanders requiring removal, whilst more seromas occurred in the mastectomy group. There was no significant difference in the median time to chemotherapy. answer: We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.	no
question: Prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma--is well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early cancer? context: The purpose of this study is to examine whether or not well differentiated (w-d) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is indeed clinically early cancer. Seventy six patients with solitary small HCCs up to 3 cm in diameter, who underwent hepatectomy, were observed for at least 2 years for possible recurrence. These patients were divided into two groups: 10 patients with w-d HCCs (Edmondson and Steiner's grade I) and 66 patients with less differentiated (l-d) HCCs (Edmondson and Steiner's grade I-II, II-III, and III). The histological analysis revealed that w-d HCCs had lower incidences of fibrous capsule formation (P<0.01), when compared to l-d HCCs. There were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic metastasis, or portal vein invasion. In a resected specimen of w-d HCC, barium sulfate and gelatin were injected into portal vein and a transparent specimen was made. The transparent specimen showed that the portal vein in the tumor seemed to be intact. Microscopically, cancer cell infiltration into the fibrous frame of the portal tract was present. There were no significant differences in the disease free survival between the two groups. An analysis of tumor volume doubling time in recurrent foci suggested that minute cancerous foci had been present at the time of operation. answer: W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.	no
question: Does a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program improve bariatric surgery outcomes? context: Many insurance payors mandate that bariatric surgery candidates undergo a medically supervised weight management (MSWM) program as a prerequisite for surgery. However, there is little evidence to support this requirement. We evaluated in a randomized controlled trial the hypothesis that participation in a MSWM program does not predict outcomes after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in a publicly insured population. This pilot randomized trial was conducted in a large academic urban public hospital. Patients who met NIH consensus criteria for bariatric surgery and whose insurance did not require a mandatory 6-month MSWM program were randomized to a MSWM program with monthly visits over 6 months (individual or group) or usual care for 6 months and then followed for bariatric surgery outcomes postoperatively. Demographics, weight, and patient behavior scores, including patient adherence, eating behavior, patient activation, and physical activity, were collected at baseline and at 6 months (immediately preoperatively and postoperatively). A total of 55 patients were enrolled in the study with complete follow-up on 23 patients. Participants randomized to a MSWM program attended an average of 2 sessions preoperatively. The majority of participants were female and non-Caucasian, mean age was 46 years, average income was less than $20,000/year, and most had Medicaid as their primary insurer, consistent with the demographics of the hospital's bariatric surgery program. Data analysis included both intention-to-treat and completers' analyses. No significant differences in weight loss and most patient behaviors were found between the two groups postoperatively, suggesting that participation in a MSWM program did not improve weight loss outcomes for LAGB. Participation in a MSWM program did appear to have a positive effect on physical activity postoperatively. answer: MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.	no
question: Bony defects in chronic anterior posttraumatic dislocation of the shoulder: Is there a correlation between humeral and glenoidal lesions? context: The prevalence of combined humeral and glenoid defects varies between 79 and 84 % in case of chronic posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between humeral and glenoid defects based on quantitative radiological criteria. A retrospective study was performed between 2000 and 2011 including patients who underwent primary surgical shoulder stabilization for chronic posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability, with bone defects in both the glenoid and humerus and a healthy contralateral shoulder. The following measurements were taken: D/R ratio (Hill-Sachs lesion depth/humeral head radius) on an AP X-ray in internal rotation and the D1/D2 ratio [diameter of the involved glenoid articular surfaces (D1)/the healthy one (D2)] on a comparative Bernageau glenoid profile view. Measurements were taken by two observers. Correlations were determined by the Spearman correlation coefficients (r), Bland and Altman diagrams, and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). A sample size calculation was done. Thirty patients were included, 25 men/5 women, mean age 29.8 ± 11.2 years. The mean D/R was 23 ± 12 % for observer 1 and 23 ± 10 % for observer 2. The mean D1/D2 was 95 ± 4 % for observer 1 and 94 ± 6 % for observer 2. No significant correlation was found between humeral and glenoid bone defects by observer 1 (r = 0.23, p = 0.22) or observer 2 (r = 0.05, p = 0.78). Agreement of the observers for the D/R ratio was excellent (ICC = 0.89 ± 0.04, p < 0.00001) and good for the D1/D2 ratio (ICC = 0.54 ± 0.14, p = 0.006). answer: Humeral and glenoid bone defects were not correlated. Inter-observer reliability was excellent for the D/R ratio and good for the D1/D2 ratio.	no
question: Does the bracket-ligature combination affect the amount of orthodontic space closure over three months? context: To investigate the effect of bracket-ligature combination on the amount of orthodontic space closure over three months. Randomized clinical trial with three parallel groups. A hospital orthodontic department (Chesterfield Royal Hospital, UK). Forty-five patients requiring upper first premolar extractions. Informed consent was obtained and participants were randomly allocated into one of three groups: (1) conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and elastomeric ligatures; (2) conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and Super Slick(®) low friction elastomeric ligatures; (3) Damon 3MX(®) passive self-ligating brackets. Space closure was undertaken on 0·019×0·025-inch stainless steel archwires with nickel-titanium coil springs. Participants were recalled at four weekly intervals. Upper alginate impressions were taken at each visit (maximum three). The primary outcome measure was the mean amount of space closure in a 3-month period. A one-way ANOVA was undertaken [dependent variable: mean space closure (mm); independent variable: group allocation]. The amount of space closure was very similar between the three groups (1 mm per 28 days); however, there was a wide variation in the rate of space closure between individuals. The differences in the amount of space closure over three months between the three groups was very small and non-significant (P = 0·718). answer: The hypothesis that reducing friction by modifying the bracket/ligature interface increases the rate of space closure was not supported. The major determinant of orthodontic tooth movement is probably the individual patient response.	no
question: Can increases in the cigarette tax rate be linked to cigarette retail prices? context: To explain China's cigarette pricing mechanism and the role of the Chinese State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) on cigarette pricing and taxation. Published government tobacco tax documentation and statistics published by the Chinese STMA are used to analyse the interrelations among industry profits, taxes and retail price of cigarettes in China. The 2009 excise tax increase on cigarettes in China has not translated into higher retail prices because the Chinese STMA used its policy authority to ensure that retail cigarette prices did not change. The government tax increase is being collected at both the producer and wholesale levels. As a result, the 2009 excise tax increase in China has resulted in higher tax revenue for the government and lower profits for the tobacco industry, with no increase in the retail price of cigarettes for consumers. answer: Numerous studies have found that taxation is one of the most effective policy instruments for tobacco control. However, these findings come from countries that have market economies where market forces determine prices and influence how cigarette taxes are passed to the consumers in retail prices. China's tobacco industry is not a market economy; therefore, non-market forces and the current Chinese tobacco monopoly system determine cigarette prices. The result is that tax increases do not necessarily get passed on to the retail price.	no
question: Attaining negative margins in breast-conservation operations: is there a consensus among breast surgeons? context: The purpose of this survey was to ascertain the most common surgical practices for attaining negative (tumor-free) surgical margins in patients desiring breast-conservation treatment for breast cancer to see if a consensus exists for optimal treatment of patients. We sent a survey to 1,000 surgeons interested in the treatment of breast cancer. Three hundred eighty-one surgeons responded to this survey and 351 were used for the analysis (response rate of 38%). Answers showed a large variety in clinical practices among breast surgeons across the country. There was little intraoperative margin analysis; only 48% of surgeons examine the margins grossly with a pathologist and even fewer used frozen sections or imprint cytology. Decisions to reexcise specific margins varied greatly. For example, 57% of surgeons would never reexcise for a positive deep margin, but 53% would always reexcise for a positive anterior margin. Most importantly, there was a large range in answers about acceptable margins with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma. Fifteen percent of surgeons would accept any negative margin, 28% would accept a 1-mm negative margin, 50% would accept a 2-mm negative margin, 12% would accept a 5-mm negative margin, and 3% would accept a 10-mm negative margin. answer: Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.	no
question: Does the sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery influence distal embolisation? context: Embolisation of atherosclerotic debris during abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is responsible for significant peri-operative morbidity. Reports have suggested that preferential clamping of the distal vessel(s) before the proximal aorta may decrease the number of emboli passing distally and hence reduce complications. Forty patients undergoing AAA repair were randomised to have either first clamping of the proximal aorta or the iliac vessels. Emboli passing through the Superficial Femoral Arteries were detected with a Transcranial Doppler ultrasound system. There was no difference between the two groups in the number of emboli detected (p=0.49) and no significant correlation between number of emboli and dissection time (r=0.0008). However, there was a significantly higher number of emboli in the patient sub-group that were current smokers (p=0.034). answer: There appears to be no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs.	no
question: Discharging patients earlier from Winnipeg hospitals: does it adversely affect quality of care? context: To determine whether decreasing lengths of stay over time for selected diagnostic categories were associated with increased hospital readmission rates and mean number of physician visits after discharge. Retrospective descriptive study. The seven large (125 beds or more) acute care hospitals in Winnipeg. Manitoba residents admitted to any one of the seven hospitals because acute myocardial infarction (AMI), bronchitis or asthma, transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) and uterine or adnexal procedures for nonmalignant disease during the fiscal years 1989-90 to 1992-93. Patients from out of province, those who died in hospital, those with excessively long stays (more than 60 days) and those who were transferred to or from another institution were excluded. Length of hospital stay, and rate of readmission within 30 days after discharge for all four categories and mean number of physician visits within 30 days after discharge for two categories (AMI and bronchitis or asthma. The length of stay decreased significantly over the 4 years for all of the four categories, the smallest change being observed for patients with AMI (11.1%) and the largest for those with bronchitis or asthma (22.0%). The readmission rates for AMI, bronchitis or asthma, and TURP showed no consistent change over the 4 years. The readmission rate for uterine or adnexal procedures increased significantly between the first and second year (chi 2 = 4.28, p = 0.04) but then remained constant over the next 3 years. The mean number of physician visits increased slightly for AMI in the first year (1.92 to 2.01) and then remained virtually the same. It decreased slightly for bronchitis or asthma over the 4 years. There was no significant correlation between length of stay and readmission rates for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in any of the four categories. Also, no correlation was observed between length of stay and mean number of physician visits for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in the categories AMI and bronchitis or asthma. answer: Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.	no
question: Surgical management of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta: is endoaortic balloon occlusion safe? context: Occlusion of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta by an endoaortic inflatable balloon has been proposed as an alternative to conventional cross-clamping to prevent injury to the vessel and distal embolization of debris. The safety and the effectiveness of endoaortic occlusion have not been documented in this setting. Endoaortic occlusion was employed in 52 of 2,172 consecutive patients. Surgeon's choice was based on preoperative identification of aortic calcifications or intraoperative epiaortic ultrasonographic scanning. Deaths and strokes were analyzed casewise and in aggregate. In 10 patients (19.2%), the endoaortic balloon had to be replaced by the ordinary cross-clamp because of incomplete occlusion (n = 5), hindered exposure (n = 2), or balloon rupture (n = 3). In-hospital death occurred in 13 patients (25%), and stroke on awakening from anesthesia in 2 (3.8%). The death rate of patients treated by endoaortic occlusion was significantly higher compared with all other patients (4.2%, p<0.0001) and with the expected estimate by European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (10.5%, p = 0.05). By multivariable analysis, use of endoaortic occlusion was independently associated with in-hospital death (odds ratio = 5.609, 95% confidence interval: 2.684 to 11.719). Although the stroke rate was higher in the endoaortic occlusion group compared with all other patients, the difference was only possibly significant (3.8% versus 0.8%, p = 0.067). answer: In this series, the endoaortic occlusion was frequently ineffective, and was associated with a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death and a numerically higher risk of stroke.	no
question: Is there a relationship between serum paraoxonase level and epicardial fat tissue thickness? context: This study aimed to show the relationship between serum paraoxonase 1 level and the epicardial fat tissue thickness. Two hundred and seven patients without any atherosclerotic disease history were included in this cross-sectional observational study. Correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness, which was measured by echocardiography and serum paraoxonase 1 level. Also correlation analysis was performed to show correlation between patients' clinical and laboratory findings and the level of serum paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) and the epicardial fat tissue thickness. Pearson and Spearman test were used for correlation analysis. No linear correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness and serum PON 1 found (correlation coefficient: -0.127, p=0.069). When epicardial fat tissue thickness were grouped as 7 mm and over, and below, and 5 mm and over, and below, serum PON 1 level were significantly lower in ≥7 mm group (PON1 : 168.9 U/L) than<7 mm group (PON 1: 253.9 U/L) (p<0.001). Also hypertension prevalence was increased in ≥7 mm group (p=0.001). Serum triglyceride was found to be higher in ≥7 mm group (p=0.014), body mass index was found higher in ≥5 mm group (p=0.006). answer: Serum PON 1 level is not correlated with the epicardial fat tissue thickness. But PON 1 level is lower in patients with epicardial fat tissue thickness 7 mm and over. Therefore, increased atherosclerosis progression can be found among patients with 7 mm and higher epicardial fat tissue thickness.	no
question: Do antibiotics decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity? context: A tonsillectomy audit was carried out and compared with other studies, to emphasize the role of antibiotics. This study was carried out at North West Armed Forces Hospital, Tabuk, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during the year January 1999 through to December 1999. This is a retrospective study of patients who had tonsillectomy with or with adenoidectomy, the topics audited included indication for surgery, grade of surgeon, method of surgery, length of hospital stay, complications and the use of postoperative antibiotics. A total of 185 patients underwent tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. The patients age ranged between 2 years to 53 years and the majority were children. In our audit we found no difference with regard to grade of surgeons, method of hemostasis in the outcome of surgery. Moreover, postoperative antibiotics had no role in pain control, postoperative fever, secondary hemorrhage or reduction in hospital stay. The administration of analgesics on the basis of, as required, had poor pain control. answer: Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.	no
question: Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index? context: Obesity may be associated with lower prostate specific antigen through hemodilution. We examined the relationship between body mass index and prostate specific antigen by age in men without prostate cancer in a longitudinal aging study to determine whether prostate specific antigen must be adjusted for body mass index. The study population included 994 men (4,937 observations) without prostate cancer in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Mixed effects models were used to examine the relationship between prostate specific antigen and body mass index in kg/m(2) by age. Separate models were explored in men with prostate cancer censored at diagnosis, for percent body fat measurements, for weight changes with time and adjusting for initial prostate size in 483 men (2,523 observations) with pelvic magnetic resonance imaging measurements. In men without prostate cancer body mass index was not significantly associated with prostate specific antigen after adjusting for age (p = 0.06). A 10-point body mass index increase was associated with a prostate specific antigen difference of -0.03 ng/ml (95% CI -0.40-0.49). Results were similar when men with prostate cancer were included, when percent body fat was substituted for body mass index, and after adjusting for prostate volume. Longitudinal weight changes also had no significant association with prostate specific antigen. answer: Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.	no
question: Is it necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis? context: Little is known about whether a routinely inserted endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube improves the clinical course in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis after clearance of choledocholithiasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the need for ENBD on the clinical outcomes of patients with acute cholangitis undergoing endoscopic clearance of common bile duct (CBD) stones. Prospective, randomized study. Tertiary referral center. A total of 104 patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis who underwent primary endoscopic treatment were compared according to insertion of an ENBD tube (51 in the ENBD group and 53 in the no-ENBD group). Insertion of an ENBD tube after clearance of CBD stones. Recurrence of cholangitis and length of hospital stay after clearance of CBD stones. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar between both groups. There were no significant differences in the recurrence rate of cholangitis at 24 weeks (3.9% for the ENBD group vs 3.8% for the no-ENBD group at 24 weeks; P = .99) and length of hospital stay (7.9 days [standard error = 1.2] for the ENBD group vs 7.9 days [standard error = 0.7]for the no-ENBD group; P = .98). However, procedure time was longer (26.2 [SE = 1.8] minutes vs 22.7 [SE = 1.0]minutes, respectively; P = .01) and the discomfort score was higher (4.9 [SE = 0.4] vs 2.8 [SE = 0.3], respectively; P = .02) in the ENBD group than in the no-ENBD group. Single-center study. answer: A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.	no
question: Have antiepileptic drug prescription claims changed following the FDA suicidality warning? context: In January 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) communicated concerns and, in May 2009, issued a warning about an increased risk of suicidality for all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This research evaluated the association between the FDA suicidality communications and the AED prescription claims among members with epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder. A longitudinal interrupted time-series design was utilized to evaluate Oklahoma Medicaid claims data from January 2006 through December 2009. The study included 9289 continuously eligible members with prevalent diagnoses of epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder and at least one AED prescription claim. Trends, expressed as monthly changes in the log odds of AED prescription claims, were compared across three time periods: before (January 2006 to January 2008), during (February 2008 to May 2009), and after (June 2009 to December 2009) the FDA warning. Before the FDA warning period, a significant upward trend of AED prescription claims of 0.01% per month (99% CI: 0.008% to 0.013%, p<0.0001) was estimated. In comparison to the prewarning period, no significant change in trend was detected during (-20.0%, 99% CI: -70.0% to 30.0%, p=0.34) or after (80.0%, 99% CI: -20.0% to 200.0%, p=0.03) the FDA warning period. After stratification, no diagnostic group (i.e., epilepsy alone, epilepsy and comorbid psychiatric disorder, and psychiatric disorder alone) experienced a significant change in trend during the entire study period (p>0.01). answer: During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.	no
question: Are high flow nasal cannulae noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants? context: Noise exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit is believed to be a risk factor for hearing loss in preterm neonates. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices exceed recommended noise levels. High flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are an increasingly popular alternative to CPAP for treating preterm infants, but there are no in vivo studies assessing noise production by HFNC. To study whether HFNC are noisier than bubble CPAP (BCPAP) for preterm infants. An observational study of preterm infants receiving HFNC or BCPAP. Noise levels within the external auditory meatus (EAM) were measured using a microphone probe tube connected to a calibrated digital dosimeter. Noise was measured across a range of frequencies and reported as decibels A-weighted (dBA). A total of 21 HFNC and 13 BCPAP noise measurements were performed in 21 infants. HFNC gas flows were 2-5 L/min, and BCPAP gas flows were 6-10 L/min with set pressures of 5-7 cm of water. There was no evidence of a difference in average noise levels measured at the EAM: mean difference (95% CI) of -1.6 (-4.0 to 0.9) dBA for HFNC compared to BCPAP. At low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was mean (95% CI) 3.0 (0.3 to 5.7) dBA quieter than BCPAP. Noise increased with increasing BCPAP gas flow (p=0.007), but not with increasing set pressure. There was a trend to noise increasing with increasing HFNC gas flows. answer: At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.	no
question: Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype? context: To examine family-based transmission of the number of 5' flanking arginine vasopressin V1a receptor (AVPR1A) microsatellites, which include [(GATA)(14)] and complex [(CT)(4)-TT-(CT)(8)-(GT)(24)]repeats, in probands with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype (PEA-BP). Preferential transmission of the number of AVPR1A microsatellite repeats to hypersexual and uninhibited people-seeking probands was hypothesized, based on reports from preclinical work in the literature. Probands were 83 participants in an ongoing controlled study of PEA-BP. The PEA-BP phenotype was defined by DSM-IV mania with at least one of the cardinal symptoms of mania (elation and/or grandiosity) to avoid diagnosing mania only by symptoms that overlapped with those for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Comprehensive assessment of the probands included separate Washington University in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (WASH-U-KSADS) interviews of parents about their children and of children about themselves. Hypersexuality and uninhibited people-seeking were assessed from the corresponding WASH-U-KSADS items. Microsatellite genotyping of the AVPR1A repeats was conducted using fluorescently labeled primers and detected by laser-induced fluorescence. Alleles were determined with the assistance of semi-automated allele-calling software. There were 32 complete, biological trios (28 informative families) for the GATA repeat and 34 complete, biological trios (30 informative families) for the complex repeat. Data were analyzed using case-control and family-based association methods. Preferential transmission of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats was not significant for hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking, using the transmission disequilibrium test. Similarly, case-control analyses found no significant associations between hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking and the number of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats. For p<0.05, there was about 80% power to detect odds ratios of 5.0 and 4.0 (in the family-based analyses) and 3.5 and 2.6 (in the case-control analyses), for allele frequencies of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively. answer: Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.	no
question: Are variations in the use of carotid endarterectomy explained by population Need? context: to describe variation in utilisation of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) within two English health regions and explore relationships between use, need and proximity to services. consecutive case series of operations. Comparison at a population level with district stroke mortality, hospital admissions and material deprivation. standardised utilisation rates for CEA and measures of inter-district variability. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for associations between variables. variation in utilisation rates was considerable (14-fold difference across district populations). More individuals had bilateral surgery in the Yorkshire region than in the Northern (11.7% vs. 5.5%, p=0.002). There was no association between utilisation rates for CEA and district stroke mortality (r=-0.06, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.30) or admission rates for stroke (r=0.17, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.49). There was a strong relationship between residence in districts where services were located and higher utilisation. Rates of CEA were lowest in the regions' most affluent wards. answer: use of CEA varies widely, depending on area of residence. Variation is not a consequence of differences in need, but reflects clinical practice and supply of services. There is evidence to suggest unmet need for CEA.	no
question: Do supervised colorectal trainees differ from consultants in terms of quality of TME surgery? context: The quality of surgical excision is held to be a major determinant of outcome following surgery for rectal cancer. Macroscopic examination of the excised mesorectum allows for reproducible assessment of the quality of surgery. We aimed to determine whether quality of excision undertaken by colorectal trainees under supervision was comparable with that performed by consultants, as measured using mesorectal grades. A total of 130 consecutive patients undergoing potentially curative resection for primary adenocarcinoma of the rectum in our centre from 2001 to 2003 were included in the study. The pathologists graded the excised mesorectum according to staged classification proposed by Quirke. The outcome (quality of mesorectal excision and secondary outcomes including local recurrence and overall recurrence) of operations performed by consultants was compared with that of trainees. Statistical significance was tested using Pearson chi(2) test. Eighty-nine operations were performed by consultants and 41 by senior colorectal trainees with consultant supervision. Forty-four patients (49%) had good mesorectum when operated by consultants in comparison with 17 (41.5%) by the trainees. There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.717) between the two groups in terms of quality of mesorectum excised after potentially curative resection. Furthermore, there were seven local recurrences in patients operated by consultants (7.8%) when compared with four in the trainee group (9.5%) and once again there was no statistical significance between the two groups (P = 0.719). answer: We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.	no
question: Major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence: Does comorbidity lead to poorer outcomes of depression? context: Comorbid major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), particularly in adolescents, have been shown to be associated with poorer subsequent MD outcomes. Longitudinal data were used to model associations between a four-level classification of MD/AUD during the period 15-18 years (neither; MD-only; AUD-only; comorbid MD/AUD) and MD over the period 18-35 years. These associations were then adjusted for confounding by a series of factors measured in childhood. The three disorder groups had rates of adult MD during the period 18-35 years that were significantly (p<.05) higher than that of the group with no disorder. Furthermore, those in the comorbid MD/AUD group had significantly (p<.05) higher rates of adult MD than those in the AUD-only group, and marginally (p<.10) higher rates of adult MD than those in the MD-only group. After adjustment for confounding, the difference in rates of adult MD between the MD-only group and the MD/AUD group were no longer statistically significant. The factors that explained the associations were gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse. The data were obtained by self-report, and may have been subject to biases. answer: The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.	no
question: Perioperative care in an animal model for training in abdominal surgery: is it necessary a preoperative fasting? context: Demonstrate that the rabbit may be used in the training of surgery, in addition to present its perioperative care. Thirty two animals, with age and weight, respectively, from 3 to 5.5 months old and 3000 to 4200 grams, were undergone different periods of pre-operative fasting, exclusive intramuscular anesthesia (ketamine+xylazine), laparotomy with total gastrectomy and total splenectomy. It was dosed the pre-operative (initial) and post-surgical (end) serum blood glucose, in addition to quantify the gastric content after the resection of the part. The anesthetical-surgical procedure presented a mortality rate of 3.125% (1:32) and a morbidity rate of 6.25% (2:32). It was evidenced an initial mean blood glucose = 199.4 mg/dl and the end = 326.1 mg/dl. In spite of extended fasting (minimum of 2 hours for the absolute fasting and maximum of 8.5 hours for liquids, and 20.5 hours for solids) all animals presented at the end of the surgical procedure any gastric content and a blood glucose increase. Those with fasting for liquids and solids when compared to the quantity of solid gastric content, presented a moderate negative degree of correlation. answer: The rabbit is a good model to be used in training of surgery, with a low morbi-mortality, able to be anesthetized intramuscularly, with no need of pre-operative fasting and does not present hypoglycemia even with the extended fasting period.	no
question: Metastatic carcinoma to the cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site: Is there a need for neck dissection? context: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes and patterns of failure in patients with metastatic carcinoma to cervical lymph nodes from an unknown head and neck primary origin, who were treated curatively with radiotherapy, with or without neck dissection. The study included 61 patients referred to the McGill University Hospital Centers from 1987 to 2002. The median age was 57 years, with male to female ratio of 4:1. Distribution of patients by N status was as follows: N1, 16 patients (26%); N2a, 18 (30%); N2b, 13 (22%); N2c, 7 (11%); and N3, 7 (11%). Twenty patients underwent neck dissection (11 radical, 9 functional) and 41 patients had biopsy (9 fine-needle aspiration and 32 excisional biopsy). All patients received radiotherapy. The median dose to the involved node(s) was 64 Gy, and 60 Gy to the rest of the neck. Treatment of the neck was bilateral in 50 patients (82%) and ipsilateral in 11 (18%). The minimum duration of the follow-up was 12 months, with the median of 32 months. The 5- and 8-year overall survival for the whole population was 79% and 67%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the 8-year actuarial overall survival (64.8% and 67.6%, respectively, p = .64) and local relapse-free survival (75% vs 74.5%, respectively, p = .57), among patients who had biopsy versus those who had neck dissection. answer: In our experience, definitive radiotherapy to the neck and the potential mucosal sites, whether preceded by neck dissection or not, is effective to achieve a good local control rate in the unknown primary cancer of the head and neck. The indication for neck dissection, in particular for early nodal stage, is controversial.	no
question: Does Viral Co-Infection Influence the Severity of Acute Respiratory Infection in Children? context: Multiple viruses are often detected in children with respiratory infection but the significance of co-infection in pathogenesis, severity and outcome is unclear. To correlate the presence of viral co-infection with clinical phenotype in children admitted with acute respiratory infections (ARI). We collected detailed clinical information on severity for children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study (GENDRES network) between 2011-2013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK. 204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory support requirement (OR: 7.484; P-value<0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (OR: 1.468; P-value<0.001). In addition, pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor in terms of degree of respiratory distress (OR: 2.917; P-value = 0.035), PICU admission (OR: 0.301; P-value = 0.011), lower clinical score (-1.499; P-value = 0.021) respiratory support requirement (OR: 0.324; P-value = 0.016) and oxygen necessity (OR: 0.328; P-value = 0.001). All these findings were replicated in the UK cohort. answer: The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.	no
question: Cardiopulmonary bypass temperature does not affect postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome? context: To determine if temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has an effect on perioperative and postoperative thyroid function. Prospective study comparing thyroid function during and after hypothermic and normothermic CPB. Cardiac surgical unit at a university-affiliated hospital. Twelve patients scheduled to undergo cardiac operations with normothermic (n = 6) or hypothermic (n = 6) CPB. Blood was analyzed for serum concentration of total thyroxine (TT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), free T3 (fT3), reverse T3 (rT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) preoperatively, 60 min after CPB was initiated, 30 min after discontinuing CPB, and on postoperative days (POD) 1, 3, and 5. Patients who underwent either cold (26 degrees +/- 5 degrees C) or warm (35 degrees +/- 1 degree C) CPB were comparable with regard to age, body weight, duration of CPB, cross-clamp time, use of inotropes, total heparin dose, and length of hospital stay. Incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and death were similar. In both groups, TT4 and TT3 were reduced below baseline values beginning with CPB and persisting for up to 5 days after CPB (p<0.05), free T3 was reduced for up to 3 days after CPB (p<0.05), mean serum rT3 was elevated on POD 1 and POD 3 (p<0.05), and TSH remained unchanged. answer: The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the "euthyroid sick syndrome" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.	no
question: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition? context: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is an uncommon variant of chronic cholecystitis, characterized by marked thickening of the gallbladder wall and dense local adhesions. It often mimics a gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), and may coexist with GBC, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. Furthermore, the premalignant nature of this entity is not known. This study was undertaken to assess the p53, PCNA and beta-catenin expression in XGC in comparison to GBC and chronic inflammation. Sections from paraffin-embedded blocks of surgically resected specimens of GBC (69 cases), XGC (65), chronic cholecystitis (18) and control gallbladder (10) were stained with the monoclonal antibodies to p53 and PCNA, and a polyclonal antibody to beta-catenin. p53 expression was scored as the percentage of nuclei stained. PCNA expression was scored as the product of the percentage of nuclei stained and the intensity of the staining (1-3). A cut-off value of 80 for this score was taken as a positive result. Beta-catenin expression was scored as type of expression-membranous, cytoplasmic or nuclear staining. p53 mutation was positive in 52% of GBC cases and 3% of XGC, but was not expressed in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. p53 expression was lower in XGC than in GBC (P<0.0001). PCNA expression was seen in 65% of GBC cases and 11% of XGC, but not in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. PCNA expression was higher in GBC than XGC (P=0.0001), but there was no significant difference between the XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. Beta-catenin expression was positive in the GBC, XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. But the expression pattern in XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders was homogenously membranous, whereas in GBC the membranous expression pattern was altered to cytoplasmic and nuclear. answer: The expression of p53, PCNA and beta-catenin in XGC was significantly different from GBC and similar to chronic cholecystitis, thus indicating the inflammatory nature of XGC and may not support a premalignant nature of the lesion.	no
question: Does septoplasty change the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate? context: To measure the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate in patients with nasal septal deviation, before and after septoplasty. The mucosal and bony structures of the middle turbinate and the angle of the septum were measured using radiological analysis before septoplasty and at least one year after septoplasty. All pre- and post-operative measurements of the middle turbinate were compared using the paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. The dimensions of bony and mucosal components of the middle turbinate on concave and convex sides of the septum were not significantly changed by septoplasty. There was a significant negative correlation after septoplasty between the angle of the septum and the middle turbinate total area on the deviated side (p = 0.033). answer: The present study findings suggest that compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate is not affected by septoplasty, even after one year.	no
question: Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice? context: Stock et al. (Eur Respir J 25:47-53, 2005) recently estimated asthma prevalence in Germany using claims data on prescriptions and hospital diagnoses and found high prevalence peaks in infants. Our objective was to critically assess and discuss various aspects of identifying children with asthma using prescription data. We replicated the selection procedure of Stock et al. using data on 290,919 children aged 0-17 years insured in the Gmünder ErsatzKasse (GEK) in 2005. Asthma prevalence was also estimated in a sample of 17,641 children aged 0-17 years participating in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) from 2003 to 2006. In children aged 0-4 years insured in the GEK, prevalences were found to range from 11.7 to 17.7% for boys and from 7.2 to 11.1% for girls when the criteria of Stock et al. were applied. A steady decline in prevalences was observed in older age groups. Asthma prevalence estimated in the KiGGS data showed a quite different distribution. In the age group 0-4 years, prevalences were found to range from 0 to 2.6% in boys and from 0 to 1.0% in girls; in children>4 years, prevalences were found to increase with increasing age. answer: When additional validation studies were taken into account, asthma medications were found to be prescribed not only for asthma but also for other respiratory diseases. In addition, not all children with current asthma had prescriptions. We therefore conclude that asthma medications are therefore not a good proxy for the disease.	no
question: Does combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients? context: Combining various antiretroviral agents into one single dosage form has been a strategy to reduce pill burden and enhance medication adherence among human immunodeficiency virus /AIDS (HIV/AIDS) patients. This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with ≥2 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with ≥2 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. answer: Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.	no
question: Does desflurane alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery? context: Although desflurane is commonly used to control surgically induced hypertension, its effects on left ventricular (LV) function have not been investigated in this clinical situation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the LV function response to desflurane, when used to control intraoperative hypertension. In 50 patients, scheduled for vascular surgery, anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.5 microg/kg, midazolam 0.3 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with increments of drugs with controlled ventilation (N2O/O2=60/40%) until the start of surgery. A 5 Mhz transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted after intubation. Pulmonary artery catheter and TEE measurements were obtained after induction (to)(control value), at surgical incision (t1) if it was associated with an increase in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) greater than 140 mmHg (hypertension) and after control of hemodynamic parameters by administration of desflurane (return of systolic arterial pressure to within 20% of the control value) (t2) in a fresh gas flow of 31/ min. Sixteen patients developed hypertension at surgical incision. SAP was controlled by desflurane in all 16 patients. Afterload assessed by systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), end-systolic wall-stress (ESWS) and left-ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) increased with incision until the hypertension returned to post-induction values with mean end-tidal concentration of 5.1+/-0.7% desflurane. No change in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change and left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening was noted when desflurane was added to restore blood pressure. answer: This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.	no
question: Is fluoroscopy essential for retrieval of lower ureteric stones? context: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of ureteroscopy for lower ureteric stones without the use of fluoroscopy. Between June 2001 and January 2005, a total of 110 patients with a mean age of 33.5 years (range 12-65) suffering from of lower ureteral calculi (below the upper margin of the sacroiliac joint) prospectively underwent ureteroscopic removal. Retrograde pyelography was avoided, and no safety guidewire was placed. Whenever required, the ureteric meatus was dilated with a ureteric balloon under direct vision. Double-J stent placement was done with the aid of ureteroscopy. A fluoroscope was kept standby. The patients had a postoperative X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region to document the stone clearance. The mean stone size was 8.7 mm (range 6-15). Complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 99 patients (94.2%). Fluoroscopy was required in 6 patients (4%) for calcified stricture (n = 1), duplex system (n = 1), narrow and tortuous meatus causing difficulty in passing the 5-Fr balloon dilator (n = 3), and confirmation of spontaneous passage of the stone (n = 1). Of the 13 patients who required balloon dilatation it was successfully achieved without fluoroscopy. Double-J stenting was done due to mucosal ulceration (n = 3), polypoid reaction (n = 2), and perforation (n = 1). All these patients had correct placement of the stent, as confirmed by X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region postoperatively. answer: To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.	no
question: Does the treatment of amblyopia normalise subfoveal choroidal thickness in amblyopic children? context: Recent studies have found a choroidal thickening in amblyopic eyes and suggested that there might be a relationship between the choroid and amblyopia. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a six-month treatment of amblyopia on choroidal thickness in anisometropic hyperopic amblyopic children. Thirty-two anisometropic hyperopic children with unilateral amblyopia were included in this prospective study. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was measured as the distance between the retinal pigment epithelium and the chorioscleral edge, by using spectral domain enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography. The treatment of amblyopia was performed based on the full correction of the refractive error with eyeglasses, a refractive adaptation phase and occlusion by patching the fellow eye. The mean visual acuity of the amblyopic eyes significantly increased from 0.35 ± 0.3 to 0.16 ± 0.2 logMAR after the treatment (p < 0.001). The mean initial choroidal thickness was significantly higher in the amblyopic eyes than in the fellow eyes (p = 0.019). There were no significant differences between the pre- and post-treatment mean choroidal thickness in the amblyopic eyes (p = 0.428) and in the fellow eyes (p = 0.343). The mean choroidal thickness was still higher in the amblyopic eyes than in the fellow eyes after the treatment (p = 0.006). answer: Although a six-month treatment of amblyopia increased the visual acuity of the anisometropic hyperopic amblyopic eyes, it could not significantly change choroidal thickness. Our results were in accordance with the conventional explanation, which suggests visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus abnormalities in the pathophysiology of amblyopia.	no
question: Should tumor depth be included in prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma? context: Most staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma are based on histologic malignancy-grade, tumor size and tumor depth. These factors are generally dichotomized, size at 5 cm. We believe it is unlikely that tumor depth per se should influence a tumor's metastatic capability. Therefore we hypothesized that the unfavourable prognostic importance of depth could be explained by the close association between size and depth, deep-seated tumors on average being larger than the superficial ones. When tumor size is dichotomized, this effect should be most pronounced in the large size (>5 cm) group in which the size span is larger. We analyzed the associations between tumor size and depth and the prognostic importance of grade, size and depth in a population-based series of 490 adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk wall with complete, 4.5 years minimum, follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed no major prognostic effect of tumor depth when grade and size were taken into account. The mean size of small tumors was the same whether superficial or deep but the mean size of large and deep-seated tumors were one third larger than that of large but superficial tumors. Tumor depth influenced the prognosis in the subset of high-grade and large tumors. In this subset deep-seated tumors had poorer survival rate than superficial tumors, which could be explained by the larger mean size of the deep-seated tumors. answer: Most of the prognostic value of tumor depth in soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity or trunk wall can be explained by the association between tumor size and depth.	no
question: Does performance in selection processes predict performance as a dental student? context: This study investigated associations between the performance of dental students in each of the three components of the selection procedure [academic average, Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT) and structured interview], socio-demographic characteristics and their academic success in an undergraduate dental surgery programme. Longitudinal review of admissions data relating to students entering dental education at the University of Otago, New Zealand, between 2004 and 2009 was compared with academic performance throughout the dental programme. After controlling for variables, pre-admission academic average, UMAT scores and interview performance did not predict performance as a dental student. Class place in second year, however, was a strong predictor of class place in final year. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the best predictors of higher class placement in the final year were New Zealand European ethnicity and domestic (rather than international) student status. Other socio-demographic characteristics were not associated with performance. These interim findings provide a sound base for the ongoing study. answer: The study found important socio-demographic differences in pre-admission test scores, but those scores did not predict performance in the dental programme, whether measured in second year or in final year.	no
question: Antiretroviral therapy related adverse effects: Can sub-Saharan Africa cope with the new "test and treat" policy of the World Health Organization? context: Recent studies have shown that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation results in significant HIV transmission reduction. This is the rationale behind the "test and treat" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO). Implementation of this policy will lead to an increased incidence of ART-related adverse effects, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Is the region yet ready to cope with such a challenging issue? The introduction and widespread use of ART have drastically changed the natural history of HIV/AIDS, but exposure to ART leads to serious medication-related adverse effects mainly explained by mitochondrial toxicities, and the situation will get worse in the near future. Indeed, ART is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes and overt diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis. The prevalence of these disorders is already high in SSA, and the situation will be exacerbated by the implementation of the new WHO recommendations. Most SSA countries are characterized by (extreme) poverty, very weak health systems, inadequate and low quality of health services, inaccessibility to existing health facilities, lack of (qualified) health personnel, lack of adequate equipment, inaccessibility and unaffordability of medicines, and heavy workload in a context of a double burden of disease. Additionally, there is dearth of data on the incidence and predictive factors of ART-related adverse effects in SSA, to anticipate on strategies that should be put in place to prevent the occurrence of these conditions or properly estimate the upcoming burden and prepare an adequate response plan. These are required if we are to anticipate and effectively prevent this upcoming burden. answer: While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the "test and treat" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the "test and treat" policy.	no
question: Expression of c-kit protooncogen in hepatitis B virus-induced chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma: has it a diagnostic role? context: Paraffin-embedded tissues in Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine Department of Pathology between January 2002 and February 2006 were searched restrospectively to investigate this issue. We performed immunohistochemistry on biopsies of 125 patients with HBV infection, grouped as: mild, moderate and severe hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC, 25 patients in each of them, using anti c-kit monoclonal antibody. The severity of parenchymal inflammation and of interface hepatitis was semiquantitatively graded on a haematoxylin and eosin stained paraffin sections. Additionally, 50 more HCC, formed on HBV basis, were studied to determine the prevalence of c-kit overexpression. In cirrhotic liver, lower intensity of staining and rarely c-kit positivity were present. The greatest number of the c-kit positivity and higher intensity of staining was found in the livers of patients with severe hepatitis and HCC. In chronic hepatitis B infection, the staining intensity was parallel with the grade and stage of the disease. In the areas where fibrosis was seen, c-kit positivity was rare or absent. In the HCC specimens, c-kit positivity appeared both inside and around the cancerous nodes. C-kit expression was observed in 62 of 75 HCC tissue specimens (82%) (p<0.001). answer: C-kit positivity was observed in the mitotic, proliferating and also dysplastic hepatic cells. These results suggest that c-kit expression may be used as an early diagnostic indicator for HBV induced HCC.	maybe
question: Can calprotectin predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease? context: Assessing the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients consists of periodical clinical evaluations and laboratory tests. We aimed to assess the role of calprotectin tests in predicting clinical relapse in IBD patients. Ninety-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission were prospectively included in the study. A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were tested using the log-rank test. The calprotectin test was positive in 44 UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02). answer: Measuring calprotectin may help to identify UC and colonic CD patients at higher risk of clinical relapse.	maybe
question: Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery? context: A prospective randomized clinical study. To determine whether shaving the incision site before spinal surgery causes postsurgical infection. Spine surgeons usually shave the skin of the incision site immediately before surgery is performed. However, evidence from some surgical series suggests that presurgical shaving may increase the postsurgical infection rate. To our knowledge, no previously published studies have addressed this issue. A total of 789 patients scheduled to undergo spinal surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups: those in whom the site of operation was shaved immediately before surgery (shaved group; 371 patients) and the patients in whom presurgical shaving was not performed (unshaved group; 418 patients). The mean duration of anesthesia and the infection rates in both groups were recorded and compared. The duration of anesthesia did not differ in the 2 groups (P>0.05). A postoperative infection developed in 4 patients in the shaved group and in 1 patient in the nonshaved group (P<0.01). answer: The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.	maybe
question: Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH? context: The purpose of this study is to determine if baseline antral follicle assessment may serve as additional information in predicting in vitro fertilization outcome. Prospective, descriptive preliminary study of in vitro fertilization outcome. From July 1998 to July 1999, 224 patients underwent antral follicle assessment (follicle 2-6 mm in diameter) on baseline of the planned, stimulated in vitro fertilization cycle. The outcomes were analyzed with respect to antral follicle assessment (<or = 6 or>6), basal cycle day 3 follicle stimulated hormone (<or = 10 or>10 IU/L) and maternal age (<or = 35 or>35 years). The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle>6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle<or = 6 (51% vs. 19%, respectively). Controlling for patient age, and basal follicle stimulated hormone, the pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle>6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle<or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly increased with advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and baseline antral follicle<or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle<or = 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle>or = 6 (33% vs. 1%, respectively). answer: In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.	maybe
question: Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more? context: Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective. We reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia. Thirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up. answer: We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.	maybe
question: Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening? context: As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening. Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback. Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic. 1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest. Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses. answer: While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.	maybe
question: Do Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms? context: Although the Internet is commonly used to recruit samples in studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related risk behaviors, it has not been used to measure patient-reported well-being. As the burden of long-term chronic HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to research and interventions. This study aimed to compare two samples of gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden. The Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this analysis. The Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated with high physical symptom score. The only variable that remained significantly associated with high physical symptom score was employment status, with those in employment being less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile versus the other two tertiles (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.62, P<.001). For the psychological symptom burden model, those recruited via the Web were significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) tertile (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.44, P=.001). In addition, those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological symptom tertile compared to those not in employment (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.49, P<.001). answer: Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.	maybe
question: Are home sampling kits for sexually transmitted infections acceptable among men who have sex with men? context: There is an urgent need to increase opportunistic screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in community settings, particularly for those who are at increased risk including men who have sex with men (MSM). The aim of this qualitative study was to explore whether home sampling kits (HSK) for multiple bacterial STIs are potentially acceptable among MSM and to identify any concerns regarding their use. This study was developed as part of a formative evaluation of HSKs. Focus groups and one-to-one semi-structured interviews with MSM were conducted. Focus group participants (n = 20) were shown a variety of self-sampling materials and asked to discuss them. Individual interviewees (n = 24) had experience of the self-sampling techniques as part of a pilot clinical study. All data were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a framework analysis approach. The concept of a HSK was generally viewed as positive, with many benefits identified relating to increased access to testing, enhanced personal comfort and empowerment. Concerns about the accuracy of the test, delays in receiving the results, the possible lack of support and potential negative impact on 'others' were raised. answer: The widespread acceptability of using HSKs for the diagnosis of STIs could have important public health impacts in terms of earlier diagnosis of asymptomatic infections and thus a decrease in the rate of onward transmission. In addition, HSKs could potentially optimize the use of genitourinary medicine services and facilitate patient choice.	maybe
question: Does rugby headgear prevent concussion? context: To examine the attitudes of players and coaches to the use of protective headgear, particularly with respect to the prevention of concussion. A questionnaire designed to assess attitudes to headgear was administered to 63 players from four different Canadian teams, each representing a different level of play (high school, university, community club, national). In addition, coaches from all four levels were questioned about team policies and their personal opinions about the use of headgear to prevent concussion. Although the players tended to believe that the headgear could prevent concussion (62%), the coaches were less convinced (33%). Despite the players' belief that headgear offers protection against concussion, only a minority reported wearing headgear (27%) and few (24%) felt that its use should be made mandatory. Common reasons for not wearing headgear were "its use is not mandatory", "it is uncomfortable", and "it costs too much". answer: Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.	maybe
question: Does body mass index (BMI) influence morbidity and long-term survival in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy? context: The long-term survival of patients with gastric cancer is governed by various factors, such as the clinical stage of the cancer, the patient's nutritional state, and the treatment and may be governed by the volume of intraperitoneal adipose tissue. The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between the degree of the patients' body mass index and their long-term survival. Gastric cancer patients who had undergone a gastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy and with resection A and B according to the criteria of the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer Rules were subgrouped into those patients with a body mass index<0.185 (the lower body mass index group) and those patients with a body mass index>0.210 (the higher body mass index group). The patient's morbidity and long-term survival rate was retrospectively compared between the 2 groups. A significantly longer mean survival rate was observed for the lower body mass index group in stage 2 (1667 vs. 1322 days, P = 0.0240). Also, a significantly longer mean survival rate was observed for the higher BMI group in stage 3a (1431 vs. 943, P = 0.0071). answer: The body mass index is one of the prognostic factors of stage 2 and stage 3a gastric cancer. However, it does not appear to be useful for determining the prognosis of stage 1a, 1b, 3b, and 4a gastric cancers.	maybe
question: Is determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury clinically relevant? context: Prospective multicenter longitudinal cohort study. To validate the prognostic value of the acute phase sacral sparing measurements with regard to chronic phase-independent ambulation in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). European Multicenter Study of Human Spinal Cord Injury (EM-SCI). In 432 patients, acute phase (0-15 days) American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)/International Spinal Cord Society neurological standard scale (AIS) grades, ASIA sacral sparing measurements, which are S4-5 light touch (LT), S4-5 pin prick (PP), anal sensation and voluntary anal contraction; and chronic phase (6 or 12 months) indoor mobility Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) measurements were analyzed. Calculations of positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed in all four sacral sparing criteria. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) ratios of all regression equations was calculated. To achieve independent ambulation 1-year post injury, a normal S4-5 PP score showed the best PPV (96.5%, P<0.001, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 87.9-99.6). Best NPV was reported in the S4-5 LT score (91.7%, P<0.001, 95% CI: 81.6-97.2). The use of the combination of only voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP sensory scores (AUC: 0.906, P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.871-0.941) showed significantly better (P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.038-0.128) discriminating results in prognosticating 1-year independent ambulation than with the use of currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI (AUC: 0.823, P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.781-0.864). answer: Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.	maybe
question: Does use of hydrophilic guidewires significantly improve technical success rates of peripheral PTA? context: To determine whether the use of hydrophilic guidewires has increased the technical success rate of peripheral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).MATERIAL/ We performed 125 procedures and analyzed the technical success rates of PTA using the conventional guidewire first and then if needed, the hydrophilic guidewire for iliac and SFA stenoses or occlusions. Angioplasty was performed on 25 stenosed, 25 occluded iliac arteries and 25 stenosed, 50 occluded femoral arteries. The result was defined as technical success when the lesion was crossed by a guidewire and balloon, then it was dilated with restoration of vessel lumen and less than 30% residual stenosis and the rise in ABI values was at least 0.15 after 24 hours. The technical success rate after PTA of stenosed iliac arteries was achieved in 96% (24/25) using conventional wires and 100% using hydrophilic guidewire; in iliac occlusions, the rates were 60% (15/25) and 96%, respectively; in femoral stenosis - 84% (21/25) and 100%; in occlusions in the first group: lesions<10 cm -64% (16/25) and 96%, in the second group: lesions>10 cm -48% (12/25) and 88%. In the iliac group, there was no significant difference in the success of iliac stenosis PTA. However, there were significant changes in the success rates of PTA performed for SFA stenosis and iliac and SFA occlusions. answer: In summary, we report an overall improvement and high technical success rate for peripherial PTA. The use of hydrophilic guidewires made significant difference to the technical success rate of PTA, especially in occlusion and more complicated lesions.	maybe
question: Are lifetime prevalence of impetigo, molluscum and herpes infection really increased in children having atopic dermatitis? context: Cutaneous infections such as impetigo contagiosum (IC), molluscum contagiosum (MC) and herpes virus infection (HI) appear to be associated with atopic dermatitis (AD), but there are no reports of concrete epidemiological evidence. We evaluated the association of childhood AD with these infections by conducting a population-based cross-sectional study. Enrolled in this study were 1117 children aged 0-6 years old attending nursery schools in Ishigaki City, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Physical examination was performed by dermatologists, and a questionnaire was completed on each child's history of allergic diseases including AD, asthma, allergic rhinitis and egg allergy, and that of skin infections including IC, MC and HI, as well as familial history of AD. In 913 children (AD; 132), a history of IC, MC or HI was observed in 45.1%, 19.7%, and 2.5%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of having a history of IC were 1.8 times higher in AD children than in non-AD children. Meanwhile, a history of MC was significantly correlated to the male gender, but not to a personal history of AD. As for HI, we found no correlated factors in this study. answer: The lifetime prevalence of IC was indeed higher in young children with a history of AD.	maybe
question: Can routinely collected ambulance data about assaults contribute to reduction in community violence? context: The 'law of spatiotemporal concentrations of events' introduced major preventative shifts in policing communities. 'Hotspots' are at the forefront of these developments yet somewhat understudied in emergency medicine. Furthermore, little is known about interagency 'data-crossover', despite some developments through the Cardiff Model. Can police-ED interagency data-sharing be used to reduce community-violence using a hotspots methodology? 12-month (2012) descriptive study and analysis of spatiotemporal clusters of police and emergency calls for service using hotspots methodology and assessing the degree of incident overlap. 3775 violent crime incidents and 775 assault incidents analysed using spatiotemporal clustering with k-means++ algorithm and Spearman's rho. Spatiotemporal location of calls for services to the police and the ambulance service are equally highly concentrated in a small number of geographical areas, primarily within intra-agency hotspots (33% and 53%, respectively) but across agencies' hotspots as well (25% and 15%, respectively). Datasets are statistically correlated with one another at the 0.57 and 0.34 levels, with 50% overlap when adjusted for the number of hotspots. At least one in every two police hotspots does not have an ambulance hotspot overlapping with it, suggesting half of assault spatiotemporal concentrations are unknown to the police. Data further suggest that more severely injured patients, as estimated by transfer to hospital, tend to be injured in the places with the highest number of police-recorded crimes. answer: A hotspots approach to sharing data circumvents the problem of disclosing person-identifiable data between different agencies. Practically, at least half of ambulance hotspots are unknown to the police; if causal, it suggests that data sharing leads to both reduced community violence by way of prevention (such as through anticipatory patrols or problem-oriented policing), particularly of more severe assaults, and improved efficiency of resource deployment.	maybe
question: Is irritable bowel syndrome a diagnosis of exclusion? context: Guidelines emphasize that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not a diagnosis of exclusion and encourage clinicians to make a positive diagnosis using the Rome criteria alone. Yet many clinicians are concerned about overlooking alternative diagnoses. We measured beliefs about whether IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and measured testing proclivity between IBS experts and community providers. We developed a survey to measure decision-making in two standardized patients with Rome III-positive IBS, including IBS with diarrhea (D-IBS) and IBS with constipation (C-IBS). The survey elicited provider knowledge and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts. Experts were less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001). Experts only rated celiac sprue screening and complete blood count as appropriate in D-IBS; nonexperts rated most tests as appropriate. Parallel results were found in the C-IBS vignette. answer: Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.	maybe
question: Is a patient's self-reported health-related quality of life a prognostic factor for survival in non-small-cell lung cancer patients? context: The aim of this prognostic factor analysis was to investigate if a patient's self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) provided independent prognostic information for survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Pretreatment HRQOL was measured in 391 advanced NSCLC patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC Lung Cancer module (QLQ-LC13). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for both univariate and multivariate analyses of survival. In addition, a bootstrap validation technique was used to assess the stability of the outcomes. The final multivariate Cox regression model retained four parameters as independent prognostic factors for survival: male gender with a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32 (95% CI 1.03-1.69; P = 0.03); performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) with HR = 1.63 (95% CI 1.04-2.54; P = 0.032); patient's self-reported score of pain with HR= 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.16; P<0.001) and dysphagia with HR = 1.12 (95% CI 1.04-1.21; P = 0.003). A 10-point shift worse in the scale measuring pain and dysphagia translated into an 11% and 12% increased in the likelihood of death respectively. A risk group categorization was also developed. answer: The results suggest that patients' self-reported HRQOL provide independent prognostic information for survival. This finding supports the collection of such data in routine clinical practice.	maybe
question: Vaginal dose assessment in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer: Can we really rely on dose-point evaluation? context: Although dose-volume parameters in image-guided brachytherapy have become a standard, the use of posterior-inferior border of the pubic symphysis (PIBS) points has been recently proposed in the reporting of vaginal doses. The aim was to evaluate their pertinence. Nineteen patients who received image-guided brachytherapy after concurrent radiochemotherapy were included. Per treatment, CT scans were performed at Days 2 and 3, with reporting of the initial dwell positions and times. Doses delivered to the PIBS points were evaluated on each plan, considering that they were representative of one-third of the treatment. The movements of the applicator according to the PIBS point were analysed. Mean prescribed doses at PIBS -2, PIBS, PIBS +2 were, respectively, 2.23 ± 1.4, 6.39 ± 6.6, and 31.85 ± 36.06 Gy. Significant differences were observed between the 5 patients with vaginal involvement and the remaining 14 at the level of PIBS +2 and PIBS: +47.60 Gy and +7.46 Gy, respectively (p = 0.023 and 0.03). The variations between delivered and prescribed doses at PIBS points were not significant. However, at International commission on radiation units and measurements rectovaginal point, the delivered dose was decreased by 1.43 ± 2.49 Gy from the planned dose (p = 0.019). The delivered doses at the four points were strongly correlated with the prescribed doses with R(2) ranging from 0.93 to 0.95. The movements of the applicator in regard of the PIBS point assessed with the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine coordinates were insignificant. answer: The doses evaluated at PIBS points are not impacted by intrafractional movements. PIBS and PIBS +2 dose points allow distinguishing the plans of patients with vaginal infiltration. Further studies are needed to correlate these parameters with vaginal morbidity.	maybe
question: Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis? context: The etiology of hemodialysis (HD)-induced hypotension and hypertension remains speculative. There is mounting evidence that endothelin-1 (ET-1) may play a vital role in these hemodynamic changes. We examined the possible role of intradialytic changes of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of hypotension and rebound hypertension during HD. The present study included 45 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on regular HD. They were divided according to their hemodynamic status during HD into three groups (group I had stable intradialytic hemodynamics, group II had dialysis-induced hypotension, and group III had rebound hypertension during HD). In addition, 15 healthy volunteers were included as a control group. Pulse and blood pressure were monitored before, during (every half hour), and after HD session. ET-1 level was measured at the beginning, middle, and end of HD. ET-1 was measured in the control group for comparison. Pre-dialysis levels of ET-1 were significantly higher in dialysis patients compared to the controls (P<0.001); however, they were comparable in the three HD groups. The post-dialysis ET-1 level was not changed significantly in group I compared with predialysis values (14.49 +/- 2.04 vs. 14.33 +/- 2.23 pg/ml; P = NS), while the ET-1 concentration decreased significantly in group II and increased in group III in comparison to predialysis values (8.56 +/- 1.44 vs. 11.75 +/- 2.51; 16.39 +/- 3.12 vs. 11.93 +/- 2.11 pg/ml, respectively; P<0.001). answer: Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.	maybe
question: Is vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency related to the development of osteochondritis dissecans? context: The aetiology of osteochondritis dissecans is still unclear. The aim of this prospective pilot study was to analyse whether vitamin D insufficiency, or deficiency, might be a contributing etiological factor in the development of an OCD lesion. The serum level of vitamin D3 in 23 consecutive patients (12 male and 11 female) suffering from a stage III, or stages III and IV, OCD lesion (mostly stage III) admitted for surgery was measured. The patients' mean age was 31.3 years and most of them already exhibited closed epiphyseal plates. In the majority of patients (18/23), a distinct vitamin D3 deficiency was found, two patients were vitamin D3-insufficient and, in three patients, the vitamin D3 level reached the lowest normal value. answer: These first data show that a vitamin D3 deficiency rather than an insufficiency may be involved in the development of OCD lesions. Probably, with a vitamin D3 substitution, the development of an advanced OCD stage could be avoided. Further analyses, including morphological analyses regarding a possible osteomalacia, and examination of the PTH and other determinants of the bone metabolism, should be undertaken to either confirm or refute these data.	maybe
question: Does timing of initial surfactant treatment make a difference in rates of chronic lung disease or mortality in premature infants? context: To compare two treatment strategies in preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome: early surfactant administration (within one hour of birth) versus late surfactant administration, in a geographically defined population. The primary outcome was chronic lung disease (CLD) and mortality before/at 36 weeks. Secondary outcomes included: duration of mechanical ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), post-natal steroids for CLD and major neonatal morbidities. Premature infants born at 22-32 weeks' gestation between January 2006 and December 2009. Ten neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in New South Wales (NSW) and Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Australia. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the regional NICU database in NSW and ACT. Of the 2170 infants who received surfactant, 1182 (54.5%) and 988 (45.5%) received early and late surfactant, respectively. The early surfactant group was less mature (27.1 ± 2.1 versus 29.4 ± 2.1 weeks) and had more CLD and mortality (40.2% versus 20.0%). The multivariable analysis showed early surfactant to be associated with less duration of ventilation, longer duration of CPAP and longer hospital stay but had little or no impact on CLD/mortality. answer: Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.	maybe
question: Is it Crohn's disease? context: Sulfasalazine is a widely used anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and several rheumatological disorders. Although as many as 20% of treated patients may experience reversible, dose-dependent side effects, less frequent but potentially severe, systemic reactions have also been reported. A severe systemic reaction to sulfasalazine developed in a 21-year old female with rheumatoid arthritis characterized by eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis and myelotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures. The clinical course and management of this patient are presented as well as a review of the incidence and outcome of severe systemic reactions to sulfasalazine. answer: Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.	maybe
question: Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease? context: To determine under what conditions lay people and health professionals find it acceptable for a physician to breach confidentiality to protect the wife of a patient with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). In a study in France, breaching confidentiality in 48 scenarios were accepted by 144 lay people, 10 psychologists and 7 physicians. The scenarios were all possible combinations of five factors: severity of the disease (severe, lethal); time taken to discuss this with (little time, much time); intent to inform the spouse about the disease (none, one of these days, immediately); intent to adopt protective behaviours (no intent, intent); and decision to consult an expert in STDs (yes, no), 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2. The importance and interactions of each factor were determined, at the group level, by performing analyses of variance and constructing graphs. The concept of breaching confidentiality to protect a wife from her husband's STD was favoured much more by lay people and psychologists than by physicians (mean ratings 11.76, 9.28 and 2.90, respectively, on a scale of 0-22). The patient's stated intentions to protect his wife and to inform her of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability. A cluster analysis showed groups of lay participants who found breaching confidentiality "always acceptable" (n = 14), "depending on the many circumstances" (n = 87), requiring "consultation with an expert" (n = 30) and "never acceptable (n = 13)". answer: Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.	maybe
question: Can patients be anticoagulated after intracerebral hemorrhage? context: Warfarin increases both the likelihood and the mortality of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), particularly in patients with a history of prior ICH. In light of this consideration, should a patient with both a history of ICH and a clear indication for anticoagulation such as nonvalvular atrial fibrillation be anticoagulated? In the absence of data from a clinical trial, we used a decision-analysis model to compare the expected values of 2 treatment strategies-warfarin and no anticoagulation-for such patients. We used a Markov state transition decision model stratified by location of hemorrhage (lobar or deep hemispheric). Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Data sources included English language literature identified through MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from selected articles, along with empirical data from our own institution. The base case focused on a 69-year-old man with a history of ICH and newly diagnosed nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. For patients with prior lobar ICH, withholding anticoagulation therapy was strongly preferred, improving quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.9 QALYs. For patients with prior deep hemispheric ICH, withholding anticoagulation resulted in a smaller gain of 0.3 QALYs. In sensitivity analyses for patients with deep ICH, anticoagulation could be preferred if the risk of thromboembolic stroke is particularly high. answer: Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.	maybe
question: Do elderly patients call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke? context: Among patients with acute stroke symptoms, delay in hospital admission is the main obstacle for the use of thrombolytic therapy and other interventions associated with decreased mortality and disability. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether an elderly clinical population correctly endorsed the response to call for emergency services when presented with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire. We performed a cross-sectional study among elderly out-patients (≥60 years) in Buenos Aires, Argentina randomly recruited from a government funded health clinic. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 was assessed with the Stroke Action Test and the cut-off point was set at ≥75%. Knowledge of stroke and clinical and socio-demographic indicators were also collected and evaluated as predictors of correct endorsement using logistic regression. Among 367 elderly adults, 14% correctly endorsed intention to call 911. Presented with the most typical signs and symptoms, only 65% reported that they would call an ambulance. Amaurosis Fugax was the symptom for which was called the least (15%). On average, the correct response was chosen only 37% of the time. Compared to lower levels of education, higher levels were associated to correctly endorsed intention to call 911 (secondary School adjusted OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.59-7.86 and Tertiary/University adjusted OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.12-8.21). answer: These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.	maybe
question: Are opioid dependence and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) documented in the medical record? context: Opioid-dependent patients often have co-occurring chronic illnesses requiring medications that interact with methadone. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is typically provided separately from medical care. Hence, coordination of medical care and substance use treatment is important to preserve patient safety. To identify potential safety risks among MMT patients engaged in medical care by evaluating the frequency that opioid dependence and MMT documentation are missing in medical records and characterizing potential medication-methadone interactions. Among patients from a methadone clinic who received primary care from an affiliated, but separate, medical center, we reviewed electronic medical records for documentation of methadone, opioid dependence, and potential drug-methadone interactions. The proportions of medical records without opioid dependence and methadone documentation were estimated and potential medication-methadone interactions were identified. Among the study subjects (n = 84), opioid dependence documentation was missing from the medical record in 30% (95% CI, 20%-41%) and MMT documentation was missing from either the last primary care note or the last hospital discharge summary in 11% (95% CI, 5%-19%). Sixty-nine percent of the study subjects had at least 1 medication that potentially interacted with methadone; 19% had 3 or more potentially interacting medications. answer: Among patients receiving MMT and medical care at different sites, documentation of opioid dependence and MMT in the medical record occurs for the majority, but is missing in a substantial number of patients. Most of these patients are prescribed medications that potentially interact with methadone. This study highlights opportunities for improved coordination between medical care and MMT.	maybe
question: Should chest wall irradiation be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer? context: This study aims to evaluate local failure patterns in node negative breast cancer patients treated with post-mastectomy radiotherapy including internal mammary chain only. Retrospective analysis of 92 internal or central-breast node-negative tumours with mastectomy and external irradiation of the internal mammary chain at the dose of 50 Gy, from 1994 to 1998. Local recurrence rate was 5 % (five cases). Recurrence sites were the operative scare and chest wall. Factors associated with increased risk of local failure were age<or = 40 years and tumour size greater than 20mm, without statistical significance. answer: Post-mastectomy radiotherapy should be discussed for a sub-group of node-negative patients with predictors factors of local failure such as age<or = 40 years and larger tumour size.	maybe
question: Does managed care enable more low income persons to identify a usual source of care? context: By requiring or encouraging enrollees to obtain a usual source of care, managed care programs hope to improve access to care without incurring higher costs. (1) To examine the effects of managed care on the likelihood of low-income persons having a usual source of care and a usual physician, and; (2) To examine the association between usual source of care and access. Cross-sectional survey of households conducted during 1996 and 1997. A nationally representative sample of 14,271 low-income persons. Usual source of care, usual physician, managed care enrollment, managed care penetration. High managed care penetration in the community is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons (54.8% vs. 62.2% in low penetration areas) as well as a lower likelihood of having a usual physician (60% vs. 72.8%). Managed care has only marginal effects on the likelihood of having a usual source of care for privately insured and Medicaid beneficiaries. Having a usual physician substantially reduces unmet medical needs for the insured but less so for the uninsured. answer: Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.	maybe
question: Is the cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis apoptotic? context: Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is characterized by neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by recurrent seizures. We searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years). Unlike that in normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining. We also could not detect typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology by Hoechst-33258 or hematoxylin counterstaining. answer: These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.	maybe
question: Does vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia have the same evolution as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia? context: Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia is a little known disease which could be related to risk factors different from simple HPV infections. To ascertain wheter vaginal lesions have a natural history similar to cervical lesions.MATERIALS & A retrospective study to identify patients with vaginal lesions and synchronous cervical lesions through biopsy. The rate of mild cervical lesions (koilocytosis, warts, CIN I with and without koilocytosis) was compared with the rate of severe cervical lesions (CIN II and III, cervical carcinoma) in patients with mild vaginal lesions (warts and koilocytosis, and low-grade VAIN) and in patients with severe vaginal lesions (high-grade VAIN). Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of "active" cervical lesions was compared with the rate of "non active" cervical lesions in patients with "active" versus "non active" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, with or without koilocytosis). In patients with mild vaginal lesions, mild cervical lesions were significantly more frequent than severe cervical lesions. In patients with "active" vaginal lesions the rate of "active" cervical lesions was significantly higher than "non active" cervical lesions. The differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) were not significant. answer: These data suggest that CIN and VAIN may have some common features in certain cases, i.e., if an HPV infection is proved.	maybe
question: Does government assistance improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals? context: To examine whether government-funded, low-income vision care programs improve use of eye care services by low-income individuals in Canada. Cross-sectional survey. 27,375 white respondents to the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Healthy Aging 2008/2009. Government-funded, low-income vision care programs were reviewed. The amount of assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS. To receive low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years and 5.5% aged ≥65 years received social assistance in 2009. The CCHS found in 2008/2009 that 12.5% of citizens aged 45 to 64 years and 13.2% of those aged ≥65 years had difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food. In 5 provinces, low-income vision care assistance fully covers a general/routine eye examination. In the remainder, the assistance provided is insufficient for a general/routine eye examination. The assistance for eyeglasses is inadequate in 5 provinces, requiring out-of-pocket copayments. Among middle-aged whites who self-reported not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by lenses, utilization of eye care providers was 28.1% among those with financial difficulty versus 41.9% among those without (p<0.05), giving a prevalence ratio 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex and education. answer: Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.	maybe
question: HIF1A as a major vascular endothelial growth factor regulator: do its polymorphisms have an association with age-related macular degeneration? context: To investigate the association between age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the polymorphisms of HIF1A, a major vascular epithelial growth factor regulator under hypoxic conditions. The associations of AMD and polymorphisms of genes CFH, SKIV2L and MYRIP were also studied. Prospective study. Eighty-seven AMD patients and 80 healthy subjects admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology at Pamukkale University Hospital, Denizli, Turkey, were included: 45 (52%) had wet type AMD, and 42 (48%) had dry type AMD. Polymorphisms rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) were investigated in DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples of the cases and controls by dye-termination DNA sequencing. Genotype distribution of rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) in AMD cases and healthy controls; association between genotypes and AMD subtypes. Given the significant difference between the mean age of case and control groups (72.13 ± 5.77 vs. 62.80 ± 5.22, respectively) (P = .000), subsequent analyses were adjusted for age. We found that having at least one C allele for polymorphism rs1061170 increases AMD risk independent of age (OR = 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-4.81). The ancestral T allele for polymorphism rs1061170 has a protective effect for AMD (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.34-0.83). No statistically significant difference for distributions of other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) emerged between patients and healthy subjects. answer: No associations appeared between HIF1A SNPs and AMD, which were studied here for the first time; however, polymorphism rs1061170 of the CFH gene is associated with AMD in our population.	maybe
question: Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory? context: The technique of induced sputum has allowed to subdivide asthma patients into inflammatory phenotypes according to their level of granulocyte airway infiltration. There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes. The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p < 0.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Neutrophilic asthma had raised CRP and fibrinogen while eosinophilic asthma only showed raised fibrinogen compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). answer: This study demonstrates that a significant eosinophilic inflammation is present across all categories of asthma, and that paucigranulocytic asthma may be seen as a low grade inflammatory disease.	maybe
question: Do Surrogates of Injury Severity Influence the Occurrence of Heterotopic Ossification in Fractures of the Acetabulum? context: To determine the relationship between injury severity surrogates and other patient factors with the development and severity of heterotopic ossification (HO) following open reduction internal fixation of acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach. Retrospective review. Academic level 1 trauma center. Two hundred forty-one patients who were treated through a posterior approach with a minimum of 6-month radiographic follow-up were identified from an acetabular fracture database. None. The occurrence and severity (Brooker Grade III/IV) of HO 6 months postsurgery. Length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), non-ICU LOS>10 days, and HO prophylaxis with external radiation beam therapy (XRT) were significantly associated with the development of HO in a multivariate model [ 1-2 days, odds ratio (OR) = 4.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-18.25; 3-6 days, OR = 4.1, 95% CI, 1.27-13.27;>6 days, OR = 11.7, 95% CI, 3.24-42.22; non-ICU LOS>10 days (vs. 0-6 days): OR = 7.6, 95% CI, 2.6-22.25; XRT HO prophylaxis: OR = 0.29, 95% CI, 0.10-0.85]. Other variables evaluated in multivariate modeling not significantly associated with development and severity of HO included age, gender, mechanism of injury, injury severity score, presence of neurologic injury, Letournel fracture type, occurrence of hip dislocation, interval from injury to surgery, operative time, and estimated blood loss. answer: Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.	maybe
question: Does obstructive sleep apnea affect aerobic fitness? context: We sought to determine whether patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) had an objective change in aerobic fitness during cycle ergometry compared to a normal population. The most accurate test of aerobic fitness is measurement of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) with cycle ergometry. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis (247 patients with OSA) of VO2max from annual cycle ergometry tests compared to a large control group (normative data from 1.4 million US Air Force tests) in a tertiary care setting. Overall, individuals with OSA had increased VO2max when compared to the normalized US Air Force data (p<.001). Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 demonstrated a decreased VO2max as compared to normalized values (p<.001). No differences in VO2max were observed after either medical or surgical therapy for OSA. answer: Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.	maybe
question: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement? context: Emergency surgery is associated with poorer outcomes and higher mortality with recent studies suggesting the 30-day mortality to be 14-15%. The aim of this study was to analyse the 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality following emergency laparotomy. We hope this will encourage prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiate strategies to establish best practice in this area. This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent emergency laparotomy from June 2010 to May 2012. The primary end point of the study was 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality. 477 laparotomies were performed in 446 patients. 57% were aged<70 and 43% aged>70 years. 30-day mortality was 12, 4% in those aged<70 years and 22% in those>70 years (p<0.001). 1-year mortality was 25, 15% in those aged under 70 years and 38% in those aged>70 years (p<0.001). answer: Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.	maybe
question: Combining process indicators to evaluate quality of care for surgical patients with colorectal cancer: are scores consistent with short-term outcome? context: To determine if composite measures based on process indicators are consistent with short-term outcome indicators in surgical colorectal cancer care. Longitudinal analysis of consistency between composite measures based on process indicators and outcome indicators for 85 Dutch hospitals. The Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit database, the Netherlands. 4732 elective patients with colon carcinoma and 2239 with rectum carcinoma treated in 85 hospitals were included in the analyses. All available process indicators were aggregated into five different composite measures. The association of the different composite measures with risk-adjusted postoperative mortality and morbidity was analysed at the patient and hospital level. At the patient level, only one of the composite measures was negatively associated with morbidity for rectum carcinoma. At the hospital level, a strong negative association was found between composite measures and hospital mortality and morbidity rates for rectum carcinoma (p<0.05), and hospital morbidity rates for colon carcinoma. answer: For individual patients, a high score on the composite measures based on process indicators is not associated with better short-term outcome. However, at the hospital level, a good score on the composite measures based on process indicators was consistent with more favourable risk-adjusted short-term outcome rates.	maybe
question: Are the elderly with oropharyngeal carcinoma undertreated? context: To determine if elderly patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are receiving less treatment and to evaluate the benefit of aggressive therapy in this population. Retrospective analysis of a large population database. Patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database with OPSCC diagnosed from 2004 to 2009 were included. The patients were categorized into age groups 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 years and older, then further categorized by treatment status. Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease-specific survival (DSS) for late-stage (III and IV) OPSCC was performed for all age and treatment categories, followed by a multivariate cox regression of treatment status, tumor site, race, stage, and sex per age group. A total of 14,909 patients with OPSCC were identified. In our demographic data, we observed a significant increase in the number of patients who did not receive treatment (surgery, radiation, or combined therapy) after age 55. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that age groups 65 to 74 and 75 to 84 had substantial benefits in DSS with surgery, radiation, or combined therapy. Multivariable analysis did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in the hazard ratios for combined treatment among age groups 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84. answer: Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.	maybe
question: Do older patients receive adequate stroke care? context: National guidelines and government directives have adopted policies for urgent assessment of patients with a transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke not admitted to hospital. The risk of recurrent stroke increases substantially with age, as does the potential benefit of secondary prevention. In order to develop effective strategies for older patients, it is important to identify how stroke care is currently provided for this patient group. Between 2004 and 2006, older patients (>75 years) referred to a neurovascular clinic were compared with younger patients (<or =75 years). Sociodemographic details, clinical features, resource use and secondary prevention in a neurovascular clinic were collected. Of 379 patients referred to the clinic, 129 (34%) were given a non-stroke diagnosis. Of the remaining 250 patients, 149 (60%) were<or =75 years. Median time from symptom onset to clinic appointment was similar for the two groups (24 (IQR 15-42) vs 24 (IQR 14-43) days; p = 0.58). Older patients were more likely to be in atrial fibrillation (10.1% vs 22.8%, p<0.001) and have lacunar stroke (34.7% vs 22.1%; p = 0.04). CT rates were similar in the two groups (27.8% vs 80.0%, p = 0.75). Scans were performed more quickly in younger patients (p<0.01). MRI scan rates were higher in younger patients (26% vs 4%, p<0.01), as was carotid Doppler imaging (92% vs 77%, p<0.01). There were no differences in prescribed secondary preventive treatments. Older patients experienced less delay for carotid endarterectomy (49 vs 90 days, p<0.01). Younger patients were more likely to be given advice on weight reduction (30.2% vs 12.9%, p<0.01) and diet (46.3% vs 31.7%, p = 0.02) than older patients. answer: Older patients were less likely to receive diagnostic investigations and lifestyle modification advice than younger patients. Guidelines need to be adopted to ensure prompt evidence-based stroke care in the outpatient setting.	maybe
question: Continuation of pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid administration: opportunity for rescue? context: To determine the duration of continuing pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid (AC) administration and to evaluate the potential opportunity for rescue AC. Retrospective analysis of women at 24-32 weeks' gestation who received AC at one institution. Six hundred ninety-two women received AC. Two hundred forty-seven (35.7%) delivered at>or = 34 weeks' gestation. Three hundred twenty-one (46.4%) delivered within 1 week of AC; 92 of those women (13.3%) delivered within 24 hours. Only 124 (17.9%) remained pregnant 1 week after AC and delivered at<34 weeks. The latter were compared to women delivering>2 week after AC but>or = 34 weeks. More likely to deliver at<34 weeks were those women who received AC for premature preterm rupture of membranes (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.06-7.17), twins (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.42-5.95) or before 28 weeks (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.38-3.52). answer: Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.	maybe
question: Should HIV-infected patients be screened for silent myocardial ischaemia using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT? context: A higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in HIV-infected patients, together with chronic infection and treatments, has resulted in an increased risk of silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI). The objective of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease. The prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV infection status, and treatment. Coronary artery disease was detected in nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p<0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01). All the positive myocardial SPECT scans were in men older than 52 years with at least two other CRFs. In this subpopulation of 47 patients, the prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT reached 19.2 %. answer: In male HIV-infected patients older than 52 years and with at least two other CRFs, screening for SMI using myocardial SPECT was about four times more likely to be positive than in the general population. This may motivate physicians to advise these patients to undergo more systematic screening for SMI using this technique.	maybe
question: Is a specialised training of phonological awareness indicated in every preschool child? context: In a prospective study 218 preschool children were enrolled (stratified in 2 training programs, one specialized for phonologic awareness in order to prevent dyslexia, the other consisting in training of general perception) during the last year of kindergarten. After finishing the first grade 131 children were compared in their reading and writing abilities. In the whole group only a slight difference was found between both training modalities concerning their writing abilities. However, children with a history of hearing loss, actual hearing loss or pathologic middle ear findings profited most from the specialized training program compared to the control in their reading abilities. answer: A specialized training program to improve phonologic awareness as a basis for reading and writing in every kindergarten and preschool child seems to be unnecessary. However, children with temporary hearing deficits benefit from such a program. For all other children general perception training may be sufficient.	maybe
question: BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR : are correlated results possible from homebrew assays? context: Quantitative real-time PCR has become the predominant molecular technique to monitor BCRABL levels in response to treatment in Ph(+) leukemia patients. However, without some form of standardized methodology between laboratories, the correlation of results is difficult. Using TaqMan-based assays, parallel quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed on 70 clinical specimens at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Virginia Commonwealth University. While the same positive control cell line (K562) and quality control gene (BCR) were used, the RNA isolation technique, cDNA synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences were different. The detection of BCRABL-positive results spanned a dynamic range from 10(0) to 10(5)/100,000 cells. Forty-three samples were negative at both facilities. A Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed for the 22 BCRABL-positive paired results. The correlation coefficient, r(s), was 0.9435 (p<0.00001), suggesting a strong correlation of the results. One discordant result was obtained for consecutive samples from one patient with a low BCRABL copy number as a result of a minimal RNA yield at one laboratory. answer: These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.	maybe
question: Does HER2 immunoreactivity provide prognostic information in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients receiving adjuvant M-VEC chemotherapy? context: To evaluate the impact of HER2 immunoreactivity on clinical outcome in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients who received surgery alone, or methotrexate, vinblastine, epirubicin, and cisplatin (M-VEC) as adjuvant chemotherapy. We studied 114 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients receiving surgery alone or adjuvant M-VEC. The authors evaluated HER2 immunoreactivity using immunohistochemical staining and explored the influence of pathological parameters and HER2 immunoreactivity on progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific overall survival (OS) using univariate and multivariate Cox's analyses. Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder had a significantly higher frequency of HER2 immunoreactivity than that of the upper urinary tract (60.7 vs. 20.7%, p<0.0001). Overall, nodal status was a strong and independent prognostic indicator for clinical outcome. The HER2 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with PFS (p = 0.02) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.005) in advanced urothelial carcinoma patients. As for patients with adjuvant M-VEC, HER2 immunoreactivity was a significant prognostic factor for PFS (p = 0.03) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.02) using univariate analysis, but not multivariate analysis, and not for patients receiving watchful waiting. answer: HER2 immunoreactivity might have a limited prognostic value for advanced urothelial carcinoma patients with adjuvant M-VEC.	maybe
question: Does the familial transmission of drinking patterns persist into young adulthood? context: Parental drinking has been shown to be associated with offspring drinking. However, the relationship appears to be more complex than often assumed and few studies have tracked it over longer time periods. To explore the long-term (10-year) transmission of familial drinking during adolescence to offspring drinking patterns in young adulthood. Swedish longitudinal study, assessing the relationship between familial drinking in 2000 and offspring drinking in 2010 using simultaneous quantile regression analysis (n=744).DATA: Data on familial drinking was gathered from the Swedish level-of-living surveys (LNU) and from partner LNU in 2000 while data on offspring drinking in young adulthood was gathered from LNU 2010. Drinking among offspring, parents and potential stepparents was measured through identical quantity-frequency indices referring to the past 12 months in 2010 and 2000 respectively. Young adults whose families were abstainers in 2000 drank substantially less across quintiles in 2010 than offspring of non-abstaining families. The difference, however, was not statistically significant between quintiles of the conditional distribution. Actual drinking levels in drinking families were not at all or weakly associated with drinking in offspring. Supplementary analyses confirmed these patterns. answer: The association between familial drinking and offspring drinking in young adulthood exhibits clear non-linear trends. Changes in the lower part of the familial drinking distribution are strongly related to drinking in young adults, but the actual levels of drinking in drinking families appear less important in shaping the drinking patterns of the offspring in young adulthood.	maybe
question: Bactericidal activity of 3 cutaneous/mucosal antiseptic solutions in the presence of interfering substances: Improvement of the NF EN 13727 European Standard? context: There is no standard protocol for the evaluation of antiseptics used for skin and mucous membranes in the presence of interfering substances. Our objective was to suggest trial conditions adapted from the NF EN 13727 standard, for the evaluation of antiseptics used in gynecology and dermatology. Three antiseptic solutions were tested in vitro: a chlorhexidine-benzalkonium (CB) combination, a hexamidine-chlorhexidine-chlorocresol (HCC) combination, and povidone iodine (P). The adaptation of trial conditions to the standard involved choosing dilutions, solvent, and interfering substances. The activity of solutions was assessed on the recommended strains at concentrations of 97% (pure solution), 50%, and 10% (diluted solution), and 1%. A logarithmic reduction ≥ 5 was expected after 60seconds of contact, to meet requirements of bactericidal activity. HCC did not present any bactericidal activity except on P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 97%. P was not bactericidal on E. hirae at any concentration and on S. aureus at 97%. CB had the most homogeneous bactericidal activity with a reduction>5 log on the 4 bacterial strains at concentrations of 97%, 50% and 10%. answer: Adapting the NF EN 13727 standard allowed assessing the 3 tested solutions: only CB was bactericidal in dirty conditions. This study proved the possibility of validating antiseptic choice in vitro, in current practice conditions, for adjunctive treatment of skin and mucous membranes disorders, primarily of bacterial origin or with a potential of superinfection.	maybe
question: Does ultrasound imaging before puncture facilitate internal jugular vein cannulation? context: To investigate whether prepuncture ultrasound evaluation of vascular anatomy facilitates internal jugular vein cannulation compared with landmark-guided puncture. Prospective randomized study. Single community hospital. Adult patients undergoing general anesthesia (n = 240). The right internal jugular vein was cannulated using either anatomic landmarks or prepuncture ultrasound (3.75/7.5 MHz) guidance. In the landmark group, respiratory jugular venodilation was used as the primary landmark for locating the vein. Results of cannulation and the incidence of complications were compared. Patients were randomly assigned to the ultrasound or landmark group. Respiratory jugular venodilation was identified in 188 patients (78.3%), in whom results of cannulation did not differ between the 2 techniques with respect to the venous access rate (cannulated at the first attempt: 83.5% in the landmark v 85.7% in the ultrasound group), the success rate (cannulated within 3 attempts: 96.9% v 95.6%), and the incidence of arterial puncture (1.0% v 3.3%). In the remaining 52 respiratory jugular venodilation-unidentified patients, the access rate (30.4% v 86.2%, p<0.001) and the success rate (78.3 v 100%, p<0.05) were significantly better in the ultrasound group, and no arterial puncture was recorded in the ultrasound group, whereas the incidence was 13.0% in the landmark group. The results were similar regardless of the ultrasound frequency used. answer: Prepuncture ultrasound evaluation did not improve the result of right internal jugular vein cannulation compared with the respiratory jugular venodilation-guided approach. When the landmark was not observed, however, the prepuncture ultrasound guidance was helpful in facilitating the cannulation.	maybe
question: Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably? context: Lymphedema may be identified by simpler circumference changes as compared with changes in limb volume. Ninety breast cancer patients were prospectively enrolled in an academic trial, and seven upper extremity circumferences were measured quarterly for 3 years. A 10% volume increase or greater than 1 cm increase in arm circumference identified lymphedema with verification by a lymphedema specialist. Sensitivity and specificity of several different criteria for detecting lymphedema were compared using the academic trial as the standard. Thirty-nine cases of lymphedema were identified by the academic trial. Using a 10% increase in circumference at two sites as the criterion, half the lymphedema cases were detected (sensitivity 37%). When using a 10% increase in circumference at any site, 74.4% of cases were detected (sensitivity 49%). Detection by a 5% increase in circumference at any site was 91% sensitive. answer: An increase of 5% in circumference measurements identified the most potential lymphedema cases compared with an academic trial.	maybe
question: Is perforation of the appendix a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy? context: To critically assess the evidence that appendiceal perforation is a risk factor for subsequent tubal infertility or ectopic pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies investigating the relationship between appendectomy and infertility or ectopic pregnancy were identified by searching the MEDLINE database from 1966 to 1997. Appropriate citations were also extracted from a manual search of the bibliographies of selected papers. Twenty-three articles were retrieved. Only 4 presented original data including comparisons to a nonexposed control group and they form the basis for this study. Because the raw data or specific techniques of data analysis were not always explicitly described, indices of risk for exposure were extracted from the data as presented and were analysed without attempting to convert them to a common measure. Articles were assessed according to the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on harm. Review of the literature yielded estimates of the risk of adverse fertility outcomes ranging from 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.5) for ectopic pregnancy after an appendectomy to 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9) for tubal infertility from perforation of the appendix. Recall bias, and poor adjustment for confounding variables in some reports, weakened the validity of the studies. answer: The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.	maybe
question: Does perspective-taking increase patient satisfaction in medical encounters? context: To assess whether perspective-taking, which researchers in other fields have shown to induce empathy, improves patient satisfaction in encounters between student-clinicians and standardized patients (SPs). In three studies, randomly assigned students (N = 608) received either a perspective-taking instruction or a neutral instruction prior to a clinical skills examination in 2006-2007. SP satisfaction was the main outcome in all three studies. Study 1 involved 245 third-year medical students from two universities. Studies 2 and 3 extended Study 1 to examine generalizability across student and SP subpopulations. Study 2 (105 physician assistant students, one university) explored the effect of perspective-taking on African American SPs' satisfaction. Study 3 (258 third-year medical students, two universities) examined the intervention's effect on students with high and low baseline perspective-taking tendencies. Intervention students outscored controls in patient satisfaction in all studies: Study 1: P = .01, standardized effect size = 0.16; Study 2: P = .001, standardized effect size = 0.31; Study 3: P = .009, standardized effect size = 0.13. In Study 2, perspective-taking improved African American SPs' satisfaction. In Study 3, intervention students with high baseline perspective-taking tendencies outscored controls (P = .0004, standardized effect size = 0.25), whereas those with low perspective-taking tendencies did not (P = .72, standardized effect size = 0.00). answer: Perspective-taking increased patient satisfaction in all three studies, across medical schools, clinical disciplines, and racially diverse students and SPs. Perspective-taking as a means for improving patient satisfaction deserves further exploration in clinical training and practice.	maybe
question: Sternal fracture in growing children : A rare and often overlooked fracture? context: Sternal fractures in childhood are rare. The aim of the study was to investigate the accident mechanism, the detection of radiological and sonographical criteria and consideration of associated injuries. In the period from January 2010 to December 2012 all inpatients and outpatients with sternal fractures were recorded according to the documentation. A total of 4 children aged 5-14 years with a sternal fracture were treated in 2 years, 2 children were hospitalized for pain management and 2 remained in outpatient care. answer: Isolated sternal fractures in childhood are often due to typical age-related traumatic incidents. Ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool for fracture detection and radiography is the method of choice for visualization of the extent of the dislocation.	maybe
question: Midwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location? context: Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women. This was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units. The response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006). answer: It is often assumed that midwives in rural areas where there are fewer deliveries, will be less competent and confident in their practice. Our exploratory study suggests that the issue of competence is far more complex and deserves further attention.	maybe
question: Does the severity of obstructive sleep apnea predict patients requiring high continuous positive airway pressure? context: To investigate polysomnographic and anthropomorphic factors predicting need of high optimal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Retrospective data analysis. Three hundred fifty-three consecutive obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients who had a successful manual CPAP titration in our sleep disorders unit. The mean optimal CPAP was 9.5 +/- 2.4 cm H2O. The optimal CPAP pressure increases with an increase in OSA severity from 7.79 +/- 2.2 in the mild, to 8.7 +/- 1.8 in the moderate, and to 10.1 +/- 2.3 cm H2O in the severe OSA group. A high CPAP was defined as the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD;>or =12 cm H2O). The predictor variables included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). High CPAP was required in 2 (6.9%), 6 (5.8%), and 63 (28.6%) patients with mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. On univariate analysis, AHI, BMI, ESS score, and the proportion of males were significantly higher in those needing high CPAP. They also have a lower MSLT mean. On logistic regression, the use of high CPAP was 5.90 times more frequent (95% confidence interval 2.67-13.1) in severe OSA patients after adjustment for the other variables. The area under the receiver operator curve was 72.4%, showing that the model was adequate. answer: Severe OSA patients are much more likely to need high CPAP levels. However, because of the low positive predictive value (only 28.6%), the clinical value of such information is limited. ESS and MSLT did not increase the predictive value for the need for high CPAP.	maybe
question: Does self-efficacy mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and healthcare workers' sleep quality? context: Although there is evidence for the influential role of transformational leadership on health outcomes, researchers have used either attitude outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction) or softer health measures, such as general well-being. Specific measures of well-being such as sleep quality have not been used, despite its association with working conditions. A longitudinal design was used to collect data from Danish healthcare workers at time 1 in 2005 (n = 447) and 18 months later at time 2 in 2007 (n = 274). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the relationships between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and sleep quality at both time points independently (cross-sectionally) and longitudinally. For all constructs, time 2 measures were influenced by the baseline level. Direct relationships between transformational leadership and sleep quality were found. This relationship was negative cross-sectionally at both time points, but positive between baseline and follow-up. The relationship between leadership and employees' sleep quality was not mediated by employees' self-efficacy. answer: Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.	maybe
question: Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone populations in manitoba? context: Francophones may experience poorer health due to social status, cultural differences in lifestyle and attitudes, and language barriers to health care. Our study sought to compare mental health indicators between Francophones and non-Francophones living in the province of Manitoba. Two populations were used: one from administrative datasets housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy and the other from representative survey samples. The administrative datasets contained data from physician billings, hospitalizations, prescription drug use, education, and social services use, and surveys included indicators on language variables and on self-rated health. Outside urban areas, Francophones had lower rates of diagnosed substance use disorder (rate ratio [RR] = 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95) and of suicide and suicide attempts (RR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79), compared with non-Francophones, but no differences were found between the groups across the province in rates of diagnosed mood disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia, or any mental disorders after adjusting for age, sex, and geographic area. When surveyed, Francophones were less likely than non-Francophones to report that their mental health was excellent, very good, or good (66.9%, compared with 74.2%). answer: The discrepancy in how Francophones view their mental health and their rates of diagnosed mental disorders may be related to health seeking behaviours in the Francophone population. Community and government agencies should try to improve the mental health of this population through mental health promotion and by addressing language and cultural barriers to health services.	maybe
question: Outcome Feedback within Emergency Medicine Training Programs: An Opportunity to Apply the Theory of Deliberate Practice? context: Outcome feedback is the process of learning patient outcomes after their care within the emergency department. We conducted a national survey of Canadian Royal College emergency medicine (EM) residents and program directors to determine the extent to which active outcome feedback and follow-up occurred. We also compared the perceived educational value of outcome feedback between residents and program directors. We distributed surveys to all Royal College-accredited adult and pediatric EM training programs using a modified Dillman method. We analyzed the data using student's t-test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. We received 210 completed surveys from 260 eligible residents (80.8%) and 21 of 24 program directors (87.5%) (overall 81.3%). Mandatory active outcome feedback was not present in any EM training program for admitted or discharged patients (0/21). Follow-up was performed electively by 89.4% of residents for patients admitted to the hospital, and by 44.2% of residents for patients discharged home. A majority of residents (76.9%) believed that patient follow-up should be mandatory compared to 42.9% of program directors (p=0.002). The perceived educational value of outcome feedback was 5.8/7 for residents and 5.1/7 for program directors (difference 0.7; p=0.002) based on a seven-point Likert scale (1=not important; 7=very important). answer: While Canadian EM training programs do not mandate follow-up, it is performed electively by the majority of residents surveyed. Residents place a significantly greater educational value on outcome feedback than their program directors, and believe that follow-up should be a mandatory component of EM residencies.	maybe
