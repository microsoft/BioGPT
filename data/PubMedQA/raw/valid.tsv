question: Is cytokeratin immunoreactivity useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea? context: Cytokeratin 7/20 staining has been reported to be helpful in diagnosing Barrett's oesophagus and gastric intestinal metaplasia. However, this is still a matter of some controversy. To determine the diagnostic usefulness of cytokeratin 7/20 immunostaining for short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea. In patients with Barrett's oesophagus, diagnosed endoscopically, at least two biopsy specimens were taken from just below the squamocolumnar junction. If goblet cells were found histologically with alcian blue staining, cytokeratin 7/20 immunohistochemical stains were performed. Intestinal metaplasia at the cardia was diagnosed whenever biopsy specimens taken from within 2 cm below the oesophagogastric junction revealed intestinal metaplasia. Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern was defined as cytokeratin 20 positivity in only the superficial gland, combined with cytokeratin 7 positivity in both the superficial and deep glands. Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern was observed in 28 out of 36 cases (77.8%) with short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, 11 out of 28 cases (39.3%) with intestinal metaplasia at the cardia, and nine out of 61 cases (14.8%) with gastric intestinal metaplasia. The sensitivity and specificity of Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern were 77.8 and 77.5%, respectively. answer: Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.	yes
question: Is extended aortic replacement in acute type A dissection justifiable? context: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our surgical strategy for acute aortic dissection based on the extent of the dissection and the site of the entry, with special emphasis on resection of all dissected aortic segments if technically possible. Between January 1995 and March 2001, 43 consecutive patients underwent operations for acute aortic dissection. In all patients the distal repair was performed under circulatory arrest without the use of an aortic cross-clamp. Fifteen patients underwent aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels in 3 patients. Complete replacement of all dissected tissue could be achieved in 21 patients (group 1). Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 patients (group 2). Early mortality was 4.7% (2 patients), and the incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events was 7.0% (3 patients). All of these events occurred in group 2 (p<0.025). During the follow-up period of 6 years or less, 5 patients died, all from causes not related to the aorta or the aortic valve. A persisting patent false lumen was observed in 14 of the 36 surviving patients (39%). answer: Extended replacement of the dissected ascending aorta and aortic arch can be done with good early and midterm results, even though it requires a complex surgical technique. Therefore we advocate complete replacement of the dissected parts of the aorta in all patients in whom this is technically possible.	yes
question: Is double-balloon enteroscopy an accurate method to diagnose small-bowel disorders? context: The aim of this study was to analyze the contribution of the double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) for diagnosis of the small bowel disorders. Forty-four patients (20 women, 24 men; mean age 53.5 years-old, range 21-89 years) with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea, polyposis, weight-loss, Roux-en-Y surgery, and other indications underwent DBE. Twenty patients had occult or obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. The source of bleeding was identified in 15/20 (75%): multiple angiodysplasias in four, arterial-venous malformation beyond the ligament of Treitz in two that could be treated with injection successfully. Other diagnoses included: duodenal adenocarcinoma, jejunal tuberculosis, erosions and ulcer of the jejunum. Of 24 patients with other indications, the diagnosis could be achieved in 18 of them (75%), including: two lymphomas, plasmocytoma, Gardner's syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers' syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Behçet's disease, jejunal submucosal lesion, lymphangiectasia due to blastomycosis and unspecific chronic jejunitis. Of three cases with Roux-en-Y reconstruction, two underwent DBE in order to perform biopsies of the excluded duodenum. Additionally, two patients underwent DBE to exclude Crohn's disease and lymphoma of the small bowel. The mean length of small bowel examination was 240 +/- 50 cm during a single approach. The diagnostic yield was 75% (33/44 cases) and therapeutic yield was 63.6%. No major complications were observed, only minor complication such as sore throat in 4/44 (9.1%). answer: 1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.	yes
question: Does tranexamic acid reduce desmopressin-induced hyperfibrinolysis? context: Desmopressin releases tissue-type plasminogen activator, which augments cardiopulmonary bypass--associated hyperfibrinolysis, causing excessive bleeding. Combined use of desmopressin with prior administration of the antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid may decrease fibrinolytic activity and might improve postoperative hemostasis. This prospective randomized study was carried out with 100 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operations between April 1999 and November 2000 in Gülhane Military Medical Academy. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Desmopressin (0.3 microg/kg) was administrated just after cardiopulmonary bypass and after protamine infusion in group 1 (n = 50). Both desmopressin and tranexamic acid (before the skin incision at a loading dose of 10 mg/kg over 30 minutes and followed by 12 hours of 1 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)) were administrated in group 2 (n = 50). Significantly less drainage was noted in group 2 (1010 +/- 49.9 mL vs 623 +/- 41.3 mL, P =.0001). Packed red blood cells were transfused at 2.1 +/- 0.5 units per patient in group 1 versus 0.9 +/- 0.3 units in group 2 (P =.0001). Fresh frozen plasma was transfused at 1.84 +/- 0.17 units per patient in group 1 versus 0.76 +/- 0.14 units in group 2 (P =.0001). Only 24% of patients in group 2 required donor blood or blood products compared with 74% of those in the isolated desmopressin group (group 1, P =.00001). Group 1 and group 2 findings were as follows: postoperative fibrinogen, 113 +/- 56.3 mg/dL versus 167 +/- 45.8 mg/dL (P =.0001); fibrin split product, 21.2 +/- 2.3 ng/mL versus 13.5 +/- 3.4 ng/mL (P =.0001); and postoperative hemoglobin level, 7.6 plus minus 1.2 g/dL versus 9.1 plus minus 1.2 g/dL (P =.0001). answer: Tranexamic acid administration significantly reduces desmopressin and bypass-induced hyperfibrinolysis. Combined use of tranexamic acid and desmopressin decreases both postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirement.	yes
question: Should ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics? context: Ascitis and undernutrition are frequent complications of cirrhosis, however ascitis volume and anthropometric assessment are not routinely documented or considered in prognostic evaluation. In a homogeneous cohort followed during two years these variables were scrutinized, aiming to ascertain relevance for longterm outcome. Population (N = 25, all males with alcoholic cirrhosis) was recruited among patients hospitalized for uncomplicated ascitis. Exclusion criteria were refractory or tense ascitis, cancer, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bleeding varices and critical illness. Measurements included ultrasonographically estimated ascitis volume, dry body mass index/BMI , upper arm anthropometrics, hematologic counts and liver function tests. Population (age 48.3 ± 11.3 years, BMI 21.1 ± 3.5 kg/m², serum albumin 2.5 ± 0.8 g/dL) was mostly in the Child-Pugh C category (77.8%) but clinically stable. During the follow-up period of 22.6 ± 3.8 months, additional hospitalizations numbered 1.7 ± 1.0 and more than one quarter succumbed. Admission ascitis volume corresponded to 7.1 ± 3.6 L and dry BMI to 18.3 ± 3.5 kg/m². Child Pugh index was relevant for both mortality and rehospitalization. Nevertheless, similar matches for mortality were documented with ascitis volume and dry BMI, and arm circumference below the 5th percentile was highly significantly associated with rehospitalization. answer: A greater association than hitherto acknowledged, between ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements from one side, and long-term rehospitalization and mortality from the other, was demonstrated in male stable alcoholic cirrhotics. Further studies with alcoholic and other modalities of cirrhosis including women are recommended.	yes
question: Esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy in portal hypertension: safe and effective? context: Esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication of portal hypertension. In this study, we compared the therapeutic effect of a novel surgical procedure, esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy (EDWS), with the widely used modified esophagogastric devascularization (MED) with splenectomy for the treatment of portal hypertension. Fifty-five patients with portal hypertension were included in this retrospective study. Among them, 27 patients underwent EDWS, and the other 28 patients underwent MED. Patients' characteristics, perioperative parameters and long-term follow-up were analyzed. The portal venous pressure was decreased by 20% postoperatively in both groups. The morbidity rate of portal venous system thrombosis in the EDWS group was significantly lower than that in the MED group (P=0.032). The 1- and 3-year recurrence rates of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage were 0% and 4.5% in the EDWS group, and 0% and 8.7% in the MED group, respectively (P=0.631). answer: EDWS is a safe and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.	yes
question: Does the leukocyte count correlate with the severity of injury? context: Injury severity score (ISS), Glasgow coma score (GCS), and revised trauma score (RTS) are the most frequently used methods to evaluate the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients. ISS is too complicated to assess easily and GCS and RTS are easy to assess but somewhat subjective. White blood cell count (WBC) is an easy, quick and objective test. This study was performed to evaluate the significance of the WBC count at presentation in the blunt trauma patients. 713 blunt trauma patients, who were admitted to the Uludag University Medical Center Emergency Department between 01.04.2000-31.12.2000, were retrospectively evaluated in terms of ISS, GCS, RTS and white blood cell count at presentation. Statistical analysis revealed that WBC was correlated positively with ISS, but negatively with GCS and RTS. answer: The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.	yes
question: Elephant trunk in a small-calibre true lumen for chronic aortic dissection: cause of haemolytic anaemia? context: The elephant trunk technique for aortic dissection is useful for reducing false lumen pressure; however, a folded vascular prosthesis inside the aorta can cause haemolysis. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an elephant trunk in a small-calibre lumen can cause haemolysis. Inpatient and outpatient records were retrospectively reviewed. Two cases of haemolytic anaemia after aortic surgery using the elephant trunk technique were identified from 2011 to 2013. A 64-year-old man, who underwent graft replacement of the ascending aorta for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection, presented with enlargement of the chronic dissection of the descending aorta and moderate aortic regurgitation. A two-stage surgery was scheduled. Total arch replacement with an elephant trunk in the true lumen and concomitant aortic valve replacement were performed. Postoperatively, he developed severe haemolytic anaemia because of the folded elephant trunk. The anaemia improved after the second surgery, including graft replacement of the descending aorta. Similarly, a 61-year-old man, who underwent total arch replacement for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection, presented with enlargement of the chronic dissection of the descending aorta. Graft replacement of the descending aorta with an elephant trunk inserted into the true lumen was performed. The patient postoperatively developed haemolytic anaemia because of the folded elephant trunk, which improved after additional stent grafting into the elephant trunk. answer: A folded elephant trunk in a small-calibre lumen can cause haemolysis. Therefore, inserting an elephant trunk in a small-calibre true lumen during surgery for chronic aortic dissection should be avoided.	yes
question: Can medical students contribute to quality assurance programmes in day surgery? context: Health care delivery has undertaken a major shift from inpatient management to ambulatory surgical care with increasing emphasis on quality assurance (QA) processes. Educational opportunities for medical undergraduate programmes are being sought in the day surgery environment. Our study was undertaken to explore ways in which senior medical students can actively contribute to QA processes as part of an undergraduate day surgery educational programme. Health care delivery has undertaken a major shift from inpatient management to ambulatory surgical care with increasing emphasis on quality assurance (QA) processes. Educational opportunities for medical undergraduate programmes are being sought in the day surgery environment. Our study was undertaken to explore ways in which senior medical students can actively contribute to the QA processes as part of an undergraduate day surgery educational programme. Fifty-nine final year medical students followed allocated patients with common surgical conditions through all phases of the day surgery process. Students kept records about each case in a log book and also presented their cases at weekly Problem Based Learning tutorials. An audit of student log books and review of tutorial records was conducted for the 1996 and 1997 academic years, in order to evaluate student contribution to QA. Students followed 621 cases, representing a sampling of 14. 1% day surgery cases. Categories of problems highlighted by students included inappropriate patient and procedure selection, inadequate pain management, discharge, communication and resource issues. Students made a number of recommendations including the development of multilingual videotapes and patient information sheets for non-English speaking patients, avoidance of bilateral surgical procedures and improved links with local medical officers. They also developed new guidelines and protocols. answer: Our study confirms that students are able to identify QA issues and propose solutions. We recommend that students have a formally recognized place in day surgery QA programmes, to close the QA loop and to adequately prepare them for medical practice in the 21st century.	yes
question: Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable? context: Measurement of basal metabolic rate (BMR) is suggested as a tool to estimate energy requirements. Therefore, BMR prediction equations have been developed in multiple populations because indirect calorimetry is not always feasible. However, there is a paucity of data on BMR measured in overweight and obese adults living in Asia and equations developed for this group of interest. The aim of this study was to develop a new BMR prediction equation for Chinese adults applicable for a large BMI range and compare it with commonly used prediction equations. Subjects were 121 men and 111 women (age: 21-67 years, BMI: 16-41 kg/m(2)). Height, weight, and BMR were measured. Continuous open-circuit indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system for 30 min was used to measure BMR. A regression equation was derived using stepwise regression and accuracy was compared to 6 existing equations (Harris-Benedict, Henry, Liu, Yang, Owen and Mifflin). Additionally, the newly derived equation was cross-validated in a separate group of 70 Chinese subjects (26 men and 44 women, age: 21-69 years, BMI: 17-39 kg/m(2)). The equation developed from our data was: BMR (kJ/d) = 52.6 x weight (kg) + 828 x gender + 1960 (women = 0, men = 1; R(2) = 0.81). The accuracy rate (within 10 % accurate) was 78 % which compared well to Owen (70 %), Henry (67 %), Mifflin (67 %), Liu (58 %), Harris-Benedict (45 %) and Yang (37 %) for the whole range of BMI. For a BMI greater than 23, the Singapore equation reached an accuracy rate of 76 %. Cross-validation proved an accuracy rate of 80 %. answer: To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.	yes
question: Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment? context: Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ). Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test. Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05). answer: This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of "significant" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.	yes
question: Emergency double-balloon enteroscopy combined with real-time viewing of capsule endoscopy: a feasible combined approach in acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding? context: There are few data concerning emergency double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and its usefulness in the management of severe acute obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate emergency DBE and capsule endoscopy (CE) in patients with overt OGIB, analyzing the feasibility of this combined approach. Emergency DBE in patients with overt OGIB was defined as performance within 24 h of symptom onset. We reported 27 patients (16 men, mean age: 64.6 ± 17.9 years) with overt severe bleeding who underwent 29 emergency DBE (22 anterograde, 7 retrograde). Of 27 patients, 16 (59.3%) underwent CE with real time (RT) viewing. Patients were diagnosed with the following: Dieulafoy's lesion (DL; n = 11, 40.7%), angioectasia (n = 7, 25.9%), tumors (n = 4, 14.8%), diverticulum (n = 3, 11.1%), ulcers (n = 2, 7.4%). We diagnosed 23 lesions amenable to endoscopic hemostasis and successfully treated 21 of them (77.8%). DL detection rate was statistically higher in the emergency DBE group than in OGIB patients with DBE done 24 h after symptom onset (40.7% vs 0.9%, respectively, P < 0.001). Combined approach with RT viewing by CE correctly modified DBE management in four patients (25%). answer: Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.	yes
question: Does psychological distress predict disability? context: To evaluate psychological distress as a predictor of disability due to common chronic disorders. A 10-year follow-up study was carried out among a representative cohort (N = 8655) of 18-64 year old Finnish farmers, who had participated in a health survey in 1979 and were able to work at baseline. A record linkage with the nationwide register of the Social Insurance Institution was made to identify disability pensions granted between 1980 and 1990 in the cohort. The medical certificates of 1004 (11.6%) prematurely retired farmers were reviewed to confirm and classify disabling conditions. A sum score based on self-reports of 11 symptoms at the baseline was used as a measure of psychological distress. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking and body mass index, the cause-specific relative risks (RR) (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of disability in the highest quartile of the psychological distress score as compared with the lowest quartile were for myocardial infarction 2.34 (95% CI: 1.17-4.69), for depression 2.50 (95% CI: 1.09-5.72), for neck-shoulder disorders 1.98 (95% CI: 1.26-3.11), for unspecified low-back disorders 1.76 (95% CI: 1.24-2.49), for knee osteoarthritis 1.55 (95% CI: 0.91-2.63) and for trip osteoarthritis 0.89 (95% CI: 0.42-1.85). The corresponding RR for overall disability was 1.76 (95% CI: 1.44-2.14) in the highest quartile of psychological distress score as compared with the lowest quartile. answer: Psychological distress is an independent risk factor for disability. Its predictive significance varies between disorders leading to functional deterioration. The association mechanisms are likely to vary from one disorder to another.	yes
question: Is acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia the expression of immune dysregulation? context: Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is a recently described histologic pattern of diffuse pulmonary disease. In children, all cases reported to date have been fatal. In this study, we describe the first nonfatal AFOP in a child and review the literature. A 10-year-old boy developed very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) after being admitted to our hospital with a fulminant hepatic failure of unknown origin. A chest computed tomography scan revealed multiple lung nodules and a biopsy of a pulmonary lesion showed all the signs of AFOP. Infectious workup remained negative. We started immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine to treat VSAA. Subsequent chest computed tomography scans showed a considerable diminution of the lung lesions but the VSAA did not improve until we performed hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 5 months later. answer: Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	yes
question: Inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients: is risk stratification useful? context: This study aimed to evaluate the utility of risk stratification of gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever (NF). A retrospective chart review of gynecologic cancer patients admitted with NF from 2007 to 2011 was performed, wherein demographic, oncologic, and NF characteristics (hospitalization length, complications, and death) were collected. The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index score was calculated; low risk was considered ≥ 21. SAS 9.2 was used for statistical analyses. Eighty-three patients met the study criteria. Most (92%) were Caucasian and had advanced stage disease (71%). Primary tumors were 58% ovary, 35% endometrium, and 6% cervix. All patients were receiving chemotherapy on admission (72% for primary, 28% for recurrent disease). Forty-eight percent had a positive culture, and most (58%) positive cultures were urine. Seventy-six percent of patients were considered low risk. High-risk patients were more likely to have a severe complication (10% versus 50%, p=0.0003), multiple severe complications (3% versus 20%, p=0.0278), ICU admission (2% versus 40%, p<0.0001), overall mortality (2% versus 15%, p=0.0417), and death due to neutropenic fever (0% versus 15%, p=0.0124). MASCC had a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%. The median MASCC score for all patients was 22 (range, 11-26), but the median MASCC score for those with death or a severe complication was 17 (range, 11-24). answer: Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.	yes
question: Do the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis? context: Acute pancreatitis is the major complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure and there are some reports showing cytokine changes in ERCP-induced pancreatits.GOALS: To investigate the association between early changes (within 24 hours) in the serum interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, and IL-6 levels and the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis.STUDY: Forty five consecutive patients who underwent therapeutic ERCP and 10 patients with acute pancreatitis without ERCP were enrolled to the study. Serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 were determined immediately before, 12 hours and 24 hours after ERCP. Seven of the 45 patients (15.5%) developed post-ERCP pancreatitis. The levels of IL-4 at 24 hours after ERCP were significantly lower in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis than in those without pancreatitis, while TNFalpha levels at 12 hours after ERCP were higher in the complicated group than those of the uncomplicated group. The ratios of TNFalpha/IL-4 at 12 and 24 hours after ERCP were found significantly higher in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis than in those without pancreatitis. IL-6 in the complicated patients was found significantly increased at 24 hours after ERCP. answer: The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.	yes
question: Scrotal approach to both palpable and impalpable undescended testes: should it become our first choice? context: To determine the advantages of scrotal incision in the treatment of undescended testis. Undescended testis is a common pediatric condition and is conventionally managed surgically by orchidopexy. A single scrotal incision orchidopexy has become accepted as a valid approach for patients with palpable undescended testicles. Because this approach also allows easy detection of atrophic testes or testicular remnants, it recently has also emerged as an alternative initial surgical approach to impalpable undescended testicles. All orchidopexies performed between 2004 and 2008 at our university hospital were prospectively included in this study. A total of 194 scrotal orchidopexies were performed in 154 patients (mean age, 71 months; range, 4-229 months). In all cases a scrotal approach was chosen irrespective of the initial position or presence of an open processus vaginalis. Testicular position was examined at follow-up after a mean period of 10 months (3-22 months). Overall, 36 of the 46 impalpable testicles (78%) could be diagnosed and treated accordingly, using only a scrotal incision. Conversion to laparoscopy was needed in 4 cases. A limited number of postoperative complications were seen. In all cases, the testes were palpable and remained in the scrotum on follow-up. answer: Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.	yes
question: Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients? context: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasonographic screening for primary hepatocellular carcinoma. A total of 680 eligible cases were classified into three groups (surveillance, opportunistic, and symptomatic groups) according to their initial exposure. We used survival time, tumor morphology, and T staging as prognostic outcomes. The outcomes of screened/unscreened and sur veillance/nonsur veillance were compared with the use of the logistic regression model. The adjusted odds ratios for the screened group versus the unscreened group, with 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival time being used as outcomes, were 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.52), 0.33 (95% CI, 0.21-0.53), and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.23-0.61), respectively. The adjusted odds ratios for surveillance versus nonsurveillance were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.35-0.97), 0.45 (95% CI, 0.27-0.74), and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.26-0.73). The odds ratios were even smaller when tumor morphology or T stage was taken as the main outcome. All these results were statistically significant. There were significant gradient relationships between prognostic outcomes and extent of screening history. answer: The significant impact of ultrasonographic screening on mortality reduction was demonstrated. These findings strongly suggest that early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma by ultrasound may improve the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.	yes
question: Systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring: is it helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry? context: The gap between evidence-based treatments and routine care has been well established. Findings from the Sequenced Treatments Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) emphasized the importance of measurement-based care for the treatment of depression as a key ingredient for achieving response and remission; yet measurement-based care approaches are not commonly used in clinical practice. The Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for monitoring depression severity was introduced in 19 diverse psychiatric practices. During the one-year course of the project the helpfulness and feasibility of implementation of PHQ-9 in these psychiatric practices were studied. The project was modeled after the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series. Two of the 19 practices dropped out during the course of the project. By the conclusion of the study, all remaining 17 practices had adopted PHQ-9 as a routine part of depression care in their practice. On the basis of responses from 17 psychiatrists from those practices, PHQ-9 scores influenced clinical decision making for 93% of 6,096 patient contacts. With the additional information gained from the PHQ-9 score, one or more treatment changes occurred during 40% of these clinical contacts. Changing the dosage of antidepressant medication and adding another medication were the most common treatment changes recorded by psychiatrists, followed by starting or increasing psychotherapy and by switching or initiating antidepressants. In 3% of the patient contacts, using the PHQ-9 led to additional suicide risk assessment. answer: The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.	yes
question: Does automatic transmission improve driving behavior in older drivers? context: Most older drivers continue to drive as they age. To maintain safe and independent transport, mobility is important for all individuals, but especially for older drivers. The objective of this study was to investigate whether automatic transmission, compared with manual transmission, may improve the driving behavior of older drivers. In total, 31 older drivers (mean age 75.2 years) and 32 younger drivers - used as a control group (mean age 39.2 years) - were assessed twice on the same fixed route; once in a car with manual transmission and once in a car with automatic transmission. The cars were otherwise identical. The driving behavior was assessed with the Ryd On-Road Assessment driving protocol. Time to completion of left turns (right-hand side driving) and the impact of a distraction task were measured. The older group had more driving errors than the younger group, in both the manual and the automatic transmission car. However, and contrary to the younger drivers, automatic transmission improved the older participants' driving behavior as demonstrated by safer speed adjustment in urban areas, greater maneuvering skills, safer lane position and driving in accordance with the speed regulations. answer: Switching to automatic transmission may be recommended for older drivers as a means to maintain safe driving and thereby the quality of their transport mobility.	yes
question: Is the holmium:YAG laser the best intracorporeal lithotripter for the ureter? context: To study the efficiency and safety of holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy for ureteral stones. A series of 188 patients with 208 ureteral stones were treated with semirigid ureteroscopy and holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy from January 2003 to December 2005. Of the stones, 116 were lower ureteral, 37 middle ureteral, and 55 upper ureteral. The success rate was 92.7% at the time of ureteroscopy and 96.7% at 3 months. The failures were secondary to retropulsion of the stones (3.3%). There were no perforations and one stricture. Stenting was done in 90% of patients. answer: The Holmium:YAG laser is an ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate and low morbidity.	yes
question: Is the h-index predictive of greater NIH funding success among academic radiologists? context: Despite rapid adoption of the Hirsch index (h-index) as a measure of academic success, the correlations between the h-index and other metrics of productivity remain poorly understood. The aims of this study were to determine whether h-indices were associated with greater National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding success among academic radiologists. Using the Scopus database, h-indices were calculated for a random sample of academic radiologists with the rank of professor. Using the NIH tool Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Reports, we determined the number, classification, and total years of NIH grant funding as principal investigator for each radiologist. Differences in h-index, sorted by funding status, were determined using Wilcoxon's tests. Associations between h-index and funding status were determined using logistic regression. Significant correlations between h-index and grant metrics were determined using Spearman's ρ. Among 210 professors of radiology, 48 (23%) secured at least one NIH grant. The mean h-index was significantly higher among individuals who secured at least one NIH grant (19.1) compared to those who did not (10.4) (P<.0001). Professors with h-indices<10 compared to those with h-indices>10 were significantly less likely to receive NIH funding (odds ratio, 0.07; P = .0321). However, h-indices>10 were not significantly predictive of greater funding. No significant relationships were observed between h-index and the number of grant awards, years of prior funding, the amounts of grant awards, or grant classification. answer: Having obtained at least one NIH grant was associated with a higher h-index, yet multiple or large grants, such as those for program projects, were not predictive of higher h-indices.	yes
question: Should early extubation be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery? context: We sought to determine the feasibility and assess the clinical outcomes associated with an early extubation strategy for all children undergoing congenital heart surgery, including neonates (age,<30 days). We performed a linked database analysis of all patients undergoing congenital heart surgery from July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012. We collected data on the cardiac diagnoses, preoperative status, procedure, and postoperative course, including the duration of invasive and noninvasive ventilation, failure of extubation, hemodynamic data, length of stay, complications, and mortality. A multivariable model was used to assess the independent factors associated with an inability to extubate within the operating room and with delayed extubation (>24 hours). We operated on 613 children, including 97 neonates. Intraoperative extubation was achieved in 71% of the cases and early extubation (≤ 24 hours) was achieved in 89% of the cases. The overall mortality was 1.5% (9 of 613 patients). Early extubation was associated with lower mortality (1% vs 9%, P<.001) and a lower rate of reintubation (4% vs 23%, P<.001) compared with delayed extubation. Notably, 63% of the neonates were extubated within 24 hours, including 67% of arterial switch operations and 54% of total anomalous pulmonary venous return repairs. Norwood operations were the only procedure in which no patient was extubated within the first 24 hours. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that the predictors of delayed extubation included preoperative mechanical ventilation, weight<5 kg, a longer procedure time, and the need for postoperative inotrope support. Implementation of an early extubation strategy was associated with low rates of complications (5.1 per 10 procedures), short lengths of intensive care unit stay (median, 1 day; interquartile range, 1-3), and short hospital stays (median, 4 days; interquartile range, 3-6). answer: Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.	yes
question: Is laparoscopic adrenalectomy safe and effective for adrenal masses larger than 7 cm? context: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) has become the gold standard treatment for small (less than 6 cm) adrenal masses. However, the role of LA for large-volume (more than 6 cm) masses has not been well defined. Our aim was to evaluate, retrospectively, the outcome of LA for adrenal lesions larger than 7 cm. 18 consecutive laparoscopic adrenalectomies were performed from 1996 to 2005 on patients with adrenal lesions larger than 7 cm. The mean tumor size was 8.3 cm (range 7-13 cm), the mean operative time was 137 min, the mean blood loss was 182 mL (range 100-550 mL), the rate of intraoperative complications was 16%, and in three cases we switched from laparoscopic procedure to open surgery. answer: LA for adrenal masses larger than 7 cm is a safe and feasible technique, offering successful outcome in terms of intraoperative and postoperative morbidity, hospital stay and cosmesis for patients; it seems to replicate open surgical oncological principles demonstrating similar outcomes as survival rate and recurrence rate, when adrenal cortical carcinoma were treated. The main contraindication for this approach is the evidence, radiologically and intraoperatively, of local infiltration of periadrenal tissue.	yes
question: Can predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation be omitted? context: The use of a balloon expandable stent valve includes balloon predilatation of the aortic stenosis before valve deployment. The aim of the study was to see whether or not balloon predilatation is necessary in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI). Sixty consecutive TAVI patients were randomized to the standard procedure or to a protocol where balloon predilatation was omitted. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding early hemodynamic results or complication rates. answer: TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.	yes
question: Does peritoneal dialysis affect halitosis in patients with end-stage renal disease? context: There are various causes of halitosis, one of which is chronic renal failure. The objective of this study was to investigate halitosis levels in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients before and after peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy. 42 subjects with ESRD were included in this study. The presence of halitosis was assessed using an organoleptic measurement and compared with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and salivary flow rates. Decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index and Community Periodontal Index (CPI) were calculated. All measurements were done before and after patients had received 3 months of PD therapy. Mean serum BUN level was found to be lower (46.05 ± 13.30 vs 91.24 ± 31.28 mg/dL), salivary flow rate higher (0.34 ± 0.07 vs 0.26 ± 0.04 mL/minute), and halitosis level lower (2.39 ± 0.60 vs 3.90 ± 0.37) at the end of 3 months of PD therapy than at the beginning of PD therapy. There was no significant difference in CPI or DMFT index before and after PD therapy (p>0.05). There was statistically significant positive correlation between the presence of halitosis and BUN levels (r = 0.702, p = 0.001 before PD; r = 0.45, p = 0.002 after PD) and a negative correlation between the presence of halitosis and salivary flow rates (r = -0.69, p = 0.000 before PD; r = -0.37, p = 0.01 after PD). answer: High BUN levels and low salivary flow rates were found to be associated with halitosis. PD may play an important role in decreasing the level of halitosis in ESRD patients.	yes
question: Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children? context: To assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT). The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group. In the LRT group, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group. answer: The short- and long-term outcomes after LRT and SLT did not differ significantly. To avoid the risk for the donor in LRT, SLT represents the first-line therapy in pediatric liver transplantation in countries where cadaveric organs are available. LRT provides a solution for urgent cases in which a cadaveric graft cannot be found in time or if the choice of the optimal time point for transplantation is vital.	yes
question: Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care? context: Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003. Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care). Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs. answer: The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.	no
question: Does the central venous pressure predict fluid responsiveness? context: Despite a previous meta-analysis that concluded that central venous pressure should not be used to make clinical decisions regarding fluid management, central venous pressure continues to be recommended for this purpose.AIM: To perform an updated meta-analysis incorporating recent studies that investigated indices predictive of fluid responsiveness. A priori subgroup analysis was planned according to the location where the study was performed (ICU or operating room). MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles. Clinical trials that reported the correlation coefficient or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between the central venous pressure and change in cardiac performance following an intervention that altered cardiac preload. From 191 articles screened, 43 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction. The studies included human adult subjects, and included healthy controls (n = 1) and ICU (n = 22) and operating room (n = 20) patients. Data were abstracted on study characteristics, patient population, baseline central venous pressure, the correlation coefficient, and/or the AUC between central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index and the percentage of fluid responders. Meta-analytic techniques were used to summarize the data. Overall 57% ± 13% of patients were fluid responders. The summary AUC was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58) with no heterogenicity between studies. The summary AUC was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.52-0.60) for those studies done in the ICU and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58) for those done in the operating room. The summary correlation coefficient between the baseline central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.1-0.25), being 0.28 (95% CI, 0.16-0.40) in the ICU patients, and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.02-0.21) in the operating room patients. answer: There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.	no
question: Is routine dissection of the station 9 lymph nodes really necessary for primary lung cancer? context: Mediastinal lymph node dissection is an essential component of lung cancer surgery; however, choosing mediastinal lymph nodes stations to be dissected is subjective. We carried out this research to investigate the need for dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during lung cancer surgery. Patients with primary lung cancer who underwent radical surgery between 2010 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical, pathologic, and prognosis data were obtained and analyzed. A total number of 1397 patients were included in this research. The metastasis rate of station 9 was 3.45%, which was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations. This metastasis rate was significantly correlated with pT stage, the lobe where the tumor was located, metastasis status of intrapulmonary lymph nodes, pTNM stage, and most of the other mediastinal lymph node stations. In males or ground glass opacity (GGO) patients, the metastasis of station 9 nodes was more unlikely to occur, even though there was no statistical significance. The staging results of most patients (99.63%) would not be impaired, even if station 9 nodes were not dissected, and the prognostic analysis showed that the metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on survival. answer: The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.	no
question: Can mass drug administration lead to the sustainable control of schistosomiasis? context: In the Philippines, the current national control strategy for schistosomiasis is annual mass drug administration (MDA) with 40 mg/kg of praziquantel in all schistosomiasis-endemic villages with a prevalence ≥10%. A cross-sectional survey of schistosomiasis was conducted in 2012 on 18 221 individuals residing in 22 schistosomiasis-endemic villages in the province of Northern Samar. The prevalence of schistosomiasis, intensity of Schistosoma infection, and morbidity of disease were assessed. Despite an active schistosomiasis-control program in Northern Samar for>30 years, which included a MDA campaign in the last 5 years, the mean prevalence of schistosomiasis among 10 435 evaluated subjects was 27.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.3%-28.0%), and the geometric mean intensity of infection among 2832 evaluated subjects was 17.2 eggs per gram of feces (95% CI, 16.4-18.1). Ultrasonography revealed high levels of schistosomiasis-induced morbidity in the schistosomiasis-endemic communities. Left lobe liver enlargement (≥70 mm) was evident in 89.3% of subjects. Twenty-five percent of the study population had grade II/III liver parenchyma fibrosis, and 13.3% had splenomegaly (≥100 mm). answer: MDA on its own was insufficient to control the prevalence of schistosomiasis, intensity of Schistosoma infection, or morbidity of the disease. Alternative control measures will be needed to complement the existing national MDA program.	no
question: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections in patients with Crohn's disease: are abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease contraindications? context: Because of the inflammatory nature of Crohn's disease, ileocolic resections are often difficult to perform, especially if an abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at a previous ileocolic anastomosis is present. Our goal was to determine whether the above factors are contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection. Between 1992 and 1996, 46 laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections were attempted. Fourteen patients had an abscess or phlegmon treated with bowel rest before operation (group I), 10 patients had recurrent Crohn's disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis (group II), and 22 patients had no previous operation and no phlegmon or abscess associated with their disease (group III). These groups were compared with each other and with 70 consecutive open ileocolic resections for Crohn's disease during the same time period (group IV). Operative blood loss and time were greater in group IV than in groups I, II, and III (245 versus 151, 131, and 195 ml, respectively, and 202 versus 152, 144, and 139 minutes, respectively). Conversion to open procedure occurred in 5 patients (group I, 1 [7%]; group II, 2 [20%]; group III, 2 [9%]). Morbidity was highest in group IV (21% versus 0%, 10%, and 10%, respectively). Only one patient died (group IV, 1%). Length of hospital stay was longest in group IV (7.9 versus 4.8, 3.9, and 4.5 days, respectively). answer: The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.	no
question: Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness? context: Although observational data support an inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD), genetic HDL deficiency states often do not correlate with premature CHD. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) measurements were obtained in cases comprising 10 different mutations in LCAT, ABCA1 and APOA1 to further evaluate the relationship between low HDL resulting from genetic variation and early atherosclerosis. In a 1:2 case-control study of sex and age-related (+/-5 y) subjects (n=114), cIMT was nearly identical between cases (0.66+/-0.17 cm) and controls (0.65+/-0.18 cm) despite significantly lower HDL cholesterol (0.67 vs. 1.58 mmol/l) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 vs. 151.4 mg/dl) (P<0.05) answer: Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.	no
question: Does a family meetings intervention prevent depression and anxiety in family caregivers of dementia patients? context: Family caregivers of dementia patients are at increased risk of developing depression or anxiety. A multi-component program designed to mobilize support of family networks demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing depressive symptoms in caregivers. However, the impact of an intervention consisting solely of family meetings on depression and anxiety has not yet been evaluated. This study examines the preventive effects of family meetings for primary caregivers of community-dwelling dementia patients. A randomized multicenter trial was conducted among 192 primary caregivers of community dwelling dementia patients. Caregivers did not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive or anxiety disorder at baseline. Participants were randomized to the family meetings intervention (n = 96) or usual care (n = 96) condition. The intervention consisted of two individual sessions and four family meetings which occurred once every 2 to 3 months for a year. Outcome measures after 12 months were the incidence of a clinical depressive or anxiety disorder and change in depressive and anxiety symptoms (primary outcomes), caregiver burden and quality of life (secondary outcomes). Intention-to-treat as well as per protocol analyses were performed. A substantial number of caregivers (72/192) developed a depressive or anxiety disorder within 12 months. The intervention was not superior to usual care either in reducing the risk of disorder onset (adjusted IRR 0.98; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.38) or in reducing depressive (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient = -1.40; 95% CI -3.91 to 1.10) or anxiety symptoms (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient = -0.55; 95% CI -1.59 to 0.49). The intervention did not reduce caregiver burden or their health related quality of life. answer: This study did not demonstrate preventive effects of family meetings on the mental health of family caregivers. Further research should determine whether this intervention might be more beneficial if provided in a more concentrated dose, when applied for therapeutic purposes or targeted towards subgroups of caregivers.	no
question: Are interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy? context: To describe the interstitial fluid (ISF) and plasma pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). This was a prospective observational pharmacokinetic study. Meropenem (500 mg) was administered every 8 h. CVVHDF was targeted as a 2-3 L/h exchange using a polyacrylonitrile filter with a surface area of 1.05 m2 and a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min. Serial blood (pre- and post-filter), filtrate/dialysate and ISF concentrations were measured on 2 days of treatment (Profiles A and B). Subcutaneous tissue ISF concentrations were determined using microdialysis. A total of 384 samples were collected. During Profile A, the comparative median (IQR) ISF and plasma peak concentrations were 13.6 (12.0-16.8) and 40.7 (36.6-45.6) mg/L and the trough concentrations were 2.6 (2.4-3.4) and 4.9 (3.5-5.0) mg/L, respectively. During Profile B, the ISF trough concentrations increased by ∼40%. Meropenem ISF penetration was estimated at 63% (60%-69%) and 69% (65%-74%) for Profiles A and B, respectively, using comparative plasma and ISF AUCs. For Profile A, the plasma elimination t1/2 was 3.7 (3.3-4.0) h, the volume of distribution was 0.35 (0.25-0.46) L/kg, the total clearance was 4.1 (4.1-4.8) L/h and the CVVHDF clearance was 2.9 (2.7-3.1) L/h. answer: This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC≤4 mg/L).	no
question: Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator? context: One of the problems with manual resuscitators is the difficulty in achieving accurate volume delivery. The volume delivered to the patient varies by the physical characteristics of the person and method. This study was designed to compare tidal volumes delivered by the squeezing method, physical characteristics and education and practice levels. 114 individuals trained in basic life support and bag-valve-mask ventilation participated in this study. Individual characteristics were obtained by the observer and the education and practice level were described by the subjects. Ventilation was delivered with a manual resuscitator connected to a microspirometer and volumes were measured. Subjects completed three procedures: one-handed, two-handed and two-handed half-compression. The mean (standard deviation) volumes for the one-handed method were 592.84 ml (SD 117.39), two-handed 644.24 ml (SD 144.7) and two-handed half-compression 458.31 ml (SD 120.91) (p<0.01). Tidal volume delivered by two hands was significantly greater than that delivered by one hand (r = 0.398, p<0.01). The physical aspects including hand size, volume and grip power had no correlation with the volume delivered. There were slight increases in tidal volume with education and practice, but correlation was weak (r = 0.213, r = 0.281, r = 0.131, p<0.01). answer: The tidal volume delivered by a manual resuscitator shows large variations. There were significant differences in the volume delivered by compression methods, but physical characteristics are not a predictor of tidal volume delivery. The manual resuscitator is not a suitable device for accurate ventilation.	no
question: Metered-dose inhalers. Do health care providers know what to teach? context: The specific aim of this investigation was to evaluate the proficiency of health care providers and patients in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Health care providers, which include house staff, nurses, and respiratory care practitioners who provide care to patients with asthma in the primary general medicine clinic or the pulmonary medicine clinic of a university-county hospital in which patients were referred, were surveyed and assigned a performance score regarding the knowledge base of the appropriate use of metered-dose inhalers. Patients who attended the primary care general medicine and pulmonary subspecialty clinic were also assessed as to their proficiency in the use of metered-dose inhalers. A significant percentage of patients had a poor understanding of the technique used with the metered-dose inhaler. House staff and nursing staff were also less proficient in the proper use of the metered-dose inhaler. The respiratory care practitioners were the most knowledgeable of the health care providers. answer: This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.	no
question: Does high-dose radiotherapy benefit palliative lung cancer patients? context: The present analysis compares two palliative treatment concepts for lung cancer in terms of overall survival. Survival data from 207 patients were used in a retrospective analysis. All patients received palliative treatment comprising either 25 Gy applied in 5 fractions or 50 Gy in 20 fractions. A subgroup analysis was performed to compare patients with a good-fair vs. poor overall condition. Median survival times were 21 weeks (range 6-26 weeks) for patients treated with 25 Gy in 5 fractions and 23 weeks (range 14.5-31.5 weeks) for patients treated with 50 Gy in 20 fractions (95 % confidence interval, CI; p = 0.334). For patients with a good-fair overall condition, median survival times were 30 weeks (21.8-39.2 weeks) for 25 Gy in 5 fractions and 28 weeks (14.2-41.8 weeks) for 50 Gy in 20 fractions (CI 95 %, p = 0.694). In patients with a poor overall condition, these values were 18 weeks (14.5-21.5 weeks) and 21 weeks (13.0-29.0 weeks), respectively (CI 95 %, p = 0.248). answer: The palliative treatment concept of 25 Gy applied in 5 fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.	no
question: Does the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia exist? context: The placement of the superficial cervical plexus block has been the subject of controversy. Although the investing cervical fascia has been considered as an impenetrable barrier, clinically, the placement of the block deep or superficial to the fascia provides the same effective anesthesia. The underlying mechanism is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the three-dimensional organization of connective tissues in the anterior region of the neck. Using a combination of dissection, E12 sheet plastination, and confocal microscopy, fascial structures in the anterior cervical triangle were examined in 10 adult human cadavers. In the upper cervical region, the fascia of strap muscles in the middle and the fasciae of the submandibular glands on both sides formed a dumbbell-like fascia sheet that had free lateral margins and did not continue with the sternocleidomastoid fascia. In the lower cervical region, no single connective tissue sheet extended directly between the sternocleidomastoid muscles. The fascial structure deep to platysma in the anterior cervical triangle comprised the strap fascia. answer: This study provides anatomical evidence to indicate that the so-called investing cervical fascia does not exist in the anterior triangle of the neck. Taking the previous reports together, the authors' findings strongly suggest that deep potential spaces in the neck are directly continuous with the subcutaneous tissue.	no
question: Are physicians aware of the side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors? context: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are considered safe, but they are associated with characteristic side effects, namely cough and angioedema, usually requiring discontinuation. We perceived that referrals for these side effects have become more and more frequent; therefore, we evaluated the degree of knowledge on the safety of ACE-I in different medical categories. A questionnaire (13 questions) on side effects of ACE-I was posted to physicians. Everyday clinical practice. Cardiologists, allergists, and general practitioners (GPs) from the National Healthcare System. Three hundred twelve physicians were contacted, and 154 returned questionnaires that could be analyzed. Of the 154 physicians (mean age, 45 years) 48 were cardiologists, 52 were GPs, and 54 were allergists. The percentage of correct answers was low: 31.9% for cardiologists, 40% for GPs, and 33% for allergists. Thus, GPs provided a significantly higher percentage of correct answers with respect to the remaining categories (p = 0.05). The lower rate of correct answers (0 to 15.9%) concerned the time of onset of cough and the action to take. Cardiologists seemed to be less aware of the fact that angiotensin receptor blockers (sartans) can cross-react with ACE-I. answer: Overall, there was a poor knowledge of the side effects of ACE-I. This may account for the increased referrals for chronic cough and angioedema.	no
question: Does the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression result in cost savings? context: Several atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) are used as second-line agents for treatment resistant depression. AAPs can be expensive compared to other treatment options and can cause several side effects. To estimate healthcare costs and utilization of AAPs compared to other second-line agents. Observational study using Medicaid claims data (2006-2011). Subjects were depression-diagnosed adult members with at least two prescriptions of antidepressant medications followed by a second-line agent. Gamma generalized linear models (GLM) produced estimates of the difference in mean expenditures among treatment groups after adjusting for individual baseline characteristics using propensity scores. Negative binomial models produced estimates of the difference in number of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits. A total of 3910 members received second-line treatment. Treatment groups were AAPs (n = 2211), augmentation agents other than AAPs (n = 1008), and antidepressant switching (n = 691). AAPs resulted in higher mean adjusted pharmacy costs and higher mean adjusted total mental health-related costs. Mean adjusted total healthcare costs and number of inpatient and ED visits were not different among treatments. answer: The results show no evidence that AAPs used as second-line treatment for depression results in overall cost savings or lower inpatient and ED visits compared to other treatment strategies.	no
question: Spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels. Should one rely on the short gastric arteries? context: Knowing the collaterals is essential for a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels. To ascertain the sources of the blood supply to the spleen after a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels. Perfusion of the cadaveric left gastric and right gastroepiploic arteries with methylene blue after occlusion of all the arteries except the short gastric arteries (n=10). Intraoperative color Doppler ultrasound was used for the evaluation of the hilar arterial blood flow at distal pancreatectomy (n=23) after 1) clamping of the splenic artery alone, 2) clamping of the splenic and left gastroepiploic arteries and 3) clamping of the splenic and short gastric arteries. CT angiography of the gastric and splenic vessels before and after a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (n=10). Perfusion of the cadaveric arteries revealed no effective direct or indirect (through the submucous gastric arterial network) communication between the left gastric and the branches of the short gastric arteries. In no case did intraoperative color Doppler ultrasound detect any hilar arterial blood flow after the clamping of the splenic and left gastroepiploic arteries. The clamping of the short gastric arteries did not change the flow parameters. In none of the cases did a post-spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels CT angiography delineate the short gastric vessels supplying the spleen. In all cases, the gastroepiploic arcade was the main arterial pathway feeding the spleen. answer: Experimental, intra- and postoperative instrumental investigations did not show the short gastric arteries to be engaged in the blood supply to the spleen after a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels. In all cases, the left gastroepiploic artery was the main collateral vessel.	no
question: Diagnostic and therapeutic ureteroscopy: is dilatation of ureteral meatus always necessary? context: To assess the feasibility and safety of diagnostic or therapeutic semirigid ureteroscopy without ureteral meatus dilatation. A comparative, retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing ureteroscopy from January 2000 to May 2008. For data analysis purposes, the population was divided into two groups based on whether ureteroscopy had been performed with (Group 1) or without (Group 2) ureteral meatus dilatation. Variables recorded included age, sex, type of procedure, surgical diagnosis, passive or active dilatation, number of stones, stone location, stone diameter, peroperative and postoperative complications, internal urinary diversion after the procedure, therapeutic success rate, operating time, and hospital stay duration. A 8-9.8 Fr Wolf semirigid ureteroscope was used. Descriptive statistics of the population and cohorts were performed, providing medians, quartiles, and limit values for non-normally distributed interval variables, and absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables. Shapiro-Wilk's, Mann-Whitney's U, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. A value of p 2 alpha<or = 0.005 was considered statistically significant. Arcus Quickstat Biomedical 1.0 software was used. Among the 306 ureteroscopies studied, 286 performed in 256 patients were analyzed. Median age was 50 years (16-83), 59% of patients were male, and elective ureteroscopy was performed in 183 patients (64%). Group 1: 191 ureteroscopies, Group 2: 95 ureteroscopies. Stone location: 149 in distal ureter, 60 in middle ureter, and 35 in proximal ureter. Sixty-nine percent of stones had sizes ranging from 5 and 10 mm. The overall success rate was 86.5%. There were 5 peroperative and 22 postoperative complications, with no statistically significant differences between the groups. answer: In selected cases, ureteroscopy may be performed without ureteral meatus dilatation with success and morbidity rates similar to when the procedure is performed with meatal dilatation.	no
question: Do symptoms predict COPD in smokers? context: The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against spirometry in the absence of symptoms. However, as much as 50% of COPD cases in the United States remain undiagnosed. Report of symptoms, smoking history, and spirometric data were collected from subjects screened for a work-related medical evaluation (N = 3,955). Prevalence of airflow obstruction and respiratory symptoms were assessed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and relative risks of predicting symptoms and smoking history for COPD were calculated. Forty-four percent of smokers in our sample had airways obstruction (AO). Of these, 36% reported a diagnosis of or treatment for COPD. Odds ratio (95% CI) for AO with smoking (>or = 20 pack-years) was 3.73 (3.12- 4.45), 1.98 (1.73-2.27) for cough, 1.79 (1.55-2.08) for dyspnea, 1.95 (1.70-2.34) for sputum, and 2.59 (2.26-2.97) for wheeze. Respiratory symptoms were reported by 92% of smokers with AO, 86% smokers with restriction, 76% smokers with normal spirometry, and 73% of nonsmokers. Sensitivity (92% vs 90%), specificity (19% vs 22%), positive (47% vs 40%) and negative (75% vs 80%) predictive values for the presence of one or more symptoms were similar between smokers and all subjects. answer: COPD is underdiagnosed in the United States. Symptoms are frequent in subjects with AO and increase their risk for COPD, but add little beyond age and smoking history to the predictive value of spirometry. In view of the high prevalence of symptoms and their poor predictive value, a simpler and more effective approach would be to screen older smokers.	no
question: Actinobaculum schaalii, a cause of urinary tract infections in children? context: Urine samples were examined by wet smear microscopy, incubated in 5% CO(2) for 1-2 days, and species-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for A. schaalii was performed. In 5 of the 29 screened urines, A. schaalii was found only by real-time PCR in quantities equivalent to ≥ 10(4) -10(5) CFU/mL. In addition, A. schaalii was found in quantities equivalent to ≥ 10(6) CFU/mL by both culture and PCR in two children with a urinary tract infection and large numbers of leucocytes in the urine. answer: Actinobaculum schaalii is CO(2)-dependent. Therefore, if there are clinical symptoms and/or a negative culture despite the presence of leucocytes in the urine, Gram staining and incubation in 5% CO(2) or species-specific real-time PCR should be performed to identify A. schaalii.	maybe
question: Does accompanying metabolic syndrome contribute to heart dimensions in hypertensive patients? context: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events. We evaluated heart dimensions in hypertensive patients with MetS. The study included 75 hypertensive patients (34 males, 41 females; mean age 51+/-9 years) without coronary artery disease. Patients were evaluated in two groups depending on the presence or absence of MetS. Age- and gender-matched 20 healthy subjects (9 males, 11 females; mean age 50+/-5 years) comprised the control group. The diagnosis of MetS was based on the presence of at least three of five MetS criteria. Hypertension was defined as arterial blood pressure exceeding 140/85 mmHg on three consecutive measurements or the use of antihypertensive drugs. Echocardiographic measurements included interventricular septal thickness, left ventricular internal diameter, posterior wall thickness, aortic diameter, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass. Metabolic syndrome was present in 32 hypertensive patients (42.7%; 18 males, 14 females). The mean number of MetS criteria was 2.6+/-1.0 in the hypertensive group. Compared to the control group, patients with or without MetS exhibited significantly increased interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass (p<0.05). The only significant difference between the two patient groups was that MetS was associated with a greater left atrial diameter (p=0.019). Left atrial diameter was correlated with the number of MetS criteria (r=0.51; p<0.001). answer: Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.	maybe
question: Could different follow-up modalities play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses? context: To determine current practice and to assess the value of routine follow-up procedures for endometrial cancer surveillance. To discuss whether such procedures are feasible and effective to identify asymptomatic recurrences and describe the pattern of relapse detected by procedures. The records of 282 consecutive women with recurrent endometrial cancer treated from 1986 to 2005 were retrospectively collected in 8 Italian institutions. Primary disease, clinical history, and recurrence features and data were analyzed. Thirty-five (12.4%) of 282 patients had recurrence in vaginal vault, 51 patients (18.0%) had recurrence in central pelvis, 14 patients (4.9%) had recurrence in pelvic wall, and 39 patients (13.8%) had recurrence in lymph nodes. One-hundred twenty-eight patients (45.3%) showed a distant relapse, whereas 15 patients (5.3%) developed both distant relapse and local relapse. The site of relapse influenced survival because the patients with vaginal vault recurrences lived significantly longer than the patients with recurrences in other sites. Eighty (28.4%) of the 282 patients became symptomatic and anticipated the scheduled visit, 37 (13.1 %) of the patients reported their symptoms during the follow-up meeting, and 165 (58.5 %) of the patients were asymptomatic and the diagnostic path was introduced by a planned visit or examination. Among the asymptomatic patients, the first procedure that led to further examinations was clinical visit alone for 60 (36.4%) of 165 patients, imaging for 103 patients (62.4%), and cytologic examination for 2 patients (1.2%). Symptoms at recurrence can predict survival: patients with an asymptomatic recurrence had a median survival time from relapse of 35 months versus 13 months if they had a symptomatic repetition (P = 0.0001). answer: Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.	maybe
question: Can APC mutation analysis contribute to therapeutic decisions in familial adenomatous polyposis? context: In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), correlations between site of mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and severity of colonic polyposis or extracolonic manifestations are well known. While mutation analysis is important for predictive diagnosis in persons at risk, its relevance for clinical management of individual patients is open to question. We examined 680 unrelated FAP families for germline mutations in the APC gene. Clinical information was obtained from 1256 patients. APC mutations were detected in 48% (327/680) of families. Age at diagnosis of FAP based on bowel symptoms and age at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in untreated patients were used as indicators of the severity of the natural course of the disease. A germline mutation was detected in 230 of 404 patients who were diagnosed after onset of bowel symptoms (rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhoea). When these patients were grouped according to the different sites of mutations, mean values for age at onset of disease differed significantly: patients carrying APC mutations at codon 1309 showed a disease onset 10 years earlier (mean age 20 years) compared with patients with mutations between codons 168 and 1580 (except codon 1309) (mean age 30 years), whereas patients with mutations at the 5' end of codon 168 or the 3' end of codon 1580 were diagnosed at a mean age of 52 years. Within each group of patients however large phenotypic variation was observed, even among patients with identical germline mutations. A higher incidence of desmoids was found in patients with mutations between codons 1445 and 1580 compared with mutations at other sites, while no correlation between site of mutation and presence of duodenal adenomas was observed. answer: As age at manifestation and course of the disease may be rather variable, even in carriers of identical germline mutations, therapeutic decisions should be based on colonoscopic findings in individual patients rather than on the site of mutation. However, in patients with mutations within codons 1445-1580, it may be advisable to postpone elective colectomy because desmoids may arise through surgical intervention.	maybe
question: "Would a man smell a rose then throw it away? context: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy afflicting women, and the most common cancer overall in Jordan. A woman's decision to go for screening is influenced by her social support network. This study aims to explore Jordanian men's individual and contextual perspectives on women's breast cancer and their own role in the breast health of the females within their families. An explorative qualitative design was used to purposively recruit 24 married men aged 27 to 65 years (median 43 years) from four governorates in Jordan. Data in the form of interviews transcriptions was subjected to qualitative content analysis. Three themes were identified: a) Supporting one's wife; b) Marital needs and obligations; c) Constrained by a culture of destiny and shame. The first theme was built on men's feelings of responsibility for the family's health and well-being, their experiences of encouraging their wives to seek health care and their providing counselling and instrumental support. The second theme emerged from men's views about other men's rejection of a wife inflicted by breast cancer, their own perceptions of diminished femininity due to mastectomy and their own concerns about protecting the family from the hereditary risk of breast cancer. The third theme was seen in men's perception of breast cancer as an inevitable act of God that is far away from one's own family, in associating breast cancer with improper behaviour and in their readiness to face the culture of Eib (shame). answer: Jordanian men perceive themselves as having a vital role in supporting, guiding and encouraging their wives to follow breast cancer early detection recommendations. Breast health awareness campaigns could involve husbands to capitalize on family support.	maybe
question: Can the Internet be used to improve sexual health awareness in web-wise young people? context: To assess Internet use amongst young people to determine whether it would be a practical way to provide sex education and information. Year 10 students (aged 14-15 years) from North Nottinghamshire schools were asked to participate in focus groups to discuss the Internet. A series of predefined questions were directed to the whole group to generate debate. Areas explored included: Internet access and site; frequency and purpose of Internet use; websites visited; ideas for a genitourinary medicine (GUM) website. Responses were recorded by a hand count or as individual verbal responses. Thirteen focus groups were held involving 287 students of approximately equal sex distribution. All had access to Internet facilities at school and 224 (78.0%) had access elsewhere. Access was at least once a week by 178 (62.0%) mostly for e-mail, games, chatlines and homework. No one accessed for health information. One hundred and seventy-nine (62.4%) participants said they would use a GUM website. A 'question line' where they could e-mail questions to a health care professional was of interest to 202 (70.4%) participants. answer: The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.	maybe
