    "title": "Nadroparin calcium. A review of its pharmacology and clinical use in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders.",
    "abstract": "Nadroparin (nadroparin calcium) is a low molecular weight heparin with a mean molecular weight of 4.5 kD. Compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH), nadroparin has a greater ratio of anti-factor Xa to anti-factor Ha activity, greater bioavailability and a longer duration of action, allowing it to be administered by subcutaneous injection for prophylaxis or treatment of thromboembolic disorders. In clinical trials conducted in older patients (mean age usually &gt; 60 years), nadroparin was at least as effective as UFH in preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism after major general or orthopaedic surgery, and in bedridden medical patients. Nadroparin was also at least as effective as dalteparin or oral acenocoumarol in preventing thromboembolic events following general and orthopaedic surgery, respectively. When used for treatment of established DVT, nadroparin was at least as effective as intravenous UFH. Subcutaneous nadroparin, at dosages similar to those used for the treatment of DVT, produced promising results in older patients with pulmonary embolism, acute ischaemic stroke or unstable angina. In 1 study, 75% of nadroparin-treated patients were able to complete their treatment at home and 36% did not require admission to hospital; the potential pharmacoeconomic implications of these results deserve further evaluation. Overall treatment costs (drug acquisition and monitoring costs) were similar for nadroparin and UFH in a French study, but nadroparin was associated with significantly less nursing time spent on treatment delivery. Nadroparin is well tolerated by older patients. The most frequently reported adverse events in a large (n approximately 4500) placebo-controlled study in general surgical patients were wound and injection site haematoma (11.8 and 10.2%, respectively, vs approximately 6.5% for placebo). When used as prophylaxis, no significant differences in bleeding complications were noted between nadroparin and UFH or acenocoumarol recipients. Prophylactic nadroparin was associated with significantly fewer withdrawals because of adverse events than UFH in elderly bedridden medical patients. When used as treatment for DVT, nadroparin was generally associated with lower occurrences of major bleeding than intravenous UFH (0.5 to 2.3% vs 2 to 5%); however, trials were not large enough to demonstrate any significant differences between the 2 agents. Similarly, the incidence of thrombocytopenia was slightly, but generally not significantly, lower in nadroparin (&lt; 1%) than in UFH (&lt; or = 3.5%) recipients. Thus, nadroparin should be considered an effective and well tolerated alternative to UFH for prophylaxis and treatment of DVT in older patients, with the advantage of more convenient administration and decreased monitoring requirements.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major problem in patients with hematological malignancies. Although drug-resistance is known to be induced by the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by the MDR-1 gene, little is known about the mechanisms regulating this gene. Herein, we studied the DNA methylation patterns at the enhancer and repressor binding sites of the MDR-1 gene using the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 and its multidrug resistant derivative K562/ADM (adriamycin). Direct DNA sequence analysis demonstrated methylation to be present at the repressor site (minus 110 GC-box) of the MDR-1 gene in K562/ADM cells, but not in parental K562 cells. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis yielded similar results. Treatment of K562/ADM cells with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine; DAC), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, caused demethylation of the repressor binding site of MDR-1 gene, as assessed by MSP, and also decreased P-gp expression, as assessed by flow cytometric and Northern blot analysis. Although it is generally accepted that DAC upregulates gene expression by demethylating the activator binding sites, our present results suggest that DAC induces down-regulation of P-gp expression as a result of demethylation at the repressor binding site in K562/ADM cells. In this regard, methylation-dependent regulation of the MDR-1 gene in K562/ADM cells is unique.",

    "title": "Clinical pharmacokinetics of ranolazine.",
    "abstract": "Ranolazine is a compound that is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of chronic angina pectoris in combination with amlodipine, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists or nitrates, in patients who have not achieved an adequate response with other anti-anginals. The anti-anginal effect of ranolazine does not depend on changes in heart rate or blood pressure. It acts through different pharmacological mechanisms where inhibition of the late inward sodium current (reducing calcium overload and thereby left ventricular diastolic tension) is one plausible mechanism of reduced oxygen consumption. Initial studies used an oral solution or an immediate-release (IR) capsule, but subsequently an extended-release (ER) formulation was developed to allow for twice-daily administration with maintained efficacy. Following administration of an oral solution or IR capsule, peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) are observed within 1 hour. After administration of radiolabelled ranolazine, 73% of the dose was excreted in urine, and unchanged ranolazine accounted for &lt;5% of radioactivity in both urine and faeces. The absolute bioavailability ranges from 35% to 50%. Food has no effect on rate or extent of absorption from the ER formulation. Ranolazine protein binding is about 61-64% over the therapeutic concentration range. Volume of distribution at steady state ranges from 85 to 180 L. Ranolazine is extensively metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzymes and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6, with approximately 5% excreted renally unchanged. Elimination half-life of ranolazine is 1.4-1.9 hours but is apparently prolonged, on average, to 7 hours for the ER formulation as a result of extended absorption (flip-flop kinetics). Elimination occurs through parallel linear and saturable elimination pathways, where the saturable pathway is related to CYP2D6, which is partly inhibited by ranolazine. Oral plasma clearance diminishes with dose from, on average, 45 L/h at 500 mg twice daily to 33 L/h at 1000 mg twice daily. The departure from dose proportionality for this dose range is modest, with increases in steady-state C(max) and area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 12 hours of 2.5- and 2.7-fold, respectively. Ranolazine pharmacokinetics are unaffected by sex, congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus. AUC increases up to 2-fold with advancing degree of renal impairment. Ranolazine is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A, and increases AUC and C(max) for simvastatin, its metabolites and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor activity &lt;2-fold. Digoxin AUC is increased 40-60% by ranolazine through P-glycoprotein inhibition. Ranolazine AUC is increased by CYP3A inhibitors ranging from 1.5-fold for diltiazem 180 mg once daily to 3.9-fold for ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily. Verapamil increases ranolazine exposure approximately 2-fold. CYP2D6 inhibition has a negligible effect on ranolazine exposure.",

    "title": "Synergistic interactions of the anti-casein kinase 2 CIGB-300 peptide and chemotherapeutic agents in lung and cervical preclinical cancer models.",
    "abstract": "CIGB-300 is a novel clinical-stage synthetic peptide that impairs the casein kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of B23/nucleophosmin in different experimental settings and cancer models. As a single agent, CIGB-300 induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and modulates an array of proteins that are mainly involved in drug resistance, cell proliferation and apoptosis, as determined by proteomic analysis. However, the clinical oncology practice and cumulative knowledge on tumor biology suggest that drug combinations are more likely to cope with tumor complexity compared to single agents. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative effect of CIGB-300 when combined with different anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin (alkylating), paclitaxel (antimitotic), doxorubicin (antitopoisomerase II) or 5-fluorouracil (DNA/RNA antimetabolite) in cell lines derived from lung and cervical cancer. Of note, using a Latin square design and subsequent analysis by CalcuSyn software, we observed that paclitaxel and cisplatin exhibited the best synergistic/additive profile when combined with CIGB-300, according to the combination and dose reduction indices. Such therapeutically favorable profiles may be explained by a direct cytotoxic effect and also by the observed cell cycle impairment following incubation of tumor cells with selected drug combinations. Importantly, on in vivo dose-finding schedules in human cervical tumors xenografted in nude mice, we observed that concomitant administration of CIGB-300 and cisplatin increased mice survival compared to single-agent treatment. Collectively, these findings provide a rationale for combining the anti-CK2 CIGB-300 peptide with currently available anticancer agents in the clinical setting and indicate platins and taxanes as compounds with major perspectives.",

This group of medications comprises diverse mechanisms of action resulting in both shared and unique adverse effects. Areas covered: The major trials and safety profiles of natalizumab, alemtuzumab, daclizumab, rituximab, and ocrelizumab are discussed. While each drug has a unique safety profile, one of the potential safety concerns for all of these drugs is infection, including for some progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Other potential side effects and required monitoring for each drug are addressed. Expert opinion: The treatment of multiple sclerosis is a balance between efficacy and safety. As a group, these medications are highly effective, but not without notable safety concerns; therefore more research is needed to understand the place these medications hold in the overall treatment algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The options for migraine treatment have increased in the recent years and will expand in the near future. In this work both recent and future options for migraine treatment are critically reviewed. Firstly the late advances in the symptomatic treatment of migraine, including the new 5-HT1B/D agonists \"triptans\" appeared after sumatriptan, are reviewed. Possible alternative, such as selective 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F agonists, are also discussed. In the second part of this manuscript the new, possible options for the preventive treatment of migraine comprising \"antiepileptics\", such as valproic acid, gabapentin and topiramate, calcium-antagonists, such as cyclandelate and dotarizin, and a miscellany, including riboflavin, are analysed. Finally, possible compounds for the future, such as the selective inhibitors of neurokinin receptors or drugs acting upon neuronal calcium channels, are commented. From this review we conclude that while there have been relevant advances in the symptomatic treatment of migraine, there is a need for the development of better preventive compounds.",

Because of their predictable dose-response, which eliminates the need for routine laboratory monitoring, they may be more convenient for patients requiring long-term therapy, and have the potential to improve the quality of anticoagulation. The results from 2 large trials of dabigatran (a thrombin inhibitor) compared to warfarin, in patients with atrial fibrillation and those with acute symptomatic venous thromboembolism, have recently become available. These trials provide convincing evidence of the efficacy of dabigatran in preventing patient-important clinical outcomes when compared to warfarin.

    "abstract": "A series of bis(phenylalkyl)amines, structural analogues of ifenprodil and nylidrin, were synthesized and tested for antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Potency and subunit selectivity were assayed by electrical recordings in Xenopus oocytes expressing three binary combinations of cloned rat NMDA receptor subunits: NR1A expressed in combination with either NR2A, NR2B, or NR2C. The bis(phenylalkyl)amines were selective antagonists of NR1A/2B receptors. Assayed under steady-state conditions, the most potent of these, N-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-5-phenylpentylamine hydrochloride (20), has an IC50 value of 8 nM and &gt;1000-fold selectivity with respect to NR1A/2A and NR1A/2C receptors. The structure-activity relationship of the bis(phenylalkyl)amine series indicates that the piperidine ring and alkyl chain substitutions common to NR2B-selective antagonists such as ifenprodil, CP 101,606, and Ro 25-6981 are not necessary to generate potent and selective ligands. The primary determinants of potency are the phenolic OH group, acting as a hydrogen bond donor, the distance between the two rings, and an electrostatic interaction between the receptor and the basic nitrogen atom. This study provides a framework for designing structurally novel NR2B-selective antagonists which may be useful for treatment of a variety of neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conditions requiring inhibition of acid secretion, such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), peptic ulcers, non-ulcer dyspepsia or the use of NSAIDs, are very common, and their prevalence is expecting to rise as they are seen predominantly amongst the elderly. Among the drugs available to inhibit acid secretion, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have been shown to have the best efficacy-safety ratio and have been used widely. OBJECTIVE: This paper was intended to provide an overall presentation of one of these PPIs, pantoprazole. METHOD: This study was first intended to give an overview of pantoprazole, so a Medline search was conducted using pantoprazole as unique search term, without publication date restriction. We found 826 references for pantoprazole and selected some of the most relevant publications to conduct this review. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Five different PPIs are commercially available: omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, lansoprazole and esomeprazole. Pantoprazole differs from other PPIs by a selective binding to the ion transport pathway, a good stability at neutral pH values, and a relatively robust plasma concentration-time curve. These pharmacokinetic differences may not be fully converted into pharmacodynamic differences of pantoprazole versus other PPIs. Pantoprazole has been assessed in most of the clinical situations where acid suppression is required, and showed great efficacy and an excellent safety profile. Some safety concerns were raised with long-term use of PPIs, but they are well balanced by the benefit of PPIs for patients with conditions such as GORD or peptic ulcer.",

    "abstract": "3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole derivative (BTP2) or N-[4-3, 5-bis(trifluromethyl)pyrazol-1-yl]-4-methyl-1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-carboxamide (YM-58483) is an immunosuppressive compound that potently inhibits both Ca2+ influx and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in lymphocytes. We report here that BTP2 dosedependently enhances transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4), a Ca2+-activated nonselective (CAN) cation channel that decreases Ca2+ influx by depolarizing lymphocytes. The effect of BTP2 on TRPM4 occurs at low nanomolar concentrations and is highly specific, because other ion channels in T lymphocytes are not significantly affected, and the major Ca2+ influx pathway in lymphocytes, ICRAC, is blocked only at 100-fold higher concentrations. The efficacy of BTP2 in blocking IL-2 production is reduced approximately 100-fold when preventing TRPM4-mediated membrane depolarization, suggesting that the BTP2-mediated facilitation of TRPM4 channels represents the major mechanism for its immunosuppressive effect. Our results demonstrate that TRPM4 channels represent a previously unrecognized key element in lymphocyte Ca2+ signaling and that their facilitation by BTP2 supports cell membrane depolarization, which reduces the driving force for Ca2+ entry and ultimately causes the potent suppression of cytokine release.",

Luciferase assay in HT-29 cells, which strongly express PPAR gamma, showed that troglitazone, a selective ligand for PPAR gamma, transactivated the transcription of a peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE)-driven promoter. Furthermore, troglitazone caused a marked decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation and G1 cell-cycle arrest determined by flow cytometry. Finally, troglitazone induced expression of mRNAs for villin and intestinal alkaline phosphatase, markers for enterocyte differentiation.

    "title": "Reassessment of the rationale for the combinations of sulphonamides with diaminopyrimidines.",
    "abstract": "Trimethoprim is the best known inhibitor of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase. Initially, this was always combined with sulphamethoxazole. It was later combined with other sulphonamides (eg. sulphamoxole, sulphadiazine or sulfametopyrazine), but the sulphonamide moiety as a contributor to clinical efficacy was increasingly questioned. Thus, in 1979 (in UK) trimethoprim alone was introduced. Justification for the combination was based on: (a) synergy occurs in vitro (b) bactericidal activity, while the two components are bacteriostatic (c) the emergence of resistance was claimed to be lower. However, these claims were not substantiated by studying the microbiological and pharmacokinetic properties of trimethoprim and the sulphonamides, but most importantly by the results of clinical trials. These show that in most indications, trimethoprim alone is as good, cheaper and causes considerably fewer adverse events than use with a sulphonamide. For urinary infections most agree that monotherapy is best. In respiratory infections diaminopyrimidines have relatively poor activity against important pathogens, eg pneumococci and especially Moraxella catarrhalis. It could be argued in these case that the addition of a sulphonamide may increase therapeutic efficacy. This can only be resolved by large clinical trials. In brucellosis and gonorrhoea, where sulphonamides are more microbiologically active than diaminopyrimidines, it is likely that combination with another antibiotic is needed. However, too much reliance must not be placed on extrapolating from trimethoprim to other diaminopyrimidines; conclusions should be drawn from work using the other compounds.",

    "abstract": "A number of novel cyclic amidine analogs of chlorambucil were synthesized and examined for cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell cultures and for inhibition of topoisomerases I and II. Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of these compounds employing a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and inhibition of [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells demonstrated that these compounds were more active than chlorambucil. The degree to which these compounds inhibited cell growth breast cancer cells was directly correlated to DNA-binding affinity. These studies indicate that cyclic amidine analogs of chlorambucil are a potent catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase II but not topoisomerase I. The highest degree of DNA binding and cytotoxicity in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells was observed for the compound, which possess a 4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol moiety.",

    "title": "Riluzole normalizes early-life stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity in rats: role of spinal glutamate reuptake mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The molecular basis underlying visceral hypersensitivity in functional irritable bowel syndrome remains elusive, resulting in poor treatment effectiveness. Because alterations in spinal non-neuronal (astrocytic) glutamate reuptake are suspected to participate in chronic pain, we asked whether such processes occur in visceral hypersensitivity. METHODS: Visceral hypersensitivity was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by maternal separation. Separated adults were given a systemic administration of riluzole (5 mg/kg), an approved neuroprotective agent activating glutamate reuptake. Visceral hypersensitivity was assessed using colorectal distension (40 mm Hg). Somatic nociception was quantified using Hot Plate, Randall-Sellito, and Hargreaves tests. Spinal proteins were quantified using immunofluorescence and Western blot. The dependence of visceral sensory function upon spinal glutamate transport was evaluated by intrathecal injection of glutamate transport antagonist DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA). For in vitro testing of riluzole and TBOA, primary cultures of astrocytes were used. RESULTS: We show that riluzole counteracts stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity without affecting visceral response in nonseparated rats or altering nociceptive responses to somatic pain stimulation. In addition, maternal separation produces a reduction in glial excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT)-1 with no change in EAAT-2 or gamma-amino butyric acid transporters. Stress was not associated with changes in glial fibrillary acidic protein or astrocytic morphology per se. Furthermore, visceral normosensitivity relies on spinal EAAT, as intrathecal TBOA is sufficient to induce hypersensitivity in normal rats. CONCLUSIONS: We identify spinal EAAT as a therapeutic target, and establish riluzole as a candidate to counteract gastrointestinal hypersensitivity in disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The polyhydroxy alkaloid glycosidase inhibitors swainsonine [1] and calystegine B2 [6] have been identified as constituents of the seeds of the Australian plant Ipomoea sp. Q6 [aff. calobra] (Weir vine) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and by their biological activity as inhibitors of specific glycosidases. This plant, which is known only from a small area of southern Queensland, has been reported to produce a neurological disorder when consumed by livestock. The extract of the seeds showed inhibition of alpha-mannosidase, beta-glucosidase, and alpha-galactosidase, consistent with the presence of 1 and alkaloids of the calystegine class. Histological examination of brain tissue from field cases of sheep and cattle poisoned by Weir vine showed lesions similar to those observed in animals poisoned by the swainsonine-containing poison peas (Swainsona spp.) of Australia and locoweeds (Astragalus and Oxytropis spp.) of North America. These results indicate that Weir vine poisoning is an additional manifestation of the induced lysosomal storage disease, mannosidosis, possibly exacerbated by inhibition of the enzymes beta-glucosidase and alpha-galactosidase by calystegine B2. This is the first reported example of a single plant species capable of producing structurally distinct glycosidase inhibitors, namely, alkaloids of the indolizidine and nortropane classes.",

    "abstract": "The present study used nerve terminals (synaptosomes) isolated from rat cerebral cortex to investigate the relationship between caffeine and 4-aminopyridine (4AP)-evoked endogenous excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate release. Micromolar concentrations of caffeine facilitated 4AP, but not KCl or ionomycin-evoked glutamate release from synaptosomes. This release facilitation resulted from an enhancement of vesicular and nonvesicular release and associated with an increase both in 4AP-evoked depolarization of the synaptosomal plasma membrane potential and in 4AP-evoked increase in the cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](C)). In addition, the release facilitation by caffeine was significantly reduced in synaptosomes pretreated with a wide spectrum blocker of N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels, omega-conotoxin MVIIC. Furthermore, protein kinase C (PKC) activator and inhibitor, respectively, superseding or suppressing the caffeine-mediated facilitation of glutamate release. These results concluded that caffeine exerts their presynaptic facilitatory effect, likely through the activation of PKC pathway, which subsequently enhances terminal excitability and Ca(2+) entry to cause an increase in evoked glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical nerve terminals. Additionally, this release facilitation may involve an interaction of caffeine with presynaptic adenosine A1 receptors as adenosine A1 receptor inhibition abolished the caffeine-mediated facilitation of evoked glutamate release.",

    "abstract": "Although carbetapentane produces skin (peripheral) infiltrative analgesia, the underlying mechanism of carbetapentane in local anesthesia is not well understood. The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of carbetapentane on voltage-gated Na(+) channels and its efficacy on spinal (central) anesthesia. We evaluated the effects of carbetapentane on rat motor and pain behavior (when administered intrathecally) and on voltage-gated sodium channels in differentiated neuronal NG108-15 cells. Carbetapentane exhibited dose-dependent spinal blockade with a more sensory-selective action over motor blockade (P&lt;0.05). Carbetapentane was more potent than lidocaine (P&lt;0.05) in spinal anesthesia. Intrathecal 5% dextrose (vehicle) elicited no spinal anesthesia. Lidocaine, used as a positive control, demonstrated concentration- and state-dependent effects on tonic block of voltage-gated Na(+) currents (IC50 of 49.6 and 194.6 microM at holding potentials of -70 and -100 mV, respectively). Carbetapentane was more potent (IC50 of 36.3 and 62.2 microM at holding potentials of -70 and -100 mV, respectively). Carbetapentane showed a much stronger frequency-dependence of block than lidocaine: with high frequency stimulation (3.33 Hz), 50 microM lidocaine produced an additional 30% blockade, while the same concentration of carbetapentane produced 70% more block. These results revealed carbetapentane had a more potent and prolonged spinal blockade with a more sensory/nociceptive-selective action over motor blockade in comparison with lidocaine. Spinal anesthesia with carbetapentane could be through inhibition of voltage-gated Na(+) currents.",

    "abstract": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonists have potential in treating numerous hormone-dependent pathologies including cancers of the prostate, breast, and ovary, endometriosis, and fertility disorders. An unmet clinical need exists for an orally available GnRH receptor antagonist. Guided by structure-activity relationships, ligand-based targeted library designs, and biomarker measurements, our discovery efforts have yielded a novel, small molecule GnRH receptor antagonist, 5-[(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthalenyl)methyl]-N-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-furamide (CMPD1). CMPD1 bound with low nanomolar affinities to human, rat, and mouse GnRH receptors (6.0, 3.8, and 2.2 nM, respectively). CMPD1 was more than 100-fold selective for GnRH receptors versus various G-protein-coupled receptors and other enzymes and ion channels. In cells expressing recombinant rat GnRH receptors, CMPD1 was a competitive antagonist of GnRH-stimulated increases in extracellular acidification rates in Cytosensor microphysiometer assays. In cells expressing recombinant human GnRH receptors, CMPD1 was a potent inhibitor of GnRH-stimulated total inositol phosphate accumulation. The effects of CMPD1 on circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone were studied in castrated and intact male rats, respectively. Intravenous and oral administration of CMPD1 dose dependently suppressed GnRH-mediated elevations of LH in castrated male rats and testosterone in gonad-intact male rats. Moreover, CMPD1, when given at 20 mg/kg i.v. to intact male rats, inhibited the elevations of LH and testosterone stimulated by the superagonist of GnRH, [d-Ala(6), des-Gly(10)]GnRH (GnRH-A). These data suggest that CMPD1 is a potent, selective, orally active GnRH receptor antagonist that may have potential application as a therapeutic agent for treating hormone-dependent cancers and diseases.",

Bacterial isolates included: Pseudomonas aeruginosa harbouring PER-1 beta-lactamase (n=14); Acinetobacter baumannii harbouring PER-1, OXA-51 and OXA-58 (n=20); carbapenem-non-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and Escherichia coli (n=1) harbouring OXA-48; carbapenem-non-susceptible E. coli (n=1) harbouring both IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL); carbapenem-non-susceptible Serratia marcescens (n=1); and carbapenem-susceptible E. coli (n=20) and K. pneumoniae isolates (n=12) with CTX-M-15 ESBL. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime were determined in combination with 4 mg/L avibactam by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) method on Mueller-Hinton agar. Imipenem/avibactam and ceftazidime/avibactam displayed limited potency against A. baumannii isolates, whereas cefepime/avibactam and ceftazidime/avibactam were active against P. aeruginosa. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with OXA-48 beta-lactamase were resistant to imipenem [MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) &gt;=4 mg/L]. MIC(90) values for the combination of avibactam 4 mg/L with imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime were in the susceptible range for all strains (MIC(90)&lt;=0.5mg/L). All E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates with CTX-M-15 beta-lactamase were inhibited at &lt;=1 mg/L for combinations with avibactam and 100% were susceptible by CLSI breakpoint criteria to imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime. In conclusion, combinations of imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime with avibactam may present a promising therapeutic strategy to treat infections due to K. pneumoniae with OXA-48 enzyme as well as K. pneumoniae and E. coli with CTX-M-15 enzyme.",

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The effect of various PUFAS on PPARgamma1 and -gamma2 mRNA expression was investigated in freshly isolated adipocytes prepared from fat samples obtained during surgery. PPARgamma mRNA levels were also determined in subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies of 11 obese women, in the fasting state, to search for in vivo associations between PPARgamma expression and plasma PUFA concentrations. PPARgamma mRNA levels were determined by reverse-transcription competitive polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly increased PPARgamma1 mRNA levels in isolated adipocytes, without affecting the expression of PPARgamma2. The other tested fatty acids (linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and omega-6 PUFAs) had no effect. The effect of EPA was dependent on the concentration (maximal effect after 6 hours with 50 microM) and was not reproduced by activators of the different members of the PPAR family. In addition, a strong positive correlation was found between plasma EPA concentrations and PPARgamma mRNA levels in adipose tissue of obese subjects. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate that adipose tissue PPARgamma1 mRNA concentration is positively regulated by EPA, suggesting that the composition of dietary lipids may affect PPARgamma gene expression in vivo in humans. These data also suggest that an induction of the expression of this nuclear receptor isoform might be involved in the mechanism of action of EPA and in some of its beneficial effects.",

We have determined the structure of PEIII crystallized in the presence of NAD to define the site of binding and mechanism of activation. However, NAD undergoes a slow hydrolysis and the crystal structure revealed only the hydrolysis products, AMP and nicotinamide, bound to the enzyme. To better define the site of NAD binding, we have now crystallized PEIII in the presence of a less hydrolyzable NAD analog, beta-methylene-thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (beta-TAD), and refined the complex structure at 2.3 angstroms resolution. There are two independent molecules of PEIII in the crystal, and the conformations of beta-TAD show some differences in the two binding sites. The beta-TAD attached to molecule 2 appears to have been hydrolyzed between the pyrophosphate and the nicotinamide ribose. However molecule 1 binds to an intact beta-TAD and has no crystal packing contacts in the vicinity of the binding site, so that the observed conformation and interaction with the PEIII most likely resembles that of NAD bound to PEIII in solution. We have compared this complex with the catalytic domains of diphtheria toxin, heat labile enterotoxin, and pertussis toxin, all three of which it closely resembles.",

    "abstract": "Since activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) was discovered in 1988, considerable interest has developed in the biological role of this enzyme, particularly in hemostasis and thrombotic diseases. Given the large number of publications about the underpinning biology of fibrinolysis, the relatively small number of reported chemical tools or drug-like molecules that target this mechanism is surprising. In the context of drug design, most of the disclosed fibrinolysis inhibitors occupy less-exploited regions of drug-like space. To generalize, most of these molecules are either small and hydrophilic, or are larger carboxylic acids. The chemical nature of these inhibitors reflects those of the endogenous substrate for this zinc metalloprotease enzyme target. Knowledge of the target has defined the way medicinal chemists have designed inhibitors to target this enzyme of intriguing therapeutic potential. This review summarizes the publications, patent literature and company disclosures on small-molecule inhibitors of TAFIa from 2006 to the present.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the structural differences, local anesthetics, anticonvulsants, and tricyclic antidepressants exert similar use-dependent actions against voltage-gated Na channels, which may be contributory to pain control. The authors explore whether these drugs could doubly occupy the channel and exert synergic clinical effect. METHODS: The authors performed electrophysiologic recordings and quantitative analyses in mutant and native neuronal Na channels to investigate molecular interactions between different drugs. RESULTS: The authors demonstrate significant interactions between F1764 and W1716, two residues reported for local anesthetic binding, indicating uncertainties to conclude a common drug-binding site by mutation data. Therefore, the authors performed detailed functional studies in native neurons. Quantitative analyses of the inactivation curve shift argue against effective double occupancy of different drugs. For example, the shift of 20.9 +/- 1.3 mV in the simultaneous presence of 10 microm imipramine, 100 microm lidocaine, and 100 microm phenytoin is consistent with the one-site (21.5 mV) rather than the two-site (30.5-33.8 mV) or three-site (42.7 mV) predictions. However, there is a deviation from the recovery courses predicted by one site if lidocaine or imipramine coexists with anticonvulsants. Moreover, gating state dependence of macroscopic-binding rates markedly differs between imipramine and carbamazepine. CONCLUSIONS: Carbamazepine, lidocaine, and imipramine bind to a common site with the common aromatic motif. External to the aromatic site, there is another weaker and less gating-dependent site for the tertiary amine chain in the latter two drugs. Concomitant clinical use of these drugs, thus, should have at most a simple additive but not a synergistic inhibitory action on Na currents.",

Both ATC0065 and ATC0175 had high affinities for human MCHR1 with IC(50) values of 15.7 +/- 1.95 and 7.23 +/- 0.59 nM, respectively. Both ATC0065 (IC(50) = 21.4 +/- 1.57 nM) and ATC0175 (IC(50) = 13.5 +/- 0.78 nM) showed potent antagonist activities at MCHR1, as assessed by MCH-increased guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)phosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding to human MCHR1. Oral administration of ATC0065 (3-30 mg/kg) or ATC0175 (1-10 mg/kg) significantly reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test in rats, indicating antidepressant-like effects. Both ATC0065 and ATC0175 significantly reversed swim stress-induced anxiety in the elevated plus-maze test in rats and stress-induced hyperthermia in mice. ATC0175 significantly increased social interaction between unfamiliar rats and reduced separation-induced vocalizations in guinea pig pups, indicating anxiolytic potential. In contrast, ATC0065 and ATC0175 did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity or rotarod performance in rats. These findings indicate that ATC0065 and ATC0175 are potent and orally active MCHR1 antagonists with anxiolytic and antidepressant activity in rodents.",

Dantrolene is the only available drug for effective and specific MH therapy, which reduces significantly the mortality rate. Dantrolene is a skeletal muscle relaxant that depresses the excitation-contraction coupling,however, the specificity of action remains unknown. Recent studies identified the ryanodine receptor, the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as the direct molecular target of dantrolene. In addition to its use for MH, dantrolene is used in other disorders such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and spasticity. Since dantrolene is weakly water soluble, the clinical preparation is time and manpower consuming. New agents have been synthesized, but because of economic considerations no registration for clinical usage has been realised.",

Lisuride or 0.9% NaCl was administered subcutaneously 30 min before induction of cerebral infarction. Lisuride (0.01 mg/kg) not only prolonged the survival time of the animals but also suppressed cerebral edema, increase in the electrolytes content and histological damage in the brain.

    "abstract": "The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) has been under investigation for several years as a pharmaceutical drug target. Clinical studies have shown that fusion proteins consisting of human recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO) and the Fc-part of IgG can be transported after pulmonary administration via FcRn across the airway epithelium to the blood stream. So far, no clinically approved pharmaceutical formulation of EPO-Fc is available. Since various forms of recombinant erythropoietins have been frequently misused by athletes as performance-enhancing agents, EPO-Fc might play a similar role in sports in the future. In order to investigate the detectability of EPO-Fc in human blood, different strategies were tested and developed. Only two of them fulfilled the necessary requirements regarding sensitivity and specificity. A rapid protocol useful for screening purposes first enriches EPO-Fc from human serum via high capacity protein A beads and subsequently detects EPO-Fc in the eluate with a commercial EPO ELISA kit. The limit of detection (LOD) of the method is about 5 pg (45 amol) EPO-Fc and is independent of the serum volume used. For screening and/or confirmation purposes a second protocol was evaluated, which consists of a fast EPO immunopurification step followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate or sarcosyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, SAR-PAGE) and Western double-blotting with chemiluminescence detection - a method already established in routine EPO anti-doping control. The latter strategy allows the detection of EPO-Fc in serum together with all other recombinant erythropoietins and with an identical LOD (5 pg/45 amol) as for the rapid screening protocol.",

    "title": "The crystal structure of the BMP-2:BMPR-IA complex and the generation of BMP-2 antagonists.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. Signaling of the BMPs requires the binding of the BMP to the BMP cell surface receptors BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, and BMPR-II. Similar to other cytokines, members of the TGF-beta superfamily exhibit stringent specificity in their ligand-receptor interactions, which may be a reason for the qualitative and quantitative differences in cellular responses. To understand how BMPs and GDFs activate their receptors, it is important to determine structure and binding mechanisms of ligand-receptor complexes. We have used BMP-2 as a key representative of the BMPs to identify the epitopes for type I and type II receptor binding by mutational interaction analyses and have solved the crystal structure of a BMP2:BMPR-IA receptor ectodomain complex. METHODS: To identify amino acid side chains involved in receptor binding, a collection of in vitro mutagenized human BMP-2 variants was prepared and subjected to interaction analyses with use of the receptor ectodomains of BMPR-IA, BMPR-II, and ActR-II immobilized on a biosensor system. The biological activity of the BMP-2 variants was measured by BMP-2 dependent expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in C2C12 cells. For crystallization, a complex of BMP-2 and the ectodomain of BMPR-IA was formed in solution, purified, and crystallized as described(12). RESULTS: The ligand-receptor interaction analysis of the BMP-2 variants identified distinct epitopes for type I and type II receptor binding. Because the structure of TGF-beta-like proteins has been compared with that of an open hand, the binding epitope for the type I receptor was-on the basis of its location-termed \"wrist\" epitope. The crystal structure of the BMP-2:BMPR-IA ectodomain complex revealed a key feature of the ligand-receptor interaction: a large hydrophobic residue (Phe85) within a hydrophobic patch of BMPR-IA fit into a hydrophobic pocket composed of residues of both BMP-2 monomers. A second epitope identified by alanine mutagenesis scanning was termed the \"knuckle\" epitope on the basis of its location on the outer side of the \"finger\" segments of BMP-2. Mutations in either the wrist epitope or the knuckle epitope produced variants with altered biological activities. Variants with antagonistic properties were exclusively generated by mutations in the knuckle epitope of BMP-2. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The identification and characterization of the two receptor binding epitopes in BMP-2 provide new insight into the primary steps of BMP-receptor activation. Because of the structural similarities between members of the TGF-beta superfamily, it can be assumed that the data presented in this work are transferable to other TGF-beta receptor systems. Because of the association with various diseases, the generation of antagonists of other TGF-beta superfamily members might generate potent tools for basic research and therapeutic approaches.",

    "title": "Role of cyclic GMP and calcineurin in homologous and heterologous desensitization of natriuretic peptide receptor-A.",
    "abstract": "The natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) mediates natriuretic, hypotensive, and antihypertrophic effects of natriuretic peptides through the production of cGMP. In pathological conditions such as heart failure, these effects are attenuated by homologous and heterologous desensitization mechanisms resulting in the dephosphorylation of the cytosolic portion of the receptor. In contrast with natriuretic peptide-induced desensitization, pressor hormone-induced desensitization is dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) stimulation and (or) cytosolic calcium elevation. Mechanisms by which PKC and Ca(2+) promote NPR-A desensitization are not known. The role of cGMP and of the cytosolic Ca(2+) pathways in NPR-A desensitization were therefore studied. In contrast with the activation of NPR-A by its agonist, activation of soluble guanylyl cyclases of LLC-PK1 cells by sodium nitroprusside also leads to a production of cGMP but without altering NPR-A activation. Consequently, cGMP elevation per se does not appear to mediate homologous desensitization of NPR-A. In addition, cytosolic calcium increase is required only for the heterologous desensitization pathway since the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM blocks only PMA or ionomycin-induced desensitization. Calcineurin inhibitors block the NPR-A guanylyl cyclase heterologous desensitization induced by ionomycin, suggesting an essential role for this Ca(2+)-stimulated phosphatase in NPR-A desensitization. In summary, the present report demonstrates that neither cGMP nor Ca(2+) cytosolic elevation cause NPR-A homologous desensitization. Our results also indicate for the first time a role for calcineurin in NPR-A heterologous desensitization.",

    "abstract": "While trying to identify new members of the somatostatin receptor family of G protein-coupled receptors, we isolated cDNAs from a mouse brain library encoding two related receptor-like proteins, designated msl-1 and msl-2, of 380 and 372 amino acids, respectively. There was 61% identity and 71% similarity between the sequences of msl-1 and msl-2. Among members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, the sequences of both msl-1 and msl-1 were most closely related to those of the somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), having approximately 35% identity with the sequence of SSTR1. Transient expression in COS-1 cells showed that msl-1 and msl-2 did not bind somatostatin. Rather they bound opioids selectively and with high affinity and had the pharmacological properties of kappa and delta opioid receptors, respectively. Indeed, the sequence of msl-2 was identical to that of a delta opioid receptor recently cloned by other workers. Functional characterization of kappa/msl-1 and delta/msl-2 opioid receptors showed that they were coupled to G proteins and mediated opioid receptor class-specific agonist inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation. RNA blotting studies and in situ hybridization histochemistry showed that kappa opioid receptor mRNA was expressed at high levels in brain in the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, medial habenula, hypothalamus (arcuate and paraventricular nuclei), locus ceruleus, and parabrachial nucleus, suggesting that this receptor may play a role in arousal and regulation of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Near-infrared dye-tagged antibodies can be used for the sensitive detection of tumor tissue in vivo. Surgery for clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) might benefit from the use of optical imaging to facilitate the intraoperative detection of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)-expressing tumor lesions with chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) girentuximab, which has been shown to have excellent imaging capabilities for ccRCC. Here we studied the potential of fluorescence imaging to detect ccRCC tumors in nude mice with RCC xenografts by using mAb girentuximab conjugated with IRDye800CW; SPECT imaging was used as a reference. METHODS: Groups of athymic BALB/c mice with subcutaneous CAIX-positive SK-RC-52 ccRCC tumors were injected intravenously with (125)I-labeled girentuximab-IRDye800CW or (125)I-labeled girentuximab. For determination of the specificity of the accumulation of the anti-CAIX antibody conjugate in ccRCC, separate groups of mice bearing a CAIX-positive tumor (SK-RC-52) and a CAIX-negative tumor (SK-RC-59) received (125)I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW or (125)I-labeled MOPC21-IRDye800CW (control mAb). Optical images and micro-SPECT images were acquired until 3 d after injection. Mice were euthanized after the last imaging session, and the biodistribution of the radiolabeled antibody preparations was determined. RESULTS: Optical imaging and micro-SPECT imaging at 1 d after the injection of (125)I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW showed clear delineation of the CAIX-expressing ccRCC xenografts, and image contrast improved with time. Fluorescence imaging and biodistribution studies showed high and specific uptake of (125)I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW in CAIX-positive ccRCC xenografts (SK-RC-52, 31.5 +- 9.6 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g] at 72 h after injection). Tumor uptake was specific, as very low uptake of (125)I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW was noted in the CAIX-negative SK-RC-59 tumor (4.1 +- 1.5 %ID/g), and no uptake of (125)I-MOPC21-IRDye800CW (control mAb) was noted in the CAIX-positive SK-RC-52 tumor (1.2 +- 0.1 %ID/g). CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous CAIX-expressing ccRCC xenografts were visualized by optical imaging with (125)I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW. Optical images showed good concordance with micro-SPECT images. The accumulation of (125)I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW in ccRCC tumors was high and specific. Girentuximab-IRDye800CW potentially could be used for the intraoperative detection of CAIX-expressing tumors and the assessment of residual tumor in resection margins or metastatic lesions in patients with ccRCC.",

However, the detailed exocytosis mechanisms of monoamine using microdialysis has remained to be clarified. The present report introduces methods for administration of voltage-sensitive calcium channel (VSCC) inhibitors and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) inhibitors to clarify the mechanisms of monoamine exocytosis using in vivo microdialysis. The N-type and P-type VSCCs are inhibited by perfusion with omega-conotoxin GVIA and omega-agatoxin IVA, respectively; however, their diffusion rate from internal to external spaces of the microdialysis probe is lower than 1%. Unlike VSCC inhibitors, SNAP-25, synaptobrevin and syntaxin can be cleavaed with botulinum toxin type A, B and C, respectively. These toxins (with molecular weights over 500,000) bind specifically to the presynaptic membrane via the heavy chain, while the light chain enters the cytosol, where it displays zinc-endopeptidase activity directed to proteins of the neuroexocytosis apparatus. Therefore, to prevent SNARE activity, botulinum toxins are microinjected. These two methods, perfusion with VSCC inhibitors and microinjection with botulinum toxins, can contribute to the clarification of the mechanisms of monoaminergic exocytosis.",

The expressed channels were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques and examined for GTX sensitivity. As a measure of GTX sensitivity, we used relative chord conductance (ratio of maximum chord conductance of noninactivating GTX-modified Na(+) currents to that of unmodified peak currents). Wild-type channels from skeletal muscle (mu 1) were more sensitive to GTX modification than wild-type cardiac channels (rH1) by a factor of 1.6. To facilitate exploration of alpha-subunit sites determining GTX sensitivity, we used SHHH, a chimera of skeletal muscle (S) domain D1 and heart muscle (H) domains D2D3D4 with supernormal sensitivity to GTX I (1.5-fold of wild-type mu 1). Successive replacement of Ser-251 (D1S4-S5 intracellular loop) and Ile-433 (D1S6 transmembrane segment), with corresponding rH1 residues Ala and Val, reduced, in a stepwise manner, the GTX sensitivity of the chimera and related mutants to that of wild-type rHl.

    "title": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 10. Isomeric 4-[(3-bromophenyl)amino]pyrido[d]-pyrimidines are potent ATP binding site inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase function of the epidermal growth factor receptor.",
    "abstract": "Following the discovery of the very high inhibitory ability of the 4-[(3-bromophenyl)amino]-quinazolines against the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (e.g., 3, IC50 0.029 nM), four series of related pyrido[d]pyrimidines bearing electron-donating groups at the 6- or 7-positions have been synthesized and evaluated. The compounds were prepared by nucleophilic substitution of the corresponding 6- and 7-fluoro analogues. While members of all series showed potent inhibitory activity against isolated EGFR, there were important differences between the different isomeric pyrido[d]pyrimidines and the parent quinazolines. Overall, the [3,4-d] and [4,3-d] series were the most potent, followed by the [3,2-d] compounds, with the [2,3-d] analogues being least active. Whereas in the parent quinazoline series the addition of steric bulk to a 6- or 7-NH2 substituent (i.e., NHMe and NMe2 groups) dramatically decreased potency, no such trend was discernable in the [3,2-d] series. Furthermore, in the 7-substituted pyrido[4,3-d]- and 6-substituted pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine series, and to a limited extent in the 7-substituted pyrido[2,3-d] series, such substitution increased potency dramatically, to the extent that the 7-(methylamino)pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine (5f) (IC50 0.13 nM) and 6-(methylamino)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine (7f) (IC50 0.008 nM) constitute important new leads. Selected compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit EGFR autophosphorylation in A431 cells, and a positive quantitative correlation was found between this activity and inhibitory activity against the isolated enzyme.",

    "title": "Clinical effects of raloxifene hydrochloride in women.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To review clinical data on raloxifene hydrochloride, a selective estrogen receptor modulator that was recently approved for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. DATA SOURCES: English-language articles published from 1980 to May 1998 were identified through MEDLINE searches. Bibliographies, book chapters, and meeting abstracts were reviewed for additional relevant publications. STUDY SELECTION: Publications that contained information on the background of development, structure, mechanism of action, tissue-selective effects, and adverse effects of raloxifene hydrochloride were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data in selected articles were reviewed, and relevant clinical information was extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Raloxifene hydrochloride was developed in an effort to find a treatment for breast cancer and osteoporosis. It binds to the estrogen receptor and shows tissue-selective effects; thus, it belongs to a class of drugs recently described as selective estrogen receptor modulators. Tissue selectivity of raloxifene may be achieved through several mechanisms: the ligand structure, interaction of the ligand with different estrogen receptor subtypes in various tissues, and intracellular events after ligand binding. Raloxifene has estrogen-agonistic effects on bone and lipids and estrogen-antagonistic effects on the breast and uterus. An increase in bone mineral density at the spine, total hip, and total body has been reported with raloxifene but seems to be less than that seen with estrogen or alendronate therapy. Raloxifene has been shown to produce a reduction in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations similar to that produced by estrogen therapy, but high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations do not increase during raloxifene therapy. In the uterus, raloxifene does not stimulate the endometrium. Long-term data on the effects of raloxifene in reduction of risk for fracture; prevention of cardiovascular events; cognitive function; and the incidence of breast, ovarian, and uterine cancer are not available. The most common adverse effect of raloxifene is hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: Raloxifene has been shown to have beneficial effects in selected organs in postmenopausal women. Although estrogen remains the drug of choice for hormonal therapy in most postmenopausal women, raloxifene may be an alternative in certain groups of women at risk for osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "1-((R)-5-tert-butyl-indan-1-yl)-3-isoquinolin-5-yl-urea (A-778317) is a novel, stereoselective, competitive antagonist that potently blocks transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptor-mediated changes in intracellular calcium concentrations (pIC50 = 8.31 +/- 0.13). The (S)-stereoisomer, 1-((S)-5-tert-butyl-indan-1-yl)-3-isoquinolin-5-yl-urea (A-778316), is 6.8-fold less potent (pIC50 = 7.47 +/- 0.07). A-778317 also potently blocks capsaicin and acid activation of native rat TRPV1 receptors in dorsal root ganglion neurons. A-778317 was tritiated ([3H]A-778317; 29.3 Ci/mmol) and used to study recombinant human TRPV1 (hTRPV1) receptors expressed in Chinese ovary cells (CHO) cells. [3H]A-778317 labeled a single class of binding sites in hTRPV1-expressing CHO cell membranes with high affinity (KD = 3.4 nM; Bmax = 4.0 pmol/mg protein). Specific binding of 2 nM [3H]A-778317 to hTRPV1-expressing CHO cell membranes was reversible. The rank-order potency of TRPV1 receptor antagonists to inhibit binding of 2 nM [3H]A-778317 correlated well with their functional potencies in blocking TRPV1 receptor activation. The present data demonstrate that A-778317 blocks polymodal activation of the TRPV1 receptor by binding to a single high-affinity binding site and that [3H]A-778317 possesses favorable binding properties to facilitate further studies of hTRPV1 receptor pharmacology.",

Our efforts have been directed towards the development of an efficient synthetic route allowing the facile introduction of substituents on the imidazole ring. In particular, a series of imidazole based compounds bearing the biphenyl moiety at the N - 1 position, a halogen atom at the C-4 and polar substituents such as hydroxymethyl, aldo or carboxy group at the C-2 position were designed and synthesized. These compounds were evaluated for binding to human AT1 receptor and for ANG II antagonism in vitro on isolated rat uterus. Among them, 5-butyl-1-[[2'-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl]imidazole-2-carboxylic acid (30) exhibited higher binding affinity compared to the other analogues tested (-log IC(50) = 8.46). The latter analogue was also found to be the most active in the rat uterotonic test (pA(2) = 7.83). Importantly, the binding affinity was higher to that of losartan (-log IC(50) = 8.25) indicating the importance of carboxy group at the C-2 position. Experimental findings are in good agreement with docking studies, which were undertaken in order to investigate ligand/AT1 receptor interactions.",

    "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic mediator of inflammation that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of devastating clinical syndromes including septic shock. We have investigated the role of a TNF-responsive phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) for the cytotoxic and proinflammatory activity of TNF. We show here that the cytotoxicity signaled for by the so-called \"death domain\" of the p55 TNF receptor is associated with the activation of PC-PLC. The xanthogenate tricyclodecan-9-yl (D609), a specific and selective inhibitor of PC-PLC, blocked the cytotoxic action of TNF on L929 and Wehi164 cells. In vivo, D609 prevented both adhesion molecule expression in the pulmonary vasculature and the accompanying leukocyte infiltration in TNF-treated mice. More strikingly, D609 protects BALB/c mice from lethal shock induced either by TNF, lipopolysaccharide, or staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Together these findings imply PC-PLC as an important mediator of the pathogenic action of TNF, suggesting that PC-PLC may serve as a novel target for anti-inflammatory TNF antagonists.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peripherally selective opioids may be beneficial in visceral pain management due to absence of centrally mediated side effects. The objectives of this study were: (1) to assess the effects of a peripherally selective tetrapeptide kappa-opioid receptor agonist, CR665, on experimental pain from multi-modal stimulation of skin, muscle, and viscera, and (2) contrast these effects with those of oxycodone (centrally acting opioid). METHODS: The study was designed as a single-center, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled, double-dummy, three-way, crossover study in healthy males. Subjects received the following treatments in randomized order: (1) CR665 (0.36 mg/kg) administered intravenously over 1 h, (2) oxycodone (15 mg) administered orally, and (3) placebo administered intravenously and orally. The following pain tests were used: (1) cutaneous pinch pain tolerance threshold, (2) pressure pain detection and tolerance thresholds, (3) cuff pressure pain tolerance threshold, and (4) pain rating thresholds to distension and thermal stimulation of the esophagus. Measurements were performed before dosing and at 30, 60, and 90 min after dosing. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, oxycodone elevated cutaneous pinch pain tolerance (P &lt; 0.001) and cuff pressure pain tolerance threshold (P &lt; 0.001), as well as pain rating thresholds (visual analogue scale = 7) to esophageal distension (P &lt; 0.001) and thermal stimulation (P &lt; 0.002). Compared to placebo, CR665 significantly increased the pain rating threshold to esophageal distension (P &lt; 0.005) but reduced the pain tolerance threshold to skin pinching (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: CR665 had a selective effect on visceral pain. Oxycodone exhibited a generalized effect, elevating thresholds for cutaneous, deep somatic, and visceral pain stimulation.",

YM440 has unique pharmacological profiles both in vitro and in vivo, but, it is not clear whether the compound has a significant effect on hepatic or peripheral insulin response throughout the body. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of YM440 on hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance in Zucker fatty (ZF) rats using the euglycemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique. Treatment of ZF rats with YM440 (300 mg/kg per day) for 2 weeks significantly decreased plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin without inducing obesity. YM440 caused a 2-fold increase in the glucose infusion rate during euglycemic clamping compared with the vehicle control. YM440 also decreased the percent change in hepatic glucose production rate caused by intravenous insulin infusion in ZF rats. YM440 had no significant effect on the glucose disposal rate. These results indicate that YM440 ameliorates hepatic, but not peripheral insulin resistance in ZF rats. These findings strongly suggest that the main target organ of YM440 is the liver, unlike other PPARgamma agonist.",

    "title": "Modulation of retinoic acid receptor function alters the growth inhibitory response of oral SCC cells to retinoids.",
    "abstract": "Retinoids have been shown to inhibit the growth of many human tumor cells including breast, ovarian and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). While the exact mechanism of retinoid mediated growth suppression is not known, a role for the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) has been established in both the breast and ovarian tumor cell models. We set out to determine if modulation of RAR/RXR function would alter the retinoid sensitivity of oral SCC cells. We found that the growth of SCC cells was significantly inhibited by treatment with either all-trans-retinoic acid (trans-RA) or the synthetic, conformationally restricted RARgamma selective retinoids MM11254 and MM11389. In order to demonstrate a role for RAR/RXR function in this process, stable oral SCC cell clones constitutively overexpressing the dominant negative mutant RARbeta2 (R269Q) were prepared and shown to exhibit reduced RAR/RXR transcriptional transactivation activity. We found that oral SCC cells exhibiting reduced RAR/RXR function became resistant to growth inhibition by all-trans-RA, MM11254 and MM11389. Likewise, treatment of oral SCC cells with the RARgamma antagonist MM11253 was found to block the ability of MM11254 and MM11389 to inhibit SCC cell growth. Thus, modulation of RAR function through the use of RAR-gamma selective agonists, an RAR-gamma selective antagonist or a pan-RAR dominant negative mutant significantly alters the growth inhibitory response of oral SCC cells to retinoids.",

ANG II was infused alone or in the presence of AT1 inhibitor [losartan (10(-5) M) or CL-329167 (10(-7) M)] or AT2 inhibitor [CG-42112A (10(-8) M]. ANG II alone caused less increase in coronary vascular resistance (CVR) in LVH compared with control hearts (19 vs. 39%; P &lt; 0.01), although baseline CVR was higher in LVH hearts. This was prevented by AT1 but not AT2 antagonists. ANG II also increased LV end-diastolic pressure in LVH hearts, signifying decreased diastolic relaxation that was prevented by AT1 but not AT2 inhibition. Characterization of ANG II binding sites in LV membrane preparations revealed similar dissociation constants between groups (1.6 +/- 0.95 vs. 2.2 +/- 2.0 nM; not significant) but lower maximum binding capacity in the LVH group (21.1 +/- 5.9 vs. 33.5 +/- 3.0 fmol/mg protein; P &lt; 0.05). Competition assays demonstrated that control left ventricles contain predominantly the AT1 subtype (68.8 +/- 20%), whereas LVH ventricles contain primarily the putative AT2 subtype (59.8% +/- 10.8%; P &lt; 0.05). This suggests that receptor subtype redistribution occurs in LVH with AT1 subtype down-regulation. Nonetheless, the AT1 subtype mediates the effects of ANG II on coronary tone and diastolic dysfunction in pressure-overload hypertrophy.",

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Equilibrium binding, dissociation and competition studies with various B(2) receptor ligands and [(3) H]-JSM10292 were performed at 4 C and 37 C. The experiments were carried out using HEK293 cells stably (over)expressing wild-type and mutant B(2) receptors of human and animal origin. KEY RESULTS: [(3) H]-JSM10292 bound to B(2) receptors at 4 C and at 37 C with the same high affinity. Its dissociation strongly depended on the temperature and increased when unlabelled B(2) receptor agonists or antagonists were added. [(3) H]-JSM10292 is cell membrane-permeant and thus also bound to intracellular, active B(2) receptors, as indicated by the different 'nonspecific' binding in the presence of unlabelled JSM10292 or of membrane-impermeant BK. Equilibrium binding curves with [(3) H]-JSM10292 and competition experiments with unlabelled JSM10292 and [(3) H]-BK showed a different affinity profile for the wild-type B(2) receptor in different species (man, cynomolgus, rabbit, mouse, rat, dog, pig, guinea pig). Characterization of B(2) receptor mutants and species orthologues combined with homology modelling, using the CXCR4 as template, suggests that the binding site of JSM10292 is different from that of BK but overlaps with that of MEN16132, another small non-peptide B(2) receptor ligand. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: [(3) H]-JSM10292 is a novel, cell membrane-permeant, high-affinity B(2) receptor antagonist that allows direct in detail studies of active, surface and intracellularly located wild-type and mutant B(2) receptors.",

Simultaneous infusion of FR128998 (0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/h) with lipopolysaccharide dose dependently inhibited thrombocytopenia, but not leukopenia. The changes in coagulation parameters of disseminated intravascular coagulation, i.e., prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time and elevated levels of fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products, were also prevented by the treatment with FR128998. In addition, FR128998 attenuated the increase in serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) which appeared during the initial stage of disseminated intravascular coagulation. FR128998 (10 microM) also inhibited the TNF production by peripheral blood leukocytes or alveolar macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide in vitro. Furthermore, TNF production induced by PAF itself in vitro was also inhibited in the presence of FR128998. These data indicate that PAF plays a pivotal role in the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation via TNF production.",

Although risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic with high affinity for D2 receptors, low-dose risperidone treatment is effective without inducing extrapyramidal symptoms. The objective was to test the hypothesis that treatment with low-dose risperidone results in 'limbic selective' D2/D3 receptor blockade in vivo. Dynamic single photon emission tomography (SPET) sequences were obtained over 5 hours after injection of [123I]-epidepride (approximately 150 MBq), using a high-resolution triple-headed brain scanner (Marconi Prism 3000XP). Kinetic modelling was performed using the simplified reference region model to obtain binding potential values. Estimates of receptor occupancy were made relative to a normal volunteer control group (n = 5). Six patients treated with low-dose risperidone (mean = 2.6 mg) showed moderate levels of D2/D3 occupancy in striatum (49.9%), but higher levels of D2/D3 occupancy in thalamus (70.8%) and temporal cortex (75.2%). Occupancy values in striatum were significantly different from thalamus (F (1,4) = 26.3, p &lt; 0.01) and from temporal cortex (F (1,4) = 53.4, p &lt; 0.01). This is the first study to evaluate striatal and extrastriatal occupancy of risperidone. Low dose treatment with risperidone achieves a similar selectivity of limbic cortical over striatal D2/D3 receptor blockade to that of atypical antipsychotics with lower D2/D3 affinity such as clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine. This finding is consistent with the relevance of 'limbic selective' D2/D3 receptor occupancy to the therapeutic efficacy of atypical antipsychotic drugs.",

    "title": "The effects of methamphetamine on serotonin transporter activity: role of dopamine and hyperthermia.",
    "abstract": "Multiple administrations of methamphetamine (METH) rapidly decreased serotonin (5HT) transporter (SERT) function in rat striatum and hippocampus. The purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms/ factors contributing to this METH-induced decrease in SERT function. Multiple high-dose METH injections rapidly decreased 5HT uptake without altering binding of the 5HT transporter ligand paroxetine. Hyperthermia contributed to this deficit in transporter function in striatum and hippocampus, as prevention of METH-induced hyperthermia attenuated this decrease. A role for dopamine (DA) was suggested by findings that pretreatment with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, the D1 antagonist SCH-23390, or the D2 antagonist eticlopride attenuated the METH-induced decrease in striatal, but not hippocampal, SERT activity. These effects were independent of the ability of these DA-antagonizing drugs to prevent METH-induced hyperthermia. These results suggest that DA contributes to the decrease in SERT function caused by multiple METH injections in the striatum, but not hippocampus, and that hyperthermia facilitates these deficits in SERT function in both brain regions. In contrast, the response of SERT to a single administration of METH was DA and hyperthermia independent. These findings suggest that the mechanisms/ factors involved in decreasing SERT activity after a single administration of METH are distinct from that caused by multiple administrations.",

    "title": "Stanozolol and danazol, unlike natural androgens, interact with the low affinity glucocorticoid-binding sites from male rat liver microsomes.",
    "abstract": "Some 17 alpha-alkylated androgens used as anabolic agents, such as stanozolol (ST) and danazol (DA), have specific effects on the liver that are not exerted by testosterone. This gives rise to the possibility that a steroid-binding protein, other than the androgen receptor, could modulate the intracellular actions of these agents. Male rat liver microsomes contain a homogeneous population of [3H]dexamethasone ([3H]DEX)-binding sites which we have denominated low affinity glucocorticoid-binding sites (LAGS). Because glucocorticoids, progestagens, and the synthetic estrogen ethynyl estradiol compete with [3H]DEX for binding to the LAGS, we aimed to study the possible interactions between androgens and the LAGS. To investigate whether several androgens had the capability of interacting with the LAGS, we performed competition experiments. The LAGS had no affinity for testosterone or methyltrienolone (R1881). However, some 17 alpha-alkylated androgens (DA (IC50, 116 nM) &gt; ST &gt;&gt; fluoxymesterone &gt; mestaline &gt; methandriol &gt;&gt; methandrostenolone &gt; methyltestosterone) were able to compete with [3H]DEX binding to liver microsomes. ST and DA were potent inhibitors of [3H]DEX binding to liver microsomes. They decreased both the affinity and the number of [3H]DEX-binding sites, increased the dissociation rate of [3H]DEX from the LAGS, and provoked a time- and dose-dependent inactivation of the [3H]DEX-binding site. These results strongly suggest that ST and DA exert a negative allosteric modulation on [3H]DEX binding to the LAGS. The in vivo administration of ST (but not other androgens) to male rats provoked a time- and dose-dependent decrease in the LAGS level. Full recovery of the LAGS concentration required at least 8 h and was blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors. Such results suggest that ST irreversibly inactivates the [3H]DEX-binding site in vivo as it does in vitro. Taken together, these observations are indicative of an irreversible interaction between some 17 alpha-alkylated androgens and the LAGS both in vitro and in vivo and suggest that ST may be an important pharmacological tool that can be used in the elucidation of the molecular structure of the LAGS. These results also mean that the LAGS are a steroid-binding entity able to distinguish between natural androgens and 17 alpha-alkylated testosterone derivatives used as anabolic agents.",

    "abstract": "The recent approval of a prostate cancer vaccine has renewed hope for anticancer immunotherapies. However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment may limit the effectiveness of current immunotherapies. Antiangiogenic agents have the potential to modulate the tumor microenvironment and improve immunotherapy, but they often are used at high doses in the clinic to prune tumor vessels and paradoxically may compromise various therapies. Here, we demonstrate that targeting tumor vasculature with lower vascular-normalizing doses, but not high antivascular/antiangiogenic doses, of an anti-VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) antibody results in a more homogeneous distribution of functional tumor vessels. Furthermore, lower doses are superior to the high doses in polarizing tumor-associated macrophages from an immune inhibitory M2-like phenotype toward an immune stimulatory M1-like phenotype and in facilitating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell tumor infiltration. Based on this mechanism, scheduling lower-dose anti-VEGFR2 therapy with T-cell activation induced by a whole cancer cell vaccine therapy enhanced anticancer efficacy in a CD8(+) T-cell-dependent manner in both immune-tolerant and immunogenic murine breast cancer models. These findings indicate that vascular-normalizing lower doses of anti-VEGFR2 antibody can reprogram the tumor microenvironment away from immunosuppression toward potentiation of cancer vaccine therapies. Given that the combinations of high doses of bevacizumab with chemotherapy have not improved overall survival of breast cancer patients, our study suggests a strategy to use antiangiogenic agents in breast cancer more effectively with active immunotherapy and potentially other anticancer therapies.",

Hydrophobic interactions also help to optimize polar interactions between the enzyme and the glutathione derivatives, given that the K(i) value for S-(N-hydroxycarbamoyl)glutathione (pi = 0) with the human enzyme is 35-fold larger than the interpolated value for this compound obtained from the log K(i) versus pi plot. Computational studies, in combination with published X-ray crystallographic measurements, indicate that human glyoxalase I binds the syn-conformer of S-(N-aryl-N-hydroxycarbamoyl)glutathiones in which the N-aryl substituents are in their lowest-energy conformations. These studies provide both an experimental and a conceptual framework for developing better inhibitors of this antitumor target enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Structural modification of the so-called 'first-generation' or 'urinary' quinolones has led to a considerable increase in their intrinsic antibacterial activity, together with marked changes in the pharmacokinetic properties. Tissue penetration is the most notable change, and the newer quinolones are comparable with the newer broad spectrum beta-lactams in their clinical spectrum of activity. Marketed compounds in the 4-quinolones group include pefloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin; many more compounds are in various stages of research and development. The 4-quinolones act by inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase, a process which is pH and concentration dependent. The bactericidal activity can be partly abolished if protein synthesis is inhibited by chloramphenicol, or if RNA synthesis is inhibited by rifampicin (rifampin). The antibacterial spectrum of activity includes methicillin- and gentamicin-resistant staphylococci, multiresistant non-fermenters, all Enterobacteriaceae, Legionella, Neisseria species, Branhamella and Haemophilus influenzae. With the exception of norfloxacin, which is only 30 to 40% bioavailable from the oral route, the 4-quinolones are 80 to 100% bioavailable, absorption occurring within 1 to 3 hours. Food does not significantly alter Cmax, AUC or elimination half-life, although tmax, may be increased. The 4-quinolones are widely distributed throughout the body, with volumes of distribution greater than 1.5 L/kg. Protein binding is less than 30% in most cases. Penetration into most tissues is good. With the exception of ofloxacin and lomefloxacin (NY 198), which are metabolically stable, metabolism of the 4-quinolones occurs primarily at the C7 position in the piperazinyl ring. Biotransformation is extensive (85%) with pefloxacin, medium (25 to 40%) with ciprofloxacin and enoxacin, and low (less than 20%) with norfloxacin. Elimination half-lives vary between 3 and 5 hours (ciprofloxacin) and 8 to 14 hours (pefloxacin). Biliary concentrations of the 4-quinolones are 2 to 10 times greater than those in serum or plasma, with several compounds undergoing enterohepatic circulation. There is some evidence that ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin have an active renal tubular excretion pathway. In impaired renal function, reduction of the glomerular filtration rate below 30 ml/min (1.8 L/h) is associated with an increase in elimination half-life and AUC, and a decrease in renal and total clearance of the 4-quinolones, and a decrease in 24-hour urinary recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Human subjects consuming fish oil showed a significant suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in blood monocytes when stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an agonist for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Results with a murine monocytic cell line (RAW 264.7) stably transfected with COX-2 promoter reporter gene also demonstrated that LPS-induced COX-2 expression was preferentially inhibited by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3), the major n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) present in fish oil. Additionally, DHA and EPA significantly suppressed COX-2 expression induced by a synthetic lipopeptide, a TLR2 agonist. These results correlated with the preferential suppression of LPS- or lipopeptide-induced NF kappa B activation by DHA and EPA. The target of inhibition by DHA is TLR itself or its associated molecules, but not downstream signaling components. In contrast, COX-2 expression by TLR2 or TRL4 agonist was potentiated by lauric acid, a saturated fatty acid. These results demonstrate that inhibition of COX-2 expression by n-3 PUFAs is mediated through the modulation of TLR-mediated signaling pathways. Thus, the beneficial or detrimental effects of different types of dietary fatty acids on the risk of the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases may be in part mediated through the modulation of TLRs.",

The BET bromodomains (protein interaction modules that bind acetyl-lysine) have been targeted by potent small-molecule inhibitors, but these inhibitors lack selectivity for individual family members. We developed an ethyl derivative of an existing small-molecule inhibitor, I-BET/JQ1, and showed that it binds leucine/alanine mutant bromodomains with nanomolar affinity and achieves up to 540-fold selectivity relative to wild-type bromodomains. Cell culture studies showed that blockade of the first bromodomain alone is sufficient to displace a specific BET protein, Brd4, from chromatin. Expansion of this approach could help identify the individual roles of single BET proteins in human physiology and disease.",

    "abstract": "Metallothioneins (MTs) are cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins that are found throughout Nature. This ubiquity highlights their importance in essential metal regulation, heavy metal detoxification and cellular redox chemistry. Missing from the current description of MT function is the underlying mechanism by which MTs achieve their proposed biological functions. To date, there have been conflicting reports on the mechanism of metal binding and the structures of the metal binding intermediates formed during metalation of apoMTs. The form of the metal-bound intermediates dictates the metal sequestering and metal-donating properties of the protein. Through a detailed analysis of spectral data from electrospray ionization mass spectromeric and circular dichroism methods we report that Zn(ii) and Cd(ii) metalation of the human MT1a takes place through two distinct pathways. The first pathway involves formation of beaded structures with up to five metals bound terminally to the 20 cysteines of the protein via a noncooperative mechanism. The second pathway is dominated by the formation of the four-metal domain cluster structure M4SCYS11via a cooperative mechanism. We report that there are different pathway preferences for Zn(ii) and Cd(ii) metalation of apo-hMT1a. Cd(ii) binding follows the beaded pathway above pH 7.1 but beginning below pH 7.1 the clustered (Cd4Scys11) pathway begins to dominate. In contrast, Zn(ii) binding follows the terminal, \"beaded\", pathway at all physiologically relevant pH (pH &gt;= 5.2) only following the clustered pathway below pH 5.1. The results presented here allow us to reconcile the conflicting reports concerning the presence of different metalation intermediates of MTs. The conflict regarding cooperative versus noncooperative binding mechanisms is also reconciled with the experimental results described here. These two metal-specific pathways and the presence of radically different intermediate structures provide insight into the multi-functional nature of MT: binding Zn(ii) terminally for donation to metalloenzymes and sequestering toxic Cd(ii) in a cluster structure.",

    "abstract": "Bumetanide is well known for its ability to inhibit the nonconductive Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter. We were surprised in preliminary studies to find that bumetanide in the contraluminal bath also inhibited NaCl absorption in the human sweat duct, which is apparently poor in cotransporter activity. Inhibition was accompanied by a marked decrease in the transepithelial electrical conductance. Because the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel is richly expressed in the sweat duct, we asked whether bumetanide acts by blocking this anion channel. We found that bumetanide 1) significantly increased whole cell input impedance, 2) hyperpolarized transepithelial and basolateral membrane potentials, 3) depolarized apical membrane potential, 4) increased the ratio of apical-to-basolateral membrane resistance, and 5) decreased transepithelial Cl- conductance (GCl). These results indicate that bumetanide inhibits CFTR GCl in both cell membranes of this epithelium. We excluded bumetanide interference with the protein kinase A phosphorylation activation process by \"irreversibly\" phosphorylating CFTR [by using adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) in the presence of a phosphatase inhibition cocktail] before bumetanide application. We then activated CFTR GCl by adding 5 mM ATP. Bumetanide in the cytoplasmic bath (10(-3) M) inhibited approximately 71% of this ATP-activated CFTR GCl, indicating possible direct inhibition of CFTR GCl. We conclude that bumetanide inhibits CFTR GCl in apical and basolateral membranes independent of phosphorylation. The results also suggest that &gt;10(-5) M bumetanide cannot be used to specifically block the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter.",

Its pharmacological effect was studied on carbohydrate and lipid parameters in rats. In starved and fed rats, S 4048 caused a dose-dependent reduction of blood glucose levels with a corresponding increase in hepatic and renal glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate. The major quantitative route of carbon flux in the liver during S 4048-induced inhibition of the glucose-6-phosphatase activity seemed to be glycogenesis. Plasma free fatty acids were increased secondarily due to the S 4048-induced hypoglycemia. Hepatic triglycerides were increased possibly due to increased re-esterification of the readily available free fatty acids. Glucose-6-phosphate translocase inhibitors may be useful for experimentally studying aspects of type 1 glycogen storage disease in laboratory animals as well as for the therapeutic modulation of inappropriately high rates of hepatic glucose production in type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Interferons represent a family of cytokines, which is of central importance in the innate immune response to virus infections. All interferons act as secreted ligands of specific cell surface receptors, eliciting the transcription of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes whose protein products have antiviral activity, as well as antimicrobial, antiproliferative/antitumor, and immunomodulatory effects. Expression of type I and III interferons is induced in virtually all cell types upon recognition of viral molecular patterns, especially nucleic acids, by cytoplasmic and endosomal receptors, whereas type II interferon is induced by cytokines such as IL-12, and its expression is restricted to immune cells such as T cells and NK cells. The effectiveness of the interferon system in counteracting viral infections is reflected by the multitude of inhibitors of interferon induction or interferon action that are encoded by many viruses, preventing their eradication and resulting in the continued coexistence of viruses and vertebrates. The unique biological functions of interferons have led to their therapeutic use in the treatment of diseases such as hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, and certain leukemias.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the effect of 2(4-((2-carboxymethyl)phenyl)ethylamino)-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS 21680), a potent and selective agonist at adenosine A2A receptors, on pulmonary inflammation induced by allergen challenge in the ovalbumin-sensitised, Brown Norway rat. Aerosol administration of ovalbumin (5 mg x ml(-1) for 60 min; calculated dose 0.4 mg x kg(-1)) induced increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid leukocyte numbers, protein content and myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase activities measured 24 h post challenge. CGS 21680 (10 and 100 microg x kg(-1) given intratracheally (i.t.) 30 min before and 3 h after allergen challenge) inhibited dose-dependently all the parameters of inflammation. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with the glucocorticosteroid, budesonide (0.1, 1 and 10 mg x kg(-1) given 3 h prior to ovalbumin challenge). CGS 21680 given i.t. reduced blood pressure in anaesthetised rats at similar doses to those at which anti-inflammatory effects were manifested. Both the anti-inflammatory and hypotensive responses to CGS 21680 were blocked by pretreatment with the selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, 4-(2-(7-amino-2-(2-furyl)(1,2,4)triazolo(2,3-a(1,3,5)triazin-5-yl amino)ethyl)phenol (ZM 241385), 3 mg x kg(-1) p.o., 1 h prior to the agonist. Thus, CGS 21680 manifests broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory activity in a model of allergic asthma in the Brown Norway rat through activation of adenosine A2A receptors. The striking similarity to budesonide, a clinically used anti-inflammatory agent, suggests that adenosine A2A receptor agonists may be useful alternatives to glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of asthma.",

    "abstract": "An important function of hepatocytes is the biliary elimination of endogenous and xenobiotic small molecules, many of which are organic cations. To study this vectorial transport of organic cations, we constructed a double-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney strain II (MDCKII) cell line permanently expressing the human organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1, SLC22A1) in the basolateral membrane and MDR1 P-glycoprotein (MDR1 P-gp, ABCB1), an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent efflux pump for organic cations, in the apical membrane. Additionally, MDCKII single transfectants stably expressing OCT1, MDR1 P-gp, or human organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2, SLC22A2) were generated. Antisera directed against OCT1 or OCT2 specifically detected OCT1 in the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes, OCT2 in tubular epithelial cells of human kidney, and the respective recombinant transporter in the basolateral membrane of MDCKII transfectants. We identified the lipophilic organic cation berberine, a fluorescent plant alkaloid exhibiting a broad range of biological activities, as substrate of OCT1 and OCT2 with Michaelis-Menten constants of 14.8 microM and 4.4 microM, respectively. Berberine also inhibited the uptake of the prototypic cations tetraethylammonium and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium by MDCK-OCT1 and MDCK-OCT2 transfectants. When transfected cells were grown polarized on permeable filter supports, berberine was transferred from the basolateral to the apical compartments many times faster by MDCK-OCT1/MDR1 P-gp double transfectants than by MDCK-OCT1 or MDCK-MDR1 P-gp single transfectants. The specific MDR1 P-gp inhibitor, zosuquidar trihydrochloride (LY335979), strongly inhibited berberine efflux into the apical compartment. The MDCK-OCT1/MDR1 P-gp double transfectants may be useful to identify additional cationic substrates and inhibitors of OCT1 and MDR1 P-gp, including drug candidates.",

The scientific rationale of therapy is to correct both the external factors that cause diabetic foot ulcers and the internal factors that lead to impairment of wound healing. Current research is leading to new therapies that can be divided into the following classes: growth factors, skin substitutes, extracellular matrix proteins, stem cell therapy, gene therapy, protease inhibitors, angiogenesis stimulants, nitric oxide-releasing agents, adenosine agonists, immunostimulants, vasoactive compounds and granulating agents. These therapies should be considered when existing treatments to correct extrinsic factors have failed to heal ulceration in the diabetic foot.",

In the control group, the QT interval was statistically significantly prolonged after thiopental, and the most marked prolongation occurred after suxamethonium. Neither practolol nor metoprolol alone affected the QT interval. Practolol 100 micrograms/kg i.v., but not 40 or 150 micrograms/kg i.v., almost completely reduced the prolongation of the QT interval after suxamethonium. In all doses of 20, 30 and 40 micrograms/kg i.v. metoprolol statistically significantly and dose-dependently reduced the prolongation of the QT interval after thiopental, suxamethonium and laryngoscopy, but the prolongation of the QT interval after intubation still occurred. Practolol and metoprolol alone statistically significantly reduced heart rate, but did not prevent the increase of heart rate after thiopental. The effects on arterial pressure were minimal. Neither practolol nor metoprolol prevented the cardiovascular intubation response. Ventricular ectopic beats after intubation occurred in 20% of the patients in the control group and their incidence ranged from 20 to 27% in the groups pretreated with practolol or metoprolol 20 micrograms/kg. In the groups pretreated with metoprolol 30 or 40 micrograms/kg, ventricular ectopic beats occurred in 5% and 8%, respectively. It is concluded that the selective beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocking agents practolol with ISA, and especially metoprolol without ISA, reduced the prolongation of the QT interval after suxamethonium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The drugs were tested as antagonists of the depolarization of spinal motoneurones induced by bath application of the selective tachykinin NK1 receptor agonist septide-(6-11) (300 nM) for 120 s at 15 min intervals. The antagonists were bath applied and the depolarizations were recorded from lumbar ventral roots of 7 to 12 day old rat and gerbil hemisected spinal cords in vitro.

    "title": "The mechanism of adenosylmethionine-dependent activation of methionine synthase: a rapid kinetic analysis of intermediates in reductive methylation of Cob(II)alamin enzyme.",
    "abstract": "Cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, generating tetrahydrofolate and methionine. During this primary turnover cycle, the enzyme alternates between the active methylcobalamin and cob(I)alamin forms of the enzyme. Formation of the cob(II)alamin prosthetic group by oxidation of cob(I)alamin or photolysis of methylcobalamin renders the enzyme inactive. Methionine synthase from E. coli catalyzes its own reactivation by a reductive methylation that involves electron transfer from reduced flavodoxin and methyl transfer from AdoMet. This process has been proposed to involve formation of a transient cob(I)alamin intermediate that is then trapped by methyl transfer from AdoMet. During aerobic growth of E. coli, electrons for this process are ultimately derived from NADPH, and electron transfer does not generate a detectable level of cob(I)alamin due to the large potential difference between the NADPH/NADP+ couple and the cob(I)alamin/cob(II)alamin couple. In this paper, we show that even in the presence of the strong reductant flavodoxin hydroquinone, cob(I)alamin is not observed as a significant intermediate. We demonstrate, however, that this is due to a rate-limiting reorganization of the cobalt ligand environment from five-coordinate to four-coordinate cob(II)alamin. Mutation of aspartate 757 to glutamate results in a cob(II)alamin enzyme that is approximately 70% four-coordinate, and reductive methylation of this enzyme using flavodoxin hydroquinone as the electron donor proceeds through a kinetically competent cob(I)alamin intermediate. Furthermore, wild-type cob(I)alamin enzyme produced by chemical reduction reacts with AdoMet in a kinetically competent reaction. We provide evidence that methyl transfer from AdoMet to cob(I)alamin enzyme results initially in formation of a five-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme that slowly decays to the active six-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme. We propose a kinetic scheme for reductive methylation of wild-type cob(II)alamin enzyme by adenosylmethionine and flavodoxin hydroquinone in which slow conformational changes mask the relatively fast electron and methyl transfer steps.",

More than 3,500 patients worldwide have received ERT with well-documented beneficial effects on the hematological, visceral, skeletal, and pulmonary manifestations, and with resultant improvement in health-related quality of life. Miglustat, an imino sugar that reversibly inhibits glucosylceramide synthase and reduces intracellular substrate burden, is an oral treatment for patients with type 1 GD that was recently approved in the United States for symptomatic patients with mild to moderate clinical manifestations for whom ERT is not an option. Because responses to miglustat are slower and less robust than those observed with ERT, and because miglustat is associated with significant side effects, clinicians who care for patients with GD should become familiar with the limited indications for miglustat use and the circumstances when it may be prescribed appropriately.

In this study, we investigated the effect of troglitazone, a ligand of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma, on PAI-1 expression and secretion in human adipocytes. METHODS: We used two models: in vitro differentiated subcutaneous and omental adipocytes cultured under serum-free conditions and isolated subcutaneous and omental fat cells kept in suspension culture. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 protein was measured by ELISA, PAI-1 mRNA by a semiquantitative RT-PCR technique. RESULTS: Exposure of in vitro differentiated subcutaneous adipocytes from young normal-weight females to 1 microgram/ml troglitazone for 72 h caused a reduction of both PAI-1 secretion (by 29 +/- 5%; p &lt; 0.01) and PAI-1 mRNA expression (by 26 +/- 3%; p &lt; 0.05).

CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence that troglitazone reduces PAI-1 production in human adipocytes, probably at the transcriptional level. This observation could point to a new beneficial effect of troglitazone, particularly in obese subjects, which could be associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk.",

    "abstract": "5-Chloro-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-fluorouridine (935U83) is a selective anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agent. When tested in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes against fresh clinical isolates of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) obtained from patients naive to AZT (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine [zidovudine]), 935U83 inhibited virus growth with an average 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.8 microM; corresponding IC50s were 0.10 microM for FLT (3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine) and 0.23, 0.49, and 0.03 microM for the approved agents AZT, ddI (2',3'-dideoxyinosine), and ddC (2',3'-dideoxycytosine), respectively. Importantly, 935U83 retained activity against HIV strains that were resistant to AZT, ddI, or ddC. Of additional interest, we were unable to generate virus which was resistant to 935U83 by passaging either HXB2 (AZT-sensitive) or RTMC (AZT-resistant) strains in the presence of high concentrations of 935U83. The anabolic profile of 935U83 was similar to that of AZT, and 935U83 triphosphate was a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Pharmacokinetic evaluation showed good oral bioavailability (86% in mice and 60% in monkeys) and less extensive metabolism to the glucuronide relative to AZT. 935U83 showed low toxicity. In an in vitro assay for toxicity to a human erythrocyte progenitor, erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E), the IC50 for 935U83 (&gt; 400 microM) was more than 1,000-fold those of FLT (0.07 microM) and AZT (0.30 microM). Mild reversible reductions in erythrocytes and associated parameters were seen in mice dosed orally with 2,000 mg of 935U83 per kg per day for 1 and 6 months. In monkeys dosed orally with up to 700 mg/kg/day for 1 and 6 months, the only possible treatment-related finding was cataracts in 1 of 12 animals given the intermediate dose of 225 mg/kg/day. At the highest doses in mice and monkeys, maximal concentrations in plasma were more than 100-fold the anti-HIV IC50s against clinical isolates. This safety profile in animals compares very favorably with that of any of the anti-HIV drugs approved to date and has led us to begin evaluation of 935U83 in patients with HIV infection.",

There was a striking linear correlation between UTI and the number of risk alleles defined by these three SNPs (P &lt; 0.001), suggesting an additive effect on susceptibility.

We used a dopamine antagonist (methylergonovine) to investigate whether dopamine mediated the enhancement of motor patterns in the analogue of operant conditioning.

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic mechanisms are thought to play a central role in the reinforcing effects of cocaine. Similar to cocaine, other local anesthetics bind to the dopamine transporter (DAT) and inhibit DA uptake in rodent and monkey brain. Additionally, local anesthetics are self-administered in rhesus monkeys, indicative of abuse liability. The present study examined the reinforcing and DAT effects of the local anesthetics dimethocaine, procaine and cocaine using in vivo techniques. Monkeys were trained to respond under a second-order schedule for i.v. cocaine administration (0.10 or 0.30 mg/kg/infusion). When responding was stable, dimethocaine (0.030-1.7 mg/kg/ infusion) or procaine (0.10-10 mg/kg/ infusion) was substituted for the cocaine training dose. Dimethocaine administration produced higher response rates compared with that of procaine, and was a more potent reinforcer. Drug effects on behavior were related to DAT occupancy in monkey striatum during neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET). DAT occupancy was determined by displacement of 8-(2-[(18)F]fluroethyl)2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)nortropane (FECNT). DAT occupancy was between 66 and 82% and &lt;10-41% for doses of dimethocaine and procaine that maintained maximum response rates, respectively. Finally, in vivo microdialysis in awake subjects determined drug-induced changes in extracellular DA in the caudate nucleus. There was close correspondence between peak increases in DA and DAT occupancy. Overall, reinforcing effects were consistent with DAT effects determined with in vivo techniques. The results further support a role for the DAT in the abuse liability of local anesthetics.",

    "abstract": "Erythromycin and tylosin are 14- and 16-membered lactone ring macrolides, respectively. The current work shows by means of kinetic and chemical footprinting analysis that both antibiotics bind to Escherichia coli ribosomes in a two-step process. The first step established rapidly, involves a low-affinity binding site placed at the entrance of the exit tunnel in the large ribosomal subunit, where macrolides bind primarily through their hydrophobic portions. Subsequently, slow conformational changes mediated by the antibiotic hydrophilic portion push the drugs deeper into the tunnel, in a high-affinity site. Compared with erythromycin, tylosin shifts to the high-affinity site more rapidly, due to the interaction of the mycinose sugar of the drug with the loop of H35 in domain II of 23 S rRNA. Consistently, mutations of nucleosides U2609 and U754 implicated in the high-affinity site reduce the shift of tylosin to this site and destabilize, respectively, the final drug-ribosome complex. The weak interaction between tylosin and the ribosome is Mg2+ independent, unlike the tight binding. In contrast, both interactions between erythromycin and the ribosome are reduced by increasing concentrations of Mg2+ ions. Polyamines attenuate erythromycin affinity for the ribosome at both sequential steps of binding. In contrast, polyamines facilitate the initial binding of tylosin, but exert a detrimental, more pronounced, effect on the drug accommodation at its final position. Our results emphasize the role of the particular interactions that side chains of tylosin and erythromycin establish with 23 S rRNA, which govern the exact binding process of each drug and its response to the ionic environment.",

    "title": "Neuromuscular blockade, reversal agent use, and operating room time: retrospective analysis of US inpatient surgeries.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Reducing operating room (OR) time is of interest to hospital administrators because of high costs of OR utilization. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) induce muscle relaxation during surgery. Several acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used to reverse neuromuscular blockade to shorten recovery time. This study explored the relationship between elapsed OR time and the use of specific NMBAs and reversal agents among patients undergoing selected surgeries based on data from two large hospitals. Specifically, this study sought to test the hypothesis that the application of reversal agents in surgeries using a neuromuscular block would be associated with a decrease in elapsed OR time. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used clinical data from two large hospitals. The authors selected seven types of surgical cases involving thoracic, cardiac, vascular, abdominal, peripheral, urological, and neurological systems. Eligible cases were elective surgeries performed under general anesthesia and using one or more NMBAs (including rocuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, and/or pancuronium). Multivariate linear regressions were conducted to examine the relationships among neuromuscular blockade, reversal agent use (including neostigmine, pyridostigmine, and edrophonium), and elapsed OR time by controlling for age, gender, and patient comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 9670 surgeries were included in this analysis. The mean elapsed OR time across all surgeries was 227 min, and vecuronium was the most commonly used NMBA. Approximately 67% of all surgeries used a reversal agent. After controlling for confounding factors, use of a reversal agent was shown to be associated with the reduction of elapsed OR time in six of seven types of surgery. The magnitude of this effect ranged from 12 to 46 min of OR time saved. The exception was thoracic surgeries, for which use of a reversal agent was shown to be associated with longer OR time (approximately 26 min). Multivariate regression analyses revealed that the type of NMBA used was also a significant predictor of elapsed time for all surgeries (except cardiac). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis has shown that use of selected neuromuscular blockade reversal agents may lead to more efficient OR resource use.",

    "title": "Comparison of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone with clozapine and olanzapine: inhibition of dorsal raphe cell firing and the role of 5-HT1A receptor activation.",
    "abstract": "Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic agent which binds with high affinity to 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 3.4 nM), in addition to 5-HT1D, 5-HT2, and D2 sites. While it is an antagonist at these latter receptors, ziprasidone behaves as a 5-HT1A agonist in vitro in adenylate cyclase measurements. The goal of the present study was to examine the 5-HT1A properties of ziprasidone in vivo using as a marker of central 5-HT1A activity the inhibition of firing of serotonin-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. In anesthetized rats, ziprasidone dose-dependently slowed raphe unit activity (ED50 = 300 micrograms/kg i.v.) as did the atypical antipsychotics clozapine (ED50 = 250 micrograms/kg i.v.) and olanzapine (ED50 = 1000 micrograms/kg i.v.). Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100,635 (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) prevented the ziprasidone-induced inhibition; the same dose of WAY-100,635 had little effect on the inhibition produced by clozapine and olanzapine. Because all three agents also bind to alpha 1 receptors, antagonists of which inhibit serotonin neuronal firing, this aspect of their pharmacology was assessed with desipramine (DMI), a NE re-uptake blocker previously shown to reverse the effects of alpha 1 antagonists on raphe unit activity. DMI (5 mg/kg i.v.) failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of ziprasidone but produced nearly complete reversal of that of clozapine and olanzapine. These profiles suggest a mechanism of action for each agent, 5-HT1A agonism for ziprasidone and alpha 1 antagonism for clozapine and olanzapine. The 5-HT1A agonist activity reported here clearly distinguishes ziprasidone from currently available antipsychotic agents and suggests that this property may play a significant role in its pharmacologic actions.",

The compound, XR3054, is structurally similar to farnesol, a component of the reaction in which FPTase catalyses transfer of farnesol pyrophosphate to the CAAX recognition motif on proteins. The compound was selected initially because of its ability to inhibit in vitro farnesylation of CAAX recognition peptides with an IC50 of 50 microM. The farnesylation of p21 ras was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of XR3054. Similarly XR3054 was able to reduce the anchorage-independent growth of V12 H-ras transformed NIH 3T3 cells in a focus formation assay in soft agar, with an IC50 value of 30 microM, whilst not affecting the anchorage-independent growth of v-raf transformed cells. XR3054 reduced the phosphorylation of p42 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase in parental NIH 3T3 cells and V12 H-ras transformed NIH 3T3 cells, but constitutively active v-raf transformed cells showed no reduction in phosphorylation of ERK2 in the presence of XR3054. XR3054 inhibited the proliferation of the prostatic cancer cell lines LnCAP and PC3 and the colon carcinoma SW480 and HT1080 (IC50 values of 12.4, 12.2, 21.4 and 8.8 microM, respectively) but was relatively inactive when tested against a panel of breast carcinoma cell lines. The activity did not relate to the presence of mutant or wild-type ras in the cell lines tested. In conclusion XR3054 inhibits ras farnesylation, MAP kinase activation and anchorage-independent growth in NIH 3T3 transformed with v12 H-ras. Since the antiproliferative effect of the compound is not related to the ras phenotype, XR3054 may also have effects on other cell signalling mechanisms.",

Inhibitory effects of lisuride on bindings of [3H]8-OH-DPAT in the hippocampus was almost the same as that of 5-HT (Ki = 0.5 nM) and stronger than those of the 5-HT agonist 5-MeO-DMT (Ki = 2.1 nM) or other ergot derivatives (bromocriptine and pergolide, Ki = 3.0 nM). Lisuride (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), like 8-OH-DPAT, dose-dependently induced a 5-HT behavioral syndrome in rats. Lisuride affected locomotor activity in rats, whereas 8-OH-DPAT did not. In hippocampal EEG of rabbits, lisuride (0.01-0.03 mg/kg, i.v.), like 8-OH-DPAT and diazepam, dose-dependently inhibited rhythmical slow activity (RSA) induced by acoustical stimulation (3100 Hz) and also inhibited the RSA increased by administration of anxiogenic FG7142. In water-lick conflict tests, lisuride (0.05-0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), like diazepam, increased the number of shocks. These findings indicated that lisuride acts as a strong agonist on central 5-HT1A receptors and suggested that lisuride might be a potential anxiolytic.",

    "abstract": "The amyloidogenic cascade is regarded as a key factor at the basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. The aberrant cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) induces an increased production and a subsequent aggregation of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide in limbic and association cortices. As a result, altered neuronal homeostasis and oxidative injury provoke tangle formation with consequent neuronal loss. Cannabidiol (CBD), a Cannabis derivative devoid of psychotropic effects, has attracted much attention because it may beneficially interfere with several Abeta-triggered neurodegenerative pathways, even though the mechanism responsible for such actions remains unknown. In the present research, the role of CBD was investigated as a possible modulating compound of APP processing in SHSY5Y(APP+) neurons. In addition, the putative involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) was explored as a candidate molecular site responsible for CBD actions. Results indicated the CBD capability to induce the ubiquitination of APP protein which led to a substantial decrease in APP full length protein levels in SHSY5Y(APP+) with the consequent decrease in Abeta production. Moreover, CBD promoted an increased survival of SHSY5Y(APP+) neurons, by reducing their long-term apoptotic rate. Obtained results also showed that all, here observed, CBD effects were dependent on the selective activation of PPARgamma.",

    "abstract": "In our efforts to explore marine cyanobacteria as a source of novel bioactive compounds, we discovered a statine unit-containing linear decadepsipeptide, grassystatin A (1), which we screened against a diverse set of 59 proteases. We describe the structure determination of 1 and two natural analogues, grassystatins B (2) and C (3), using NMR, MS, and chiral HPLC techniques. Compound 1 selectively inhibited cathepsins D and E with IC(50)s of 26.5 nM and 886 pM, respectively. Compound 2 showed similar potency and selectivity against cathepsins D and E (IC(50)s of 7.27 nM and 354 pM, respectively), whereas the truncated peptide analogue grassystatin C (3), which consists of two fewer residues than 1 and 2, was less potent against both but still selective for cathepsin E. The selectivity of compounds 1-3 for cathepsin E over D (20-38-fold) suggests that these natural products may be useful tools to probe cathepsin E function. We investigated the structural basis of this selectivity using molecular docking. We also show that 1 can reduce antigen presentation by dendritic cells, a process thought to rely on cathepsin E.",

    "title": "Potential use of an estrogen-glucocorticoid receptor chimera as a drug screen for tissue selective estrogenic activity.",
    "abstract": "SERMs act as ER agonists in bone despite their antagonistic properties in other tissues. As well as inhibiting bone remodelling, this effect may involve stimulation of osteoblast activity, in light of evidence from recent in vivo studies. However, progress in exploring this action has been hampered by a lack of accurate in vitro models. For example, ER antagonists are reported to stimulate reporter assays based on estrogen target genes in osteoblasts, contrary to their inhibitory effects in vivo. We examined whether evaluating global aspects of ER function provides a more accurate reflection of ER activation in osteoblasts, based on the use of morphological and/or transcriptional read-outs with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-receptor chimeras. Osteoblast-like (ROS and U2OS) and breast cancer (MCF7) cells were transfected with a human ERalpha-GFP fusion protein, and treated with ER agonists (17beta-estradiol, and dienestrol), antagonists (ICI 182,780 and ZK 164015) and SERMs (tamoxifen, raloxifene, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) and hexestrol). We investigated cellular compartmentalisation of these constructs by fluorescence microscopy, nuclear mobility by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and global activation of estrogenic transcription using a ERE-luc reporter. SERMs caused a modest increase in ERE-luc activity in osteoblast-like cells (but not in breast cells), and a reduction in nuclear mobility in breast (but not osteoblast-like) cells. These studies were then repeated using a GFP chimera where the human GR ligand binding domain (LBD) was replaced by the human ERalpha LBD (ERGR-GFP), combined with a GRE-luc reporter. Interestingly, SERMs increased both cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of ERGR-GFP, and GRE-luc reporter activity, in osteoblast-like (but not breast) cells. Indeed, transcriptional responses to SERMs in osteoblast-like cells were considerably greater with the ERGR/GRE-luc than the ERalpha/ERE-luc system, 4-HT inducing 300 and 25% increases in reporter activity respectively. ER antagonists were entirely without effect. We conclude that evaluation of global estrogenic activity, as opposed to activation of a specific target gene, provides a more accurate read-out for osteoblast stimulation. In particular, ERGR-mediated GRE-luc activity provides a high signal response to estrogen agonists and SERMs, in a cell context dependent manner closely resembling that observed in vivo. Further studies utilising this system are justified to explore the mechanistic basis for estrogenic stimulation of osteoblast activity, and to identify newer SERMs capable of targeting this activity.",

    "abstract": "1. Replacement of the four-carbon omega-terminus in 9,11-endoxy-10a-homo prostaglandin H2 with a p-fluorophenoxy group produces a compound (EP 171) with very high agonist potency at TP-receptors. 2. On six isolated smooth muscle preparations EP 171 was 33-167 times more potent as a TP-receptor agonist than U-46619 (11,9-epoxymethano PGH2); EC50 values ranged from 45 to 138 pM. The actions of EP 171 were difficult to study because of their slow onset and offset. For example, on the guinea-pig trachea the time required for 50% reversal of EP 171-induced contractions during washout was about 3 h. 3. On the pig pulmonary artery, a more rapidly responding preparation, it was possible to show that the TP-receptor antagonist EP 092 blocked the contractile actions of EP 171 and U-46619 to similar extents: pA2 = 8.09 and 8.15 respectively. 4. EP 171 was also a very potent activator of human blood platelets, being about 90 times more potent than U-46619. Both shape change (0.1 nM) and aggregation (1 nM) were slow in onset, a profile not previously observed for a thromboxane A2-mimetic. 5. When potencies at TP-, EP1-(guinea-pig fundus) and FP-(dog iris sphincter) receptors were compared, EP 171 showed a higher specificity as a TP-receptor agonist than either STA2 or U-46619. These studies also showed that contrary to earlier reports, the guinea-pig fundus does contain TP-receptors mediating muscle contraction. However, the maximal response due to activation of TP-receptors was only about 35% of the PGE2 maximum. 6. Established responses to EP 171 were slowly reversed following addition of a high concentration of a TP-receptor antagonist (EP 092, GR 32191 or BM 13177). Faster reversals of three less potent 16-p-halophenoxy prostanoids and U-46619 were obtained. Half-times for offset (and onset) of agonist action appeared to correlate with potency rather than with lipophilicity. 7. Competition between the agonists and a radio iodinated PTA2 derivative ([125I]-PTA-OH) for binding to TP-receptors on intact human platelets was studied. IC50 values correlated well with aggregating potency, EP 171 having the lowest IC50 of 2.9 nM. The true Ki for EP 171 may be about 1 nM if both its racemic nature and reduction of initial free ligand concentration due to TP-receptor binding are taken into account. 8. It is concluded from a comparison of agonist potency rankings that subclassification of the TP-receptor is not warranted at this time. The factors that may be responsible for the slow kinetics of EP 171 action are discussed.",

    "title": "The effect of oxandrolone treatment on human osteoblastic cells.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Oxandrolone, administered to severely burned children over the first year postburn, produces increased lean body mass by 6 months; however, an increase in total body bone mineral requires 12 months. Consequently, this bone mineral response may be due to increased muscle mass. Alternatively, oxandrolone may act directly on bone. The current study seeks to determine whether oxandrolone can transactivate the androgen receptor in osteoblasts. METHODS: Collagen, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin, and androgen receptor abundance were determined by qRT-PCR, confocal laser scanning microscopy, or immunoquantitative assay. To determine the effect of oxandrolone on gene expression in differentiated cells, osteocytic cultures were grown to confluence in differentiation medium and then treated 24 hours or 5 days with 15 microg/mL oxandrolone. RESULTS: Increased nuclear fluorescence of the androgen receptor and increased cellular type I collagen were observed with oxandrolone at 15 and 30 microg/mL but not at lower doses. Alkaline phosphatase (7%-20%) and osteocalcin (13%-18%) increases were modest but significant. Short-term treatment produced no significant effects, but at 5 days androgen receptor levels were increased while collagen levels were significantly decreased, with little effect on alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, or osteoprotegerin. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest oxandrolone can stimulate production of osteoblast differentiation markers in proliferating osteoblastic cells, most likely through the androgen receptor; however, with longer treatment in mature cells, oxandrolone decreases collagen expression. Thus it is possible that oxandrolone given to burned children acts directly on immature osteoblasts to stimulate collagen production, but also may have positive effects to increase bone mineral through other mechanisms.",

The study included 51 parapneumonic effusions (30 empyema or complicated parapneumonic, 21 noncomplicated parapneumonic), 28 tuberculous, 30 malignant and 30 transudates. Inflammatory markers (tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, polymorphonuclear elastase), fibrinolytic system variables (tissue plasminogen activator (PA), urokinase PA (u-PA), plasminogen activation inhibitor (PAI)-1, PAI-2), and several MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9) and TIMPs (TIMP-1, TIMP-2) were determined by ELISA in plasma and pleural fluid. Elevated MMP-2 and TIMP-1 concentrations were observed in all the pleural fluid samples studied. The group of empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusions showed higher MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-9 concentrations than the remaining exudates. There was no correlation between MMP and TIMP levels in plasma and pleural fluid in this group of effusions. In parapneumonic effusions, MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-9 showed a positive correlation with the inflammatory markers and with u-PA and PAI-1. Moreover, there was a relationship between MMP-8 concentration in pleural fluid and pleural thickening at the end of treatment. In conclusion, elevated metalloproteinase-1, -8 and -9 expression was found in parapneumonic pleural effusions. These metalloproteinases could be implicated in the local inflammatory response existing in this group of effusions.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in DNA gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV genes are frequently encountered in quinolone-resistant mutants of Streptococcus pneumoniae. To investigate the mechanism of their effects at the molecular and cellular levels, we have used an Escherichia coli system to overexpress S. pneumoniae gyrase gyrA and topoisomerase IV parC genes encoding respective Ser81Phe and Ser79Phe mutations, two changes widely associated with quinolone resistance. Nickel chelate chromatography yielded highly purified mutant His-tagged proteins that, in the presence of the corresponding GyrB and ParE subunits, reconstituted gyrase and topoisomerase IV complexes with wild-type specific activities. In enzyme inhibition or DNA cleavage assays, these mutant enzyme complexes were at least 8- to 16-fold less responsive to both sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The ciprofloxacin-resistant (Cip(r)) phenotype was silent in a sparfloxacin-resistant (Spx(r)) S. pneumoniae gyrA (Ser81Phe) strain expressing a demonstrably wild-type topoisomerase IV, whereas Spx(r) was silent in a Cip(r) parC (Ser79Phe) strain. These epistatic effects provide strong support for a model in which quinolones kill S. pneumoniae by acting not as enzyme inhibitors but as cellular poisons, with sparfloxacin killing preferentially through gyrase and ciprofloxacin through topoisomerase IV. By immunoblotting using subunit-specific antisera, intracellular GyrA/GyrB levels were a modest threefold higher than those of ParC/ParE, most likely insufficient to allow selective drug action by counterbalancing the 20- to 40-fold preference for cleavable-complex formation through topoisomerase IV observed in vitro. To reconcile these results, we suggest that drug-dependent differences in the efficiency by which ternary complexes are formed, processed, or repaired in S. pneumoniae may be key factors determining the killing pathway.",

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis allowed rapid and efficient determination of the reaction percentages of each psoralen analog with DNA duplexes containing different binding sites after exposure to UV irradiation. The distribution of cross-linked products and mono-adducts was monitored by both LC-UV and IRMPD-MS methods with the highest ratio of cross-linked products to mono-adducts obtained for 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), psoralen (P), and 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP). Reactions at 5'-TA sites were favored over 5'-AT sites, and duplexes containing two and three binding sites showed extensive binding by the psoralens. 4'-Aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (AMP) bound non-selectively via non-covalent interactions and was the only psoralen analog to show significant binding in the absence of UV irradiation. 8-MOP binding displayed the greatest sequence selectivity among the psoralen analogs. The sites of interstrand cross-linking were determined by fragmentation of the duplex/psoralen complexes by infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), which produced cross-linked product ions containing an intact single strand, the psoralen analog, and either a w(n) or a(n)-B portion of the complementary strand. IRMPD of DNA/AMP complexes after UV irradiation also produced high abundances of the intact single strands with the AMP ligand attached, products indicative of a significant population of mono-adducts.",

    "title": "The validity of scopolamine as a pharmacological model for cognitive impairment: a review of animal behavioral studies.",
    "abstract": "Scopolamine is used as a standard/reference drug for inducing cognitive deficits in healthy humans and animals. Effects are often interpreted in terms of a role of acetylcholine in mnemonic and/or attentional processes. In this paper an overview is given of the effects of scopolamine on animal behavior. Examination of the dose-response curve of systemically administered scopolamine indicates that sensory discrimination and attention are most sensitive to disruption. When higher doses (&gt;0.03mg/kg) are used, deficits in other cognitive and non-cognitive functions (e.g., learning and memory, locomotor activity) are reported. Several behavioral processes (taste aversion, anxiety, short-term memory, attention) are found to be affected after intracerebral injections of scopolamine. It is concluded that effects on learning and memory performance which are observed after higher doses of scopolamine are mediated by (1) primary effects on attention and sensory/stimulus discrimination, (2) non-specific effects on behavior (e.g., locomotor activity, anxiety), and (3) peripheral side-effects (e.g., pupil dilation, salivation). Finally, the validity of scopolamine as a pharmacological model for cognitive impairment is discussed. The use of muscarinic M1 antagonists is suggested as a more selective and effective way of inducing cholinergic-induced cognitive deficits.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ginsenosides are bioactive saponins derived from Panax notoginseng roots (Sanqi) and ginseng. Here, the molecular mechanisms governing differential pharmacokinetics of 20(S)-protopanaxatriol-type ginsenoside Rg1 , ginsenoside Re and notoginsenoside R1 and 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides Rb1, Rc and Rd were elucidated. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Interactions of ginsenosides with human and rat hepatobiliary transporters were characterized at the cellular and vesicular levels. A rifampin-based inhibition study in rats evaluated the in vivo role of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp)1b2. Plasma protein binding was assessed by equilibrium dialysis. Drug-drug interaction indices were calculated to estimate potential for clinically relevant ginsenoside-mediated interactions due to inhibition of human OATP1Bs. KEY RESULTS: All the ginsenosides were bound to human OATP1B3 and rat Oatp1b2 but only the 20(S)-protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides were transported. Human multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/bile salt export pump (BSEP)/multidrug resistance protein-1 and rat Mrp2/Bcrp/Bsep also mediated the transport of the 20(S)-protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides. Glomerular-filtration-based renal excretion of the 20(S)-protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides was greater than that of the 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-type counterparts due to differences in plasma protein binding. Rifampin-impaired hepatobiliary excretion of the 20(S)-protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides was effectively compensated by the renal excretion in rats. The 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides were potent inhibitors of OATP1B3. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Differences in hepatobiliary and in renal excretory clearances caused markedly different systemic exposure and different elimination kinetics between the two types of ginsenosides. Caution should be exercised with the long-circulating 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides as they could induce hepatobiliary herb-drug interactions, particularly when patients receive long-term therapies with high-dose i.v. Sanqi or ginseng extracts.",

METHODS: In 304 Caucasian American NTD families with myelomeningocele or anencephaly, we examined 28 polymorphisms in 11 genes: folate receptor 1, folate receptor 2, solute carrier family 19 member 1, transcobalamin II, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1, serine hydroxymethyl-transferase 1, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homo-cysteine methyltransferase, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), and cystathionine-beta-synthase. RESULTS: Only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BHMT were significantly associated in the overall data set; this significance was strongest when mothers took folate-containing nutritional supplements before conception. The BHMT SNP rs3733890 was more significant when the data were stratified by preferential transmission of the MTHFR rs1801133 thermolabile T allele from parent to offspring. Other SNPs in folate pathway genes were marginally significant in some analyses when stratified by maternal supplementation, MTHFR, or BHMT allele transmission. CONCLUSIONS: BHMT rs3733890 is significantly associated in our data set, whereas MTHFR rs1801133 is not a major risk factor. Further investigation of folate and methionine cycle genes will require extensive SNP genotyping and/or resequencing to identify novel variants, inclusion of environmental factors, and investigation of gene-gene interactions in large data sets.",

    "abstract": "The importance of stress in modifying human behavior and lifestyle is no longer a matter of debate. Although mild stress enhances the immune response and prevents infections, prolonged stress seems to play pathogenic roles in depression and neurodegenerative disorders. The body has developed an adaptive stress response consisting of cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychological changes, which act in concert to eliminate stressors. One of the major components of this response is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, also known as the stress axis. Over the last 30 years, many studies have documented the integrated stress-axis regulation by neurotransmitters. They have also demonstrated that gaseous neuromodulators, such as NO, CO, and H(2)S, regulate the hypothalamic release of neuropeptides. The specific effects (stimulatory vs. inhibitory) of these gases on the stress axis varies, depending on the type of stress (neurogenic or immuno-inflammatory), its intensity (low or high), and the species studied (rodents or humans). This review examines the complex roles of NO, CO, and H(2)S in modulation of stress-axis activity, with particular emphasis on the regulatory effects they exert at the hypothalamic level.",

    "abstract": "The last few years, new therapies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have shown their efficacy in the treatment of several types of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies against the EGFR (e.g. cetuximab, panitumumab) or EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. gefitinib, erlotinib) are generally well tolerated and do not have the severe systemic side-effects usually seen with cytotoxic drugs. A considerable number of patients treated with these EGFR inhibitors, however, develop dermatological side-effects, most frequently an acneiform eruption but also xerosis, eczema, fissures, telangiectasia, hyperpigmentation, hair changes and paronychia with pyogenic granuloma. These skin effects appear to be mechanism-based linked to the inhibition of EGFR action but the exact pathophysiology remains elusive. Left untreated these dermatological side-effects could represent a threat to patient compliance. Therefore effective management is mandatory. Mild cases of acneiform eruption respond well to topical anti-inflammatory acne therapy, whereas tetracyclines are needed to treat moderate to severe cases. This review outlines the broad spectrum of cutaneous side-effects of EGFR inhibitors, discusses possible underlying mechanisms and provides practical guidelines for the management based on literature data and on personal experience.",

    "title": "Activation of cardiac human ether-a-go-go related gene potassium currents is regulated by alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors.",
    "abstract": "Patients with cardiac disease typically develop life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during physical or emotional stress, suggesting a link between adrenergic stimulation and regulation of the cardiac action potential. Human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium channels conduct the rapid component of the repolarizing delayed rectifier potassium current, I(Kr). Previous studies have revealed that hERG channel activation is modulated by activation of the beta-adrenergic system. In contrast, the influence of the alpha-adrenergic signal transduction cascade on hERG currents is less well understood. The present study examined the regulation of hERG currents by alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors. hERG channels and human alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors were heterologously coexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and currents were measured using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Stimulation of alpha(1A)-receptors by applying 20 microM phenylephrine caused hERG current reduction due to a 9.6-mV shift of the activation curve towards more positive potentials. Simultaneous application of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (20 microM) prevented the activation shift. Inhibition of PKC (3 microM Ro-32-0432) or PKA (2.5 microM KT 5720) abolished the alpha-adrenergic activation shift, suggesting that PKC and PKA are required within the regulatory mechanism. The effect was still present when the PKA- and PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites in hERG were deleted by mutagenesis. In summary, cardiac repolarizing hERG/I(Kr) potassium currents are modulated by alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors via PKC and PKA independently of direct channel phosphorylation. This novel regulatory pathway of alpha1-adrenergic hERG current regulation provides a link between stress and ventricular arrhythmias, in particular in patients with heart disease.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in perioperative anticoagulation management using a heparin-concentration-based system (HMS), and its effect on postoperative outcome. METHODS: A total of 39 patients undergoing elective primary open heart surgery were randomly assigned to a heparin-concentration-based system approach (study group: 17 patients) or a standard ACT-based anticoagulation system (control group: 22 patients). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients in the study group received a statistically significant higher dose of heparin (median 29000 IU with IQR 22 500-33 500 IU versus median 19 000 IU with IQR 17 775-21 500 IU; p &lt; 0.001) and a smaller dose of protamine (median 170 mg with IQR 145-190 mg versus median 200 mg with IQR 180-250 mg; p = 0.008) compared to the control group. Postoperative platelet count was significantly higher in the study group (164 +/- 45 x 10(9)/L versus 125 +/- 27 x 10(9)/L, p = 0.002). None of the study patients, but six patients in the control group required transfusion of blood products (p = 0.02). No differences were recorded in postoperative antithrombin activity, bleeding, and other clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: The HMS system, by facilitating maintenance of a stable heparin concentration, and by determining an appropriate dose of protamine, is associated with reduced platelet consumption and does not increase AT-III consumption and postoperative bleeding.",

    "abstract": "Migraine is a chronic, recurrent, disabling condition that affects millions of people in the US and worldwide. Proper acute care treatment for migraineurs is essential for a full return of function and productivity. Triptans are serotonin (5-HT)(1B/1D) receptor agonists that are generally effective, well tolerated and safe. Seven triptans are available worldwide, although not all are available in every country, with multiple routes of administration, giving doctors and patients a wide choice. Despite the similarities of the available triptans, pharmacological heterogeneity offers slightly different efficacy profiles. All triptans are superior to placebo in clinical trials, and some, such as rizatriptan 10 mg, eletriptan 40 mg, almotriptan 12.5 mg, and zolmitriptan 2.5 and 5 mg are very similar to each other and to the prototype triptan, sumatriptan 100 mg. These five are known as the fast-acting triptans. Increased dosing can offer increased efficacy but may confer a higher risk of adverse events, which are usually mild to moderate and transient in nature. This paper critically reviews efficacy, safety and tolerability for the different formulations of sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan.",

Here we report the discovery of inhibitors that fill this void with an unprecedented metal-binding group, trifluoromethyloxadiazole (TFMO), which circumvents the selectivity and pharmacologic liabilities of hydroxamates. We confirm direct metal binding of the TFMO through crystallographic approaches and use chemoproteomics to demonstrate the superior selectivity of the TFMO series relative to a hydroxamate-substituted analog. We further apply these tool compounds to reveal gene regulation dependent on the catalytic active site of class IIa HDACs. The discovery of these inhibitors challenges the design process for targeting metalloenzymes through a chelating metal-binding group and suggests therapeutic potential for class IIa HDAC enzyme blockers distinct in mechanism and application compared to current HDAC inhibitors.",

Quantification was performed with liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The assay has been validated based on the most recent FDA guidelines for bioanalytical validation, and all results were within requirements. FmC is formed under the action of an endogenous protease that is activated upon cell lysis. The biomarker could be detected in A549 human lung cancer cells as well as in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Incubation of A549 cells with AZD3409, a novel prenyl transferase inhibitor, resulted in a significant decrease of the FmC concentration in the lysates.

Escherichia coli K12 mutant strains deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER) or base excision repair (BER) were submitted to increasing concentrations of HN2 or HN1, and the results revealed that damage induced by each chemical demands different DNA repair pathways. Damage induced by HN2 demands the activity of NER with a minor requirement of the BER pathway, while HN1 damage repair depends on BER action, without any requirement of NER function.

The steady-state kinetics revealed time dependent inhibition of PfENR by triclosan, demonstrating that triclosan exhibited slow tight-binding kinetics with PfENR in the presence of these compounds. Additionally, all of them potentiated the binding of triclosan with PfENR by a two-step mechanism resulting in an overall inhibition constant of triclosan in the low picomolar concentration range. The high affinities of tea catechins and the potentiation of binding of triclosan in their presence are readily explained by molecular modeling studies.

    "abstract": "The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in pancreatic beta cells are critical in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Although electrophysiological studies provide clues to the complex control of KATP channels by ATP, MgADP, and pharmacological agents, the molecular mechanism of KATP-channel regulation remains unclear. The KATP channel is a heterooligomeric complex of SUR1 subunits of the ATP-binding-cassette superfamily with two nucleotide-binding folds (NBF1 and NBF2) and the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits. Here, we report that MgATP and MgADP, but not the Mg salt of gamma-thio-ATP, stabilize the binding of prebound 8-azido-[alpha-32P]ATP to SUR1. Mutation in the Walker A and B motifs of NBF2 of SUR1 abolished this stabilizing effect of MgADP. These results suggest that SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP strongly at NBF1 and that MgADP, either by direct binding to NBF2 or by hydrolysis of bound MgATP at NBF2, stabilizes prebound 8-azido-ATP binding at NBF1. The sulfonylurea glibenclamide caused release of prebound 8-azido-[alpha-32P]ATP from SUR1 in the presence of MgADP or MgATP in a concentration-dependent manner. This direct biochemical evidence of cooperative interaction in nucleotide binding of the two NBFs of SUR1 suggests that glibenclamide both blocks this cooperative binding of ATP and MgADP and, in cooperation with the MgADP bound at NBF2, causes ATP to be released from NBF1.",

    "abstract": "Elevated serum levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and high tumor expression of c-Met are both indicators of poor overall survival from ovarian cancer (OVCA). In the present study, we evaluated the role of the HGF signaling pathway in OVCA cell line chemoresistance and OVCA patient overall survival as well as the influence of HGF/c-Met signaling inhibition on the sensitivity of OVCA cells to combinational carboplatin plus paclitaxel therapy. The prevalence of the HGF receptor, c-Met, was determined by immunohistochemistry in primary OVCA samples (n=79) and OVCA cell lines (n=41). The influence of the c-Met-specific inhibitor MK8033 on OVCA cell sensitivity to combinations of carboplatin plus paclitaxel was examined in a subset of OVCA cells (n=8) by CellTiter-Blue cell viability assays. Correlation tests were used to identify genes associated with response to MK8033 and carboplatin plus paclitaxel. Identified genes were evaluated for influence on overall survival from OVCA using principal component analysis (PCA) modeling in an independent clinical OVCA dataset (n=218). Immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that 83% of OVCA cells and 92% of primary OVCA expressed the HGF receptor, c-Met. MK8033 exhibited significant anti-proliferative effects against a panel of human OVCA cell lines. Combination index values determined by the Chou-Talalay isobologram equation indicated synergistic activity in combinations of MK8033 and carboplatin plus paclitaxel. Pearson's correlation identified a 47-gene signature to be associated with MK8033-carboplatin plus paclitaxel response. PCA modeling indicated an association of this 47-gene response signature with overall survival from OVCA (P=0.013). These data indicate that HGF/c-Met pathway signaling may influence OVCA chemosensitivity and overall patient survival. Furthermore, HGF/c-Met inhibition by MK8033 represents a promising new therapeutic avenue to increase OVCA sensitivity to carboplatin plus paclitaxel.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme is upregulated in inflammatory diseases, as well as in epithelial cancers, and has an established role in angiogenesis and tissue repair. OBJECTIVE: Because of these physiological effects and the widespread use of the selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, we wanted to determine if inhibition of COX-2 would affect incisional skin wound healing. METHODS: Using a cutaneous full-thickness, sutured, incisional wound model in hairless SKH-1 mice, we evaluated the role of COX-2 in the wound healing process by comparing the effects of a nonselective COX inhibitor, diclofenac, with a selective COX-2 inhibitor, SC-791. Healing was monitored for up to 28 days postincision histologically and for recovery of wound strength. RESULTS: COX-2 expression was observed over the first week of healing, peaking at day 3 and was not affected by treatment with the selective COX-2 or nonselective COX inhibitors. Infiltrating macrophages, as well as keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts at the wound site, expressed COX-2. Neither selective COX-2, nor nonselective COX inhibition had a significant effect on the macroscopic or microscopic morphology of the wounds, whereas dexamethasone treatment resulted in epidermal and granulation tissue atrophy. In addition, neither selective COX-2, nor nonselective COX inhibition altered keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, dermal angiogenesis or the recovery of wound tensile strength, whereas dexamethasone reduced the tensile strength of the wounds by 30-38% throughout the healing period. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that selective COX-2 inhibition does not affect the healing of surgical skin wounds.",

    "abstract": "The human A3 adenosine receptor was cloned from a striatal cDNA library using a probe derived from the homologous rat sequence. The cDNA encodes a protein of 318 amino acids and exhibits 72% and 85% overall identity with the rat and sheep A3 adenosine receptor sequences, respectively. Specific and saturable binding of the adenosine receptor agonist N6-(4-amino-3-[125I]iodobenzyl)adenosine [125I]ABA was measured on the human A3 receptor stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells with a Kd = 10 nM. The potency order for adenosine receptor agonists was N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) &gt; or = (R)-N6-phenyl-2-propyladenosine [(R)-PIA] &gt; N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) &gt; (S)-N6-phenyl-2-propyladenosine [(S)-PIA]. The human receptor was blocked by xanthine antagonists, most potently by 3-(3-iodo-4-aminobenzyl)-8-(4-oxyacetate)phenyl-1-propylxanthine (I-ABOPX) with a potency order of I-ABOPX &gt; 1,3-dipropyl-8-(4-acrylate)phenylxanthine &gt; or = xanthine amino congener &gt;&gt; 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine. Adenosine, NECA, (R)- and (S)-PIA, and CPA inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 30-40% in stably transfected cells; I-ABA is a partial agonist. When measured in the presence of antagonists, the dose-response curves of NECA-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation were right-shifted. Antagonist potencies determined by Schild analyses correlated well with those established by competition for radioligand binding. The A3 adenosine receptor transcript is widespread and, in contrast to the A1, A2a, and A2b transcripts, the most abundant expression is found in the lung and liver. The tissue distribution of A3 mRNA is more similar to the widespread profile found in sheep than to the restricted profile found in the rat. This raises the possibility that numerous physiological effects of adenosine may be mediated by A3 adenosine receptors.",

At all Cr levels, chromium accumulation by various plant tissues followed the order roots &gt; leaves &gt; rhizomes. Approximately 93% of total chromium present in the medium was accumulated by plants at lowest conentration (1 microM) used in the experiment. Chromium-induced toxicity appears at 1 microM chromium resulting in the build-up of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and reduced activities of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) and nitrate reductase (NR), total chlorophyll (Chl) and protein contents. Ch1a was more sensitive than Ch1b to chromium toxicity. It could be inferred that chromium toxicity is not located at the level of ALA synthesis, but, probably at the ALAD activity which was more severely affected during chlorophyll biosynthesis. Finally, impaired chlorophyll biosynthesis resulted in reduced total chlorophyll content.",

The alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockers rauwolscine and yohimbine antagonized competitively 5 HT-induced contractions. The estimated equilibrium dissociation constants KB (-log mol/l) were 7.1 for rauwolscine and 7.3 for yohimbine. The affinity of yohimbine for the receptors mediating the response to 5 HT appears to be 10 times higher than for postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptors but 10 times lower than for postsynaptic vascular alpha 2-adrenoceptors. 2. (-)-Noradrenaline and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor-selective agonist B-HT 920 caused maximum contractions amounting to only 20% and 2%, respectively, of the maximum 5 HT effects. Neither 60 mumol/l B-HT 920 nor 1 mumol/l prazosin antagonized the 5 HT effect. 3. Ketanserin was a competitive antagonist (KB = 9.2 (-log mol/l] of the effects of 5 HT. Combinations of rauwolscine or yohimbine with ketanserin antagonized the 5 HT effects as expected from competition of the 4 drugs for a single class of receptor. 4. The evidence is consistent with an interaction of 5 HT, ketanserin, rauwolscine and yohimbine with 5 HT2 receptors. alpha-Adrenoceptors only play a minor role in large coronary arteries and appear not to be involved in the 5 HT-induced contractions. A possible clinical involvement of 5 HT in coronary artery spasm is discussed.",

However, the effect of bepridil on mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) (mitoK(ATP)) channels remains unclear. The objective of the present study was to determine whether bepridil activates mitoK(ATP) channels and confers cardioprotection. SarcK(ATP) channels composed of Kir6.2+SUR2A in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were examined using the patch-clamp technique. Flavoprotein fluorescence in guinea pig ventricular cells and matrix volume in isolated rat heart mitochondria were measured to assay mitoK(ATP) channel activity. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](m)) was measured by loading cells with rhod-2 fluorescence. Coronary-perfused guinea pig ventricular muscles were subjected to 35-min no-flow ischemia followed by 60-min reperfusion. Bepridil (10 microM) completely inhibited the pinacidil-induced Kir6.2+SUR2A channel current expressed in HEK 293 cells. Bepridil reversibly oxidized the flavoprotein and increased mitochondrial matrix volume in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, bepridil significantly attenuated the ouabain-induced increase of [Ca(2+)](m). Pretreatment with bepridil for 5 min before ischemia improved the recovery of developed tension measured after 60 min of reperfusion. These effects of bepridil were abolished by the mitoK(ATP) channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (500 microM) and by the nonselective K(ATP) channel blocker glisoxepide (10 microM). Our results indicate that bepridil is an opener of mitoK(ATP) channels but an inhibitor of sarcK(ATP) channels and exerts a direct cardioprotective effect on native cardiac myocytes. This is the first report of a unique modulator of K(ATP) channels; bepridil would be expected to mitigate ischemic injury while blunting arrhythmias.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Histamine is a chemical mediator that acts at four known types of histamine receptors and has been widely implicated in the development of nociception and neuropathic pain. Blocking histamine H(1) and H(2) receptors has been shown to reduce hyperalgesia following nerve injury, but the role of histamine H(3) and H(4) receptors in neuropathic pain has not been studied. Here, we used blockers of histamine H(3) and H(4) receptors to assess their effects on neuropathic pain behavior and mast cell numbers following peripheral nerve injury. In addition, we assessed the effect of activating H(4) receptors on neuropathic pain behavior. METHODS: Rats were subjected to a partial ligation of the sciatic nerve, a model of neuropathic pain, and were treated either systemically or locally (hindpaw) with the H(3)/H(4) receptor inverse agonist thioperamide, the specific H(4) receptor antagonist JNJ 7777120, or the H(4) receptor agonist VUF 8430. Measurements of mechanical hyperalgesia were carried out by Randall-Selitto test for 1-3 weeks, and sciatic nerve tissues were analyzed for numbers of intact mast cells by histology at 9 h after surgery. RESULTS: Rats treated with thioperamide or JNJ 7777120 showed significantly enhanced mechanical hyperalgesia after partial ligation of the sciatic nerve. The number of intact mast cells in the injured nerve of these rats was higher than in control rats suggesting reduced mast cell degranulation, but was still significantly lower than in intact nerves. Rats treated with VUF 8430 showed significantly reduced mechanical hyperalgesia. CONCLUSION: We propose that the increase in mechanical hyperalgesia produced by thioperamide and JNJ 7777120 and the decrease in mechanical hyperalgesia produced by VUF 8430 may represent a direct effect of these agents on mechanospecific primary afferents, or an indirect effect of these agents via injury-induced inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) is an outer mitochondrial membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of arylalkylamine neurotransmitters and has been a target for a number of clinically used drug inhibitors. The 1.7-A structure of the reversible isatin-MAO-B complex has been determined; it forms a basis for the interpretation of the enzyme's structure when bound to either reversible or irreversible inhibitors. 1,4-Diphenyl-2-butene is found to be a reversible MAO-B inhibitor, which occupies both the entrance and substrate cavity space in the enzyme. Comparison of these two structures identifies Ile-199 as a \"gate\" between the two cavities. Rotation of the side chain allows for either separation or fusion of the two cavities. Inhibition of the enzyme with N-(2-aminoethyl)-p-chlorobenzamide results in the formation of a covalent N(5) flavin adduct with the phenyl ring of the inhibitor occupying a position in the catalytic site overlapping that of isatin. Inhibition of MAO-B with the clinically used trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine results in the formation of a covalent C(4a) flavin adduct with an opened cyclopropyl ring and the phenyl ring in a parallel orientation to the flavin. The peptide bond between the flavin-substituted Cys-397 and Tyr-398 is in a cis conformation, which allows the proper orientation of the phenolic ring of Tyr-398 in the active site. The flavin ring exists in a twisted nonplanar conformation, which is observed in the oxidized form as well as in both the N(5) and the C(4a) adducts. An immobile water molecule is H-bonded to Lys-296 and to the N(5) of the flavin as observed in other flavin-dependent amine oxidases. The active site cavities are highly apolar; however, hydrophilic areas exist near the flavin and direct the amine moiety of the substrate for binding and catalysis. Small conformational changes are observed on comparison of the different inhibitor-enzyme complexes. Future MAO-B drug design will need to consider \"induced fit\" contributions as an element in ligand-enzyme interactions.",

The examination of a series of base-modified analogues of CldAdo has shown that several other compounds have similar inhibitor properties, and has indicated that 6-benzyloxy-2-chloro-9-(2'-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)purine is the most potent inhibitor with a Ki value of 0.5 microM, competitive with respect to inosine (Ino). CldAdo itself and its base-modified analogues, discounting those substituted at C(8), are also substrates for the E. coli PNP and undergo rapid glycosidic bond cleavage. CldAdo is degraded with substrate efficiency, i.e. Vmax/Km similar to that observed for Ino (130%), although the individual kinetic constants, Km and Vmax, are both approximately an order of magnitude lower than for Ino. All compounds tested are totally inactive as substrates and inhibitors for mammalian (calf spleen) PNP and therefore constitute a new class of potent selective, although cleavable, inhibitors of bacterial phosphorylases. 8-Bromo-2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine and 8-thio-2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine are the only base-modified CldAdo derivatives showing inhibitory activity against MOLT-3 (acute T-cell leukemia) and U-937 (histiocytic lymphoma) cells and, as shown in this study, are resistant to degradation by E. coli PNP. The above-mentioned results suggest that both analogues could be effective as oral cytotoxic agents that are noncleavable by enteric bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of immediate-early gene induction has proven to be a useful method for delineating the neural systems that subserve antipsychotic drug actions. In order to differentiate the sites and mechanisms of action of typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs, we examined the effects of antipsychotic drugs on Fos protein expression in the medial prefrontal cortex. The atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine selectively increased the number of neurons that expressed Fos-like immunoreactivity in the prefrontal cortex, targeting the deep layers of the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices. Pyramidal cells were the major cell type in which Fos was expressed. A small number of calbindin-like immunoreactive, but not parvalbumin- or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase-containing, interneurons also expressed Fos after clozapine challenge. Immunoblot studies revealed that clozapine induced Fos protein in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices. Other antipsychotic drugs that are D2 receptor antagonists, including haloperidol, raclopride, sulpiride, remoxipride and loxapine, did not alter Fos expression. The clozapine-induced increase in Fos expression was also not attributable to actions at the D1 dopamine receptor, nor to serotonin type 2a/2c receptor antagonism or combined serotonin type 2-D2 dopamine receptor antagonism. The ability of clozapine to block alpha 1-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic receptors did not contribute to the unique actions of clozapine. Despite the inability of dopamine receptor antagonists other than clozapine to elicit an increase in Fos expression, both the mixed D1-D2 dopamine agonist apomorphine and the D2-like agonist quinpirole increased Fos protein levels in the prefrontal cortex. However, neither pretreatment with sulpiride to block D2/3/4 dopamine receptors or SCH 23390 to block D1/5 dopamine receptors modified the Fos response to clozapine. Since dopamine receptor antagonist pretreatments did not attenuate the clozapine-elicited Fos expression, but D2 agonists increased cortical Fos expression, clozapine may act in the prefrontal cortex on an as yet undefined dopamine receptor. In contrast to the nucleus accumbens shell, where all antipsychotic drugs increase Fos expression, only clozapine induced Fos in the medial prefrontal cortex. These observations suggest that the ability of clozapine to treat schizophrenic patients who are resistant to the therapeutic benefits of conventional antipsychotic drugs may occur through actions in the prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine kinase (AK) is an enzyme responsible for converting endogenous adenosine (ADO) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in an adenosine triphosphate- (ATP-) dependent manner. The structure of AK consists of two domains, the first a large alpha/beta Rossmann-like nucleotide binding domain that forms the ATP binding site, and a smaller mixed alpha/beta domain, which, in combination with the larger domain, forms the ADO binding site and the site of phosphoryl transfer. AK inhibitors have been under investigation as antinociceptive, antiinflammatory, and anticonvulsant as well as antiinfective agents. In this work, we report the structures of AK in complex with two classes of inhibitors: the first, ADO-like, and the second, a novel alkynylpyrimidine series. The two classes of structures, which contain structurally similar substituents, reveal distinct binding modes in which the AK structure accommodates the inhibitor classes by a 30 degrees rotation of the small domain relative to the large domain. This change in binding mode stabilizes an open and a closed intermediate structural state and provide structural insight into the transition required for catalysis. This results in a significant rearrangement of both the protein active site and the orientation of the alkynylpyrimidine ligand when compared to the observed orientation of nucleosidic inhibitors or substrates.",

    "abstract": "The covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol to filgrastim results in a new molecule pegfilgrastim, which has a significantly longer half-life than filgrastim. It is likely that the clearance of both filgrastim and pegfilgrastim involves granulocyte colony simulating factor (G-CSF) receptor binding, but the pharmacokinetics of these drugs have not been compared in mice with and without a functional G-CSF receptor. We sought to clarify the role of receptor-mediated clearance of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim using wild-type (WT) mice or mice with a non-functional G-CSF-R (knockout, KO). We administered single doses of filgrastim or pegfilgrastim (10 or 100 microg kg(-1)) intravenously to WT and KO mice. Plasma levels of protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at preset time points, and AUC, MRT, CL, V(d), and T(1/2) were calculated. When compared with WT mice, the G-CSF-R KO mice had significantly greater AUC, longer MRT, longer T(1/2), and lower clearance. This was the case whether animals received 10 or 100 microg kg(-1) and whether they received filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. The volume of protein distribution was identical among WT and KO mice. However, the V(d) was larger after pegfilgrastim dosing than after filgrastim dosing. In both WT and KO mice, increasing the dose of figrastim or pegfilgrastim resulted in a proportional increase in the AUC. A functional G-CSF-R is an important mechanism in the plasma clearance of both filgrastim and pegfilgrastim.",

We investigated signal transduction from TG1019 following stimulation with 5-oxo-ETE and role of TG1019 in 5-oxo-ETE-induced chemotaxis, using Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing TG1019 (CHO/TG1019 cells). 5-Oxo-ETE induced intracellular calcium mobilization and rapid activation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways in CHO/TG1019 cells. CHO/TG1019 cells stimulated with 5-oxo-ETE and other eicosanoids exhibited chemotaxis with efficacies related to agonistic activity of each eicosanoid for TG1019. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor (U73122) or a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), markedly suppressed 5-oxo-ETE-induced chemotaxis, whereas pretreatment with a MEK inhibitor (PD98059) had no significant effect on the chemotaxis.

In isolated guinea-pig tracheae SK&amp;F S-106203 was a potent, competitive antagonist of leukotriene (LT) D4-induced contractions (pA2 = 7.6). SK&amp;F S-106203 was also a potent antagonist of LTE4-induced contractions (pKB = 7.3), but had little effect on those elicited by LTC4 (pKB = 5.5). SK&amp;F S-106203 (10 microM) had no effect on contractions produced by histamine, carbachol, KCl, U-44069, PGF2 alpha or PGD2. In addition, SK&amp;F S-106203 (10 microM) did not inhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity of several PDE isozymes. In guinea-pig lung membrane preparations, SK&amp;F S-106203 was a potent antagonist of 3H-LTD4 binding with a Ki = 19.4 +/- 2.1 nM (n = 5). The pharmacokinetic profile of SK&amp;F S-106203 was determined in unanesthetized guinea-pigs. Following an i.v. (bolus) dose (25 mg/kg), SK&amp;F S-106203 disappeared from plasma in a biphasic fashion with half-lives of 0.1 h (50% of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, AUC) and 11 h. The AUC obtained for SK&amp;F S-106203 following i.v. administration was 87.3 +/- 7.5 micrograms-h/ml. Following an oral dose of SK&amp;F S-106203 (100 mg/kg), the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and the time Cmax was achieved (Tmax) were 21.62 +/- 2.26 micrograms/ml and 4 +/- 1 h, respectively; the AUC was 279.9 +/- 41.8 micrograms-h/ml. Studies examining the effects of i.v. infusion of SK&amp;F S-106203 revealed that marked inhibition of LTD4-induced bronchospasm was produced with steady-state plasma levels of SK&amp;F S-106203 less than 1 microgram/ml (less than 2 microM). Oral (p.o.) pretreatment with 100 mumol/kg SK&amp;F S-106203 for up to 24 h essentially abolished LTD4-induced bronchospasm; this correlated with sustained plasma concentrations of greater than 2 micrograms/ml. The results indicate that in guinea-pig airways, SK&amp;F S-106203 is a potent and selective LT receptor antagonist that is active via aerosol, oral and i.v. routes of administration. When given orally, SK&amp;F S-106203 is highly bioavailable and has a very long duration of action which correlates with the pharmacokinetic profile of the compound. SK&amp;F S-106203 may be useful therapy in asthma and other disorders in which the LTs are thought to play a prominent pathophysiological role.",

General strategies for the development of inhibitors of these enzymes are needed. Several modular strategies which rely on phosphotyrosine mimics are known for PTP inhibitors. Previous strategies include phosphonomethylphenylalanine (Pmp) derivatives which act as competitive inhibitors. Pmp amino acid derivatives have been used to develop specific inhibitors by incorporation into sequences recognized by the PTP of interest. We report the synthesis of a new phosphonotyrosine analog, l-phosphonobromomethylphenylalanine (BrPmp), which acts as an inhibitor of PTPs. The BrPmp derivative was prepared as an Fmoc-protected amino acid which can be used in standard solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) methods. The synthesis of the protected amino acid derivative requires 11 steps from tyrosine with a 30% overall yield. Enzyme inhibition studies with the PTP CD45 demonstrate that BrPmp derivatives are irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme. A tripeptide which incorporated BrPmp had increased inhibitory potency against PTP relative to BrPmp alone, confirming that the incorporation of BrPmp into peptide sequences provides additional context to improve enzyme binding.",

    "abstract": "Fatty acid synthase (FAS), the key metabolic multi-enzyme that is responsible for the terminal catalytic step in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, plays an active role in the development, maintenance, and enhancement of the malignant phenotype in a subset of breast carcinomas. We recently described that a molecular bi-directional cross-talk between FAS and the Her-2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene is taking place at the level of transcription, translation, and activity in breast cancer cells. Because Her-2/neu has been linked with altered sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, we envisioned that FAS gene expression may represent a novel predictive molecular factor for breast cancer response to chemotherapy in a Her-2/neu-related manner. We herein evaluated whether chemotherapy-induced cell damage acts in an epigenetic fashion by inducing changes in the transcriptional activation of FAS gene in breast cancer cells. To evaluate this option, FAS- and Her-2/neu-overexpressing SK-Br3 breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with a FAS promoter-reporter construct (FAS-Luciferase) harboring all the elements necessary for high level expression in cancer cells. SK-Br3 cells cultured in the presence of topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) inhibitors doxorubicin and etopoxide (VP-16) demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in FAS promoter activity when compared with control cells growing in drug-free culture conditions. We failed to observe any significant activation of FAS promoter following exposure to the anti-metabolite 5-fluorouracil, the alkylating drug cisplatin, or the microtubule interfering-agents paclitaxel and vincristine. Moreover, the up-regulatory effects of TOP2A inhibitors on the transcriptional activation of FAS gene expression were not significantly decreased when the FAS promoter was damaged at the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-binding site. Considering that FAS inhibition produces profound inhibition of DNA replication and S-phase progression in cancer cells, we finally asked whether a cross-talk between TOP2A and FAS could exhibit a Her-2/neu-related bi-directional nature. TOP2A protein levels were decreased during treatment with the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab while, concomitantly, FAS promoter activity and FAS protein expression were significantly reduced. Of note, when the expression levels of TOP2A protein were analyzed following exposure of SK-Br3 cells to increasing concentrations of the novel slow-binding FAS inhibitor C75, a dose-dependent reduction in TOP2A expression was observed. Although FAS gene is not physically located in the Her-2/neu-TOP2A amplicon, our present findings strongly suggest that a tight functional association between FAS, Her-2/neu and TOP2A genes is taking place in a subset of breast carcinoma cells.",

    "abstract": "Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of l-Ser and tetrahydropteroylglutamate (H(4)PteGlu) to Gly and 5,10-methylene tetrahydropteroylglutamate (CH(2)-H(4)PteGlu). Biochemical and structural studies on this enzyme have implicated several residues in the catalytic mechanism, one of them being the active site lysine, which anchors PLP. It has been proposed that this residue is crucial for product expulsion. However, in other PLP-dependent enzymes, the corresponding residue has been implicated in the proton abstraction step of catalysis. In the present investigation, Lys-226 of Bacillus stearothermophilus SHMT (bsSHMT) was mutated to Met and Gln to evaluate the role of this residue in catalysis. The mutant enzymes contained 1 mol of PLP per mol of subunit suggesting that Schiff base formation with lysine is not essential for PLP binding. The 3D structure of the mutant enzymes revealed that PLP was bound at the active site in an orientation different from that of the wild-type enzyme. In the presence of substrate, the PLP ring was in an orientation superimposable with that of the external aldimine complex of wild-type enzyme. However, the mutant enzymes were inactive, and the kinetic analysis of the different steps of catalysis revealed that there was a drastic reduction in the rate of formation of the quinonoid intermediate. Analysis of these results along with the crystal structures suggested that K-226 is responsible for flipping of PLP from one orientation to another which is crucial for H(4)PteGlu-dependent Calpha-Cbeta bond cleavage of l-Ser.",

    "abstract": "A group of 5-aza-7-substituted-1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2,3-diones (QXs) and the corresponding 5-(N-oxyaza)-7-substituted QXs were prepared and evaluated as antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The in vitro potency of these QXs was determined by inhibition of [3H]-5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid ([3H]DCKA) binding to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)/glycine receptors, [3H]-(S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ([3H]AMPA) binding to AMPA receptors, and [3H]kainate ([3H]KA) binding to KA receptors in rat brain membranes. 5-(N-Oxyaza)-QXs 12a-e all have low micromolar or submicromolar potency for NMDA/glycine receptors and low micromolar potencies for AMPA and KA receptors. QXs 12a-e display 2-12-fold selectivity for NMDA/glycine receptors compared to AMPA receptors, and approximately 2-fold difference between AMPA and KA potency. In contrast to other QXs that either show high selectivity for NMDA (such as ACEA 1021) or AMPA (such as NBQX) receptors, these molecules are broad spectrum antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors. 7-Nitro-5-(N-oxyaza)-QX (12e) is the most potent inhibitor among 12a-e, having IC50 values of 0.69, 1.3, and 2.4 microM at NMDA, AMPA, and KA receptors, respectively. In functional assays on glutamate receptors expressed in oocytes by rat cerebral cortex poly(A+) RNA, 7-chloro-5-(N-oxyaza)-QX (12a) and 7-nitro-5-(N-oxyaza)-QX (12e) have Kb values of 0.63 and 0.31 microM for NMDA/glycine receptors, and are 6- and 4-fold selective for NMDA over AMPA receptors, respectively. 5-(N-Oxyaza)-7-substituted-QXs 12a-e all have surprisingly high in vivo potency as anticonvulsants in a mouse maximal electroshock-induced seizure (MES) model. 7-Chloro-5-(N-oxyaza)-QX (12a), 7-bromo-5-(N-oxyaza)-QX (12b), and 7-methyl-5-(N-oxyaza)-QX (12c) have ED50 values of 0.82, 0.87, and 0.97 mg/kg i.v., respectively. The high in vivo potency of QXs 12a-e is particularly surprising given their low log P values (approximately -2.7). Separate studies indicate that QXs 12a and 12e are also active in vivo as neuroprotectants and also have antinociceptive activity in animal pain models. In terms of in vivo activity, these 5-(N-oxyaza)-7-substituted-QXs are among the most potent broad spectrum ionotropic glutamate antagonists reported.",

However, pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that the half-life of metronidazole is 8-12 h and blood levels at 12 h exceed the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for most anaerobic infections. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of clinical cure among patients who received metronidazole every 12 h compared with those who received an every 8 h frequency. Secondary endpoints included duration of antibiotics, hospital length of stay, escalation of antibiotic therapy, microbiologic cure, and mortality. Methods: This retrospective, single-center, pre-post intervention study of 200 patients between June 2014 to July 2016. Results: No significant differences in clinical cure for every 12 h versus every 8 h metronidazole dosing regimens (85% for both groups, p = 1.00) were found. There were no differences in any of the secondary endpoints, with a mean duration of antibiotic therapy being 5.9 versus 5.8 days and a hospital length of stay averaging 8.1 versus 6.7 days for the 12- and 8-h dosing groups, respectively (p &gt; 0.05). Discussion: Findings validate pharmacokinetic data suggesting that an extended metronidazole dosing interval effectively treats anaerobic infections.",

    "abstract": "There are now four types of opioid receptors. The new designations OP(1), OP(2) and OP(3) correspond, respectively, to the classic delta-, kappa- and micro-nomenclature. OP(4) was previously known as ORL(1), the receptor for the endogenous heptadecapeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ. Although the cellular effects of nociceptin resemble those of conventional OP(1), OP(2), and OP(3) opioid agonists, its effects on nociceptive processes are quite different. Nociceptin produces spinal analgesia but appears to antagonize the effects of opioids. Following the recent synthesis of the nonpeptide OP(4) agonist Ro-64-6198 by Hoffmann-La Roche and the nonpeptide OP(4) antagonist J-113397 by Banyu, the nociceptin-OP(4) system now represents a viable and intriguing new target for drug design. OP(4) agonists may be of use in the management of neuropathic pain, anxiety, anorexia, epilepsy, drug dependence, male impotence, hypertension, cerebral ischemia and neurogenic bladder. They may also serve as novel diuretics and to help to reduce gastrointestinal motility. OP(4) antagonists may be of use as general analgesics and in the improvement of memory function. This review covers the recent exciting progress in this field, compares the actions of OP(4) agonists and antagonists with those of classic opioids, and seeks to predict some of the untoward effects that may be seen with such drugs.",

The uptake of radioactivity in the cerebellum was reduced by unlabeled 7a and mGluR1-selective ligand JNJ-16259685 (2), indicating that [(18)F]7a had in vivo specific binding with mGluR1.

    "abstract": "Danocrine (danazol) is a synthetic steroid with multiple and diverse biologic effects. It exerts these effects by binding to steroid transport proteins in the circulation and to specific receptors in target tissues. Centrally, danazol inhibits gonadotropins, suppressing gametogenesis and steroidogenesis. Gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis are suppressed further through danazol's direct effect on specific enzyme systems. Danazol also displays immunoregulatory effects both in vivo and in vitro. In endometriosis, danazol induces amenorrhea and a hypoestrogenic state, resulting in endometrial atrophy. The drug's direct binding to androgen and progesterone receptors in endometriotic tissue may contribute further to the suppression of endometriosis. In women with endometriosis who produce autoantibodies against endometrial cells and endometrial cell-derived phospholipids, histones and nucleotides, danazol may improve reproductive performance through the suppression of abnormal autoantibody levels. In several other autoimmune and genetic disorders danazol brings about a clinical improvement by lowering abnormal autoantibody production or by increasing the concentration of genetically deficient protein. In order to explore the full clinical potential of the drug and to better understand danazol's mechanism of action and especially its immunoregulatory effects in autoimmune diseases and endometriosis, further investigation is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Due to the broad anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors, it has been proposed that PDE4 inhibitors might be efficacious for skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis. KF66490 is a newly developed PDE4 inhibitor that inhibits PDE4B (IC(50)=220 nM) and the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by mouse peritoneal exudated cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (IC(50)=855 nM). To evaluate efficacy of KF66490 in atopic dermatitis (AD) models, on skin inflammation induced by repeated application of 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene (TNCB) on ear in BALB/c mice and on spontaneously AD-like skin diseases in NC/Nga mice. BALB/c mice were sensitized with 0.3% w/v TNCB applied to the ear on day-7, followed by application three times a week from days 0 to 21. NC/Nga mice spontaneously developed dermatitis symptoms under conventional conditions. Test compounds were administered orally once daily during experiments. In the TNCB-induced dermatitis model, KF66490 significantly inhibited the increase in ear thickness and interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-1beta levels in the ear. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that KF66490 significantly inhibited the proliferation of fibroblasts and CD3-positive T cells infiltration into the ear. In addition, KF66490 significantly suppressed the development of dermatitis in NC/Nga mice on all observation days, except for 5 and 6 weeks after the first dose. Furthermore, KF66490 produced less potent emetic effects than the first generation PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram. The present results suggest that KF66490 has excellent potential as an oral medicine for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.",

    "abstract": "The proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1beta, is known to induce vascular dysfunction and cell death. We investigated the role of IL-1beta and caspase-1 (the enzyme that produces it) in diabetes-induced degeneration of retinal capillaries. Caspase-1 activity is increased in retinas of diabetic and galactosemic mice and diabetic patients. First, we investigated the effect of agents known to inhibit caspase-1 (minocycline and tetracycline) on IL-1beta production and retinal capillary degeneration in diabetic and galactose-fed mice. Second, we examined the effect of genetic deletion of the IL-1beta receptor on diabetes-induced caspase activities and retinal capillary degeneration. Diabetic and galactose-fed mice were injected intraperitoneally with minocycline or tetracycline (5 mg/kg). At 2 months of diabetes, minocycline inhibited hyperglycemia-induced caspase-1 activity and IL-1beta production in the retina. Long-term administration of minocycline prevented retinal capillary degeneration in diabetic (6 months) and galactose-fed (13 months) mice. Tetracycline inhibited hyperglycemia-induced caspase-1 activity in vitro but not in vivo. Mice deficient in the IL-1beta receptor were protected from diabetes-induced caspase activation and retinal pathology at 7 months of diabetes. These results indicate that the caspase-1/IL-1beta signaling pathway plays an important role in diabetes-induced retinal pathology, and its inhibition might represent a new strategy to inhibit capillary degeneration in diabetic retinopathy.",

    "abstract": "ABT-773 is a new 3-keto macrolide antibiotic that has been shown to be very effective against infections by Gram-positive microorganisms. This work examines its inhibitory effects in cells of Streptococcus pneumoniae. ABT-773 caused a proportional decline in cell growth rates and viability with an IC(50) of 5 ng/ml. Protein synthesis in these cells was reduced by 50% at an antibiotic concentration of 2.5 ng/ml. This compound was also found to be a very effective inhibitor of the formation of the 50S ribosomal subunit in growing cells. Pulse and chase labeling assays revealed a reduced rate of 50S synthesis in antibiotic-treated cells. At 2 ng/ml, the rate was reduced to 33% of the control synthesis rate. An IC(50) of 5 ng/ml was found for the effect on this process, indicating an equal effect of the drug on translation and assembly. Synthesis of the 30S ribosomal subunit was unaffected by this antibiotic. The effects of ABT-773 in S. pneumoniae are compared with those of the related ketolide antibiotic telithromycin in S. pneumoniae and in Staphylococcus aureus.",

    "abstract": "Broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors (MMPI) were unsuccessful in cancer clinical trials, partly due to side effects resulting from limited knowledge of the full repertoire of MMP substrates, termed the substrate degradome, and hence the in vivo functions of MMPs. To gain further insight into the degradome of MMP-14 (membrane type 1 MMP) an MMPI, prinomastat (drug code AG3340), was used to reduce proteolytic processing and ectodomain shedding in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transfected with MMP-14. We report a quantitative proteomic evaluation of the targets and effects of the inhibitor in this cell-based system. Proteins in cell-conditioned medium (the secretome) and membrane fractions with levels that were modulated by the MMPI were identified by isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) labeling and tandem mass spectrometry. Comparisons of the expression of MMP-14 with that of a vector control resulted in increased MMP-14/vector ICAT ratios for many proteins in conditioned medium, indicating MMP-14-mediated ectodomain shedding. Following MMPI treatment, the MMPI/vehicle ICAT ratio was reversed, suggesting that MMP-14-mediated shedding of these proteins was blocked by the inhibitor. The reduction in shedding or the release of substrates from pericellular sites in the presence of the MMPI was frequently accompanied by the accumulation of the protein in the plasma membrane, as indicated by high MMPI/vehicle ICAT ratios. Considered together, this is a strong predictor of biologically relevant substrates cleaved in the cellular context that led to the identification of many undescribed MMP-14 substrates, 20 of which we validated biochemically, including DJ-1, galectin-1, Hsp90alpha, pentraxin 3, progranulin, Cyr61, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A, and dickkopf-1. Other proteins with altered levels, such as Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 1 and beta-2-microglobulin, were not substrates in biochemical assays, suggesting an indirect affect of the MMPI, which might be important in drug development as biomarkers or, in preclinical phases, to predict systemic drug actions and adverse side effects. Hence, this approach describes the dynamic pattern of cell membrane ectodomain shedding and its perturbation upon metalloproteinase drug treatment.",

The contractile responses to (-)-noradrenaline were inhibited by low concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants and by higher concentrations of the atypical agents. These results illustrate that, in the preparation, the order of potency of antidepressants as muscarinic and as postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists is similar. The ability of tricyclic, but not atypical agents, to increase the concentration of noradrenaline bound to postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors may be severely limited by the antagonistic effect these agents have at this receptor.",

    "abstract": "The novel atypical antipsychotic ziprasidone has a pharmacologic profile notable for potent agonism of serotonin (5-HT)1A receptors, antagonism at 5-HT1D receptors, and reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine. 5-HT1A receptor agonism, in particular, suggests anxiolytic activity, and ziprasidone has shown preliminary efficacy in treating the symptoms of anxiety associated with psychotic disorders. In this study, the anxiolytic efficacy of ziprasidone was evaluated in nonpsychotic subjects who were anxious before undergoing minor dental surgery. We compared a single oral dose of 20 mg ziprasidone (N = 30) with that of 10 mg diazepam (N = 30) and placebo (N = 30) in a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study. The peak anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone compared with that of placebo was similar to that of diazepam but had a later onset. At 3 hours postdose, the anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone was significantly greater than that of placebo (p &lt; 0.05) and somewhat greater than that of diazepam. Diazepam showed a significantly greater anxiolytic effect than placebo at 1 hour (p &lt; 0.05) but not at 3 hours. The sedative effect of ziprasidone was never greater than that of placebo, whereas that of diazepam was significantly greater than that of placebo 1 to 1.5 hours postdose. Ziprasidone was generally well tolerated. Only one patient reported treatment-related adverse events (nausea and vomiting) and, unlike diazepam, ziprasidone did not cause reductions in blood pressure. Dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, akathisia, and postural hypotension were not seen with ziprasidone. Thus, ziprasidone may possess anxiolytic effects in addition to its antipsychotic properties.",

    "title": "KIF11 inhibition for glioblastoma treatment: reason to hope or a struggle with the brain?",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glioblastomas (GBM) are typically comprised of morphologically diverse cells. Despite current advances in therapy, including surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients with GBM remains poor. Unfortunately, most patients die within 2 years of diagnosis of their disease. Molecular abnormalities vary among individual patients and also within each tumor. Indeed, one of the distinguishing features of GBM is its marked genetic heterogeneity. Due to the brain location of the tumor, the potential target inhibition for anticancer therapy must exhibit a manageable neurotoxicity profile in the concentration range in which the compounds show anti-proliferative activity.Kinesin KIF11 inhibition by small molecules such as Monastrol or Ispinesib is currently under investigation in the field of malignant tumors. In the current study we have assessed the relevance of the anti-mitotic Kinesin-like protein KIF11 in human GBM cell-lines. RESULTS: In this study the target was validated using a set of well characterised and potentially specific small molecule inhibitors of KIF11: an ispinesib analog, Monastrol, a Merck compound and 3 simplified derivatives of the Merck compound. Following an in silico selection, those compounds predicted to bear a favorable BBB permeation profile were assessed for their phenotypic effect on cell lines derived both from primary (U87MG) as well as treated (DBTRG-05-MG) glioblastomas. For some compounds, these data could be compared to their effect on normal human astrocytes, as well as their neurotoxicity on primary rat cortical neurons. The ispinesib analogue 1 showed an anti-proliferative effect on GBM cell lines by blocking them in the G2/M phase in a concentration range which was shown to be harmless to primary rat cortical neurons. Furthermore, ispinesib analog increased caspase 3/7-induced apoptosis in U87MG cells. CONCLUSION: In the area of cell cycle inhibition, KIF11 is critical for proper spindle assembly and represents an attractive anticancer target. Our results suggest that KIF11 inhibitors, when able to permeate the blood-brain-barrier, could represent an interesting class of anticancer drugs with low neurotoxic effects in the treatment of brain tumors.",

    "abstract": "The effects of oxotremorine-M (oxo-M), a muscarinic agonist, on cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in slices of the rat peripheral lung were investigated. Oxo-M stimulated cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 4.2 microM and a maximal effect of 2.4 +/- 0.39-fold over basal. In the presence of forskolin (25 microM), the maximal effect of oxo-M was increased to 14.1 +/- 4.0-fold over basal. Forskolin alone caused a 5.9 +/- 2.2-fold increase in cAMP relative to basal; therefore, the combination of both drugs was more than additive. The effects of oxo-M on cAMP accumulation were unaffected by tetrodotoxin, indicating that the action of oxo-M was not mediated by neuronal release of neurotransmitters. Oxo-M had a small inhibitory effect on cAMP in a homogenate preparation, indicating that the stimulatory response to oxo-M in slices of the lung is not due to direct stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Characterization of the oxo-M potentiation of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation using different muscarinic antagonists yielded calculated pKB values that agreed with binding affinities for the M3 subtype. Oxo-M elicited phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the lung, and the nature of the antagonism of this response was also consistent with that expected for an M3-mediated response. cAMP accumulation in the presence of oxo-M (100 microM), forskolin (12 microM), or both drugs combined was inhibited by indomethacin (1 microM). These results demonstrate that the M3 receptor stimulates cAMP accumulation and phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the rat peripheral lung, and the mechanism for cAMP stimulation may involve arachidonic acid metabolites.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To assess the sensitivity of biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological markers of peripheral norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) function, we chronically antagonized NET by a range of doses of duloxetine [(+)-N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2 thiophenepropanamine], which blocks the NE reuptake process. METHODS AND RESULTS: Duloxetine was administered in a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 15 healthy volunteers. Plasma from duloxetine-treated subjects (ex vivo effect) dose-dependently decreased radioligand binding to human NET (maximum inhibition was 60%) (P=0.02). The dose of intravenous tyramine required to raise systolic blood pressure by 30 mm Hg (PD30) increased dose-dependently with duloxetine and was significant at the end of the 120-mg/d dosage (P&lt;0.001). The plasma dihydoxyphenylglycol to NE (DHPG/NE) ratio was reduced significantly at 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d duloxetine (11.3 at baseline, 3.4 at 240 mg/d, P&lt;0.001). Plasma NE was significantly increased starting at 120 mg/d duloxetine. Urine results (corrected for 24-hour creatinine excretion) showed a dose-dependent change from the baseline urinary excretion for NE, DHPG, and the DHPG/NE ratio. The most sensitive measure, the DHPG/NE ratio, was significant at the 80-mg dose. Urinary NE excretion was significantly raised after 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d duloxetine (P&lt;0.001), the lowest dose used in the study. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the degree of NET blockade can be assessed with the plasma or urine DHPG/NE ratio and the pressor effect of tyramine. Also, the DHPG/NE ratio is more sensitive at the lower end of NET inhibition, whereas tyramine exhibits a linear relation, with NET inhibition commencing at a higher dose.",

    "abstract": "Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were used as a model system to characterize the binding properties of [3H]SK&amp;F 108566, an angiotensin type-1 (AT1) receptor antagonist. The binding was specific, saturable and reversible. The association and dissociation rates of [3H]SK&amp;F 108566 binding to smooth muscle cells were monophasic and Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data yielded a linear plot indicating a homogenous population of binding sites. The maximum binding (Bmax) and apparent dissociation constant (Kd) were 22,000 +/- 6000 sites/cell and 0.83 +/- 0.08nM respectively. The pharmacological specificity of [3H]SK&amp;F 108566 binding to smooth muscle cells is consistent with that observed for AT1 and confirms AT1 receptor specificity of this radioligand. High affinity binding was observed in membranes prepared from bovine adrenal cortex, rat liver and rat kidney glomeruli. COS cells transfected with cDNA encoding human AT1 angiotensin II receptors also displayed high affinity binding site for [3H]SK&amp;F 108566. No specific binding could be detected on membranes prepared from bovine cerebellum, a tissue rich in the angiotensin type-2 (AT2) receptor. These observations indicate that [3H]SK&amp;F 108566 binds to sites which have pharmacological characteristics of angiotensin II AT1 subtype receptors and can be used as a subtype-selective radioligand to characterize AII receptors in various systems.",

    "abstract": "Most antidepressants in clinical use are believed to function by enhancing neurotransmission of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] and/or norepinephrine (NE) via inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake. Agents that affect reuptake of both 5-HT and NE (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) have been postulated to offer greater efficacy for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). These dual-acting agents also display a broader spectrum of action, including efficacy for MDD and associated painful physical symptoms, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia syndrome. Substantial preclinical evidence shows that duloxetine, an approved drug for the treatment of MDD, generalized anxiety disorder, and the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, inhibits reuptake of both 5-HT and NE. This paper reviews clinical and neurochemical evidence of duloxetine's effects on 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition. The clinical evidence supporting duloxetine's effects on NE reuptake inhibition includes indirect measures such as altered excretion of NE metabolites, cardiovascular effects, and treatment-emergent adverse event profiles similar to those for other drugs believed to act through the inhibition of NE reuptake. In summary, the data presented in this report provide clinical evidence of a mechanism for duloxetine involving both 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition in humans and are consistent with preclinical evidence for 5-HT/NE reuptake inhibition.",

    "title": "Clinical review: Prevention and therapy of vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage.",
    "abstract": "Vasospasm is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Radiographic vasospasm usually develops between 5 and 15 days after the initial hemorrhage, and is associated with clinically apparent delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DID) in one-third of patients. The pathophysiology of this reversible vasculopathy is not fully understood but appears to involve structural changes and biochemical alterations at the levels of the vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells. Blood in the subarachnoid space is believed to trigger these changes. In addition, cerebral perfusion may be concurrently impaired by hypovolemia and impaired cerebral autoregulatory function. The combined effects of these processes can lead to reduction in cerebral blood flow so severe as to cause ischemia leading to infarction. Diagnosis is made by some combination of clinical, cerebral angiographic, and transcranial doppler ultrasonographic factors. Nimodipine, a calcium channel antagonist, is so far the only available therapy with proven benefit for reducing the impact of DID. Aggressive therapy combining hemodynamic augmentation, transluminal balloon angioplasty, and intra-arterial infusion of vasodilator drugs is, to varying degrees, usually implemented. A panoply of drugs, with different mechanisms of action, has been studied in SAH related vasospasm. Currently, the most promising are magnesium sulfate, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, nitric oxide donors and endothelin-1 antagonists. This paper reviews established and emerging therapies for vasospasm.",

In human plasma, MR-33 inhibited not only the procoagulant activity of thrombin, but also the thrombin generation via accelerating the thrombin-catalyzed protein C activation. In rat disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) models, intravenous infusion of MR-33 improved the hematological abnormalities without excessive prolongation of APTT and bleeding time. Benefit (dose required for 50% inhibition of fibrinogen decrease: ED50) to risk (minimum dose required for significant prolongation of bleeding time) ratio was 1:27 for MR-33. Furthermore, the anticoagulant activities of MR-33 was independent of AT III activity, and MR-33 was effective on heparin-resistant DIC models with low AT III level in rats. Intravenous injection of MR-33 prevented the endotoxin-induced increases in TAT, TNF-alpha and IL-6 level and pulmonary vascular permeability in mice. These results indicate that MR-33 may be a clinically useful antithrombotic agent with reduced risk for hemorrhage, and this drug also has anti-inflammatory effects.

    "abstract": "Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition by a selective inhibitor valeryl salicylate, or nonselective inhibitors at 10 mg/kg, including aspirin, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and picroxicam, attenuated by 29%-46% the duration of loss of righting reflex induced by diazepam (20 mg/kg) in mice. On the other hand, arachidonic acid (20 mg/kg) increased the duration of diazepam-induced loss of righting reflex by 48%. This effect of arachidonic acid was abolished by aspirin. However, aspirin at 10 mg/kg also did not alter the effects of diazepam (5 mg/kg) on spontaneous activity and rotarod performance. These findings strongly suggest that one or more COX products, most likely prostaglandins, play a significant role in modulating the hypnotic effect of diazepam. Elucidating the mechanism involved may further our understanding of the pharmacology of benzodiazepines.",

    "abstract": "Drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine (AMPH), and heroin, elevate extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the brain, thereby altering the activity/plasticity of reward circuits and precipitating addiction. The physiological release of DA occurs through the calcium-dependent fusion of a synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane. Extracellular DA is cleared by uptake through the Na+/Cl- -dependent DA transporter (DAT). In contrast, the substrate AMPH induces nonvesicular release of DA mediated by DAT. Extracellular AMPH is generally believed to trigger DA efflux through DAT by facilitating exchange for cytosolic DA. Here, in outside-out patches from heterologous cells stably expressing DAT or from dopaminergic neurons, by using ionic conditions in the patch pipette that mimic those produced by AMPH stimulation, we report that AMPH causes DAT-mediated DA efflux by two independent mechanisms: (i) a slow process consistent with an exchange mechanism and (ii) a process that results in rapid (millisecond) bursts of DA efflux through a channel-like mode of DAT. Because channel-like release of DA induced by AMPH is rapid and contains a large number of DA molecules, with a single burst of DA on par with a quantum of DA from exocytotic release of a vesicle, this burst mode of release may play a role in the synaptic actions and psychostimulant properties of AMPH and related compounds. Unlike AMPH, the endogenous substrate DA, when present on both sides of the plasma membrane, inhibits this channel-like activity, thereby suggesting that the DAT channel-like mode cannot accumulate DA against a concentration gradient.",

METHODS: Amrinone was infused at a rate of 20 or 100 microg/kg/min, and 60-min partial ischemia was induced. The effects of amrinone on hemodynamic status, hepatic tissue cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate (cAMP), hepatic tissue blood flow, platelet aggregation and plasma levels of transaminase were examined. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and myeloperoxidase activity were analyzed and histological examination was performed in the injured liver. The cumulative survival rates for 14 days were also examined. RESULTS: Hemodynamic status was not affected by amrinone. The levels of cAMP during reperfusion were significantly higher in rats with amrinone. Hepatic tissue blood flow during reperfusion was increased and platelet aggregation was inhibited by amrinone. The expression of ICAM-1 mRNA and protein in the injured liver was suppressed in rats with amrinone. The levels of transaminase, necrotic changes and myeloperoxidase activity were suppressed after reperfusion and higher survival was achieved in the rats treated with amrinone. CONCLUSIONS: Amrinone protected against ischemia-reperfusion injury of the liver in the present model.",

The potency of the quinolones as DNA gyrase inhibitors did not always correlate with antimicrobial potency. For example, OFL was a less potent inhibitor of gyrase than rosoxacin, yet the MIC of OFL was 16-fold lower than that of rosoxacin. Similarly, the MICs of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin (the most potent of the antibiotics tested in these assays) were several hundredfold lower than the MIC of nalidixic acid (the least potent of these antibiotics), but the inhibition of purified gyrase by these two quinolones was only 8- to 16-fold lower than that of nalidixic acid. These results suggest that factors in addition to inhibition of gyrase supercoiling activity are important in determining the potency of these drugs. Further studies indicated that the uptake of norfloxacin, OFL, and amifloxacin by M. luteus cells may not account for the large differences in MICs observed for these drugs (MICs of 0.8, 2.0, and 128 micrograms/ml, respectively).",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The potential of gemcitabine to interact with carboplatin was explored in a phase II trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were sampled after drug administration to measure DNA interstrand cross-link formation and repair. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients received carboplatin target area under concentration-time curve (AUC 4) followed by gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) with a second dose of gemcitabine on day 8. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained in 12 patients before and at intervals during the first cycle of chemotherapy. DNA cross-link formation and repair (unhooking) were measured by the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay following ex vivo incubation. RESULTS: The global response rate was 47% (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors rate, 29%; CA125 rate, 63%). Delays in treatment were seen in 24% of cycles largely due to myelosuppression; 15% of day 8 administration was omitted. Peak carboplatin-induced DNA cross-linking was seen by 24 hours. Significant reduction was seen in the repair of in vivo carboplatin-induced DNA cross-links following administration of gemcitabine. CONCLUSION: An enhanced activity of carboplatin in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer may be due to synergy with gemcitabine through inhibition of repair of DNA cross-links. Future studies should explore coadministration of these drugs, as this may be a more effective schedule.",

    "abstract": "The paramagnetic iron at the active site of highly purified, catalytically active phenylalanine hydroxylase was studied by EPR at 3.6 K and one-dimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy at 293 K. The EPR-detectable iron of the bovine enzyme was found to be present as a high-spin form (S = 5/2) in different ligand field symmetries depending on medium conditions (buffer ions) and the presence of ligands known to bind at the active site. At 3.6 K and in phosphate buffer, the paramagnetic iron is coordinated in an environment of rhombic symmetry (g = 4.3), whereas Tris buffer favours an environment of axial ligand field symmetry (g = 6.7, 5.3 and 2.0). The latter axial type of signals resembles those observed at g = 7.0, 5.2 and 1.9 for the enzyme in phosphate buffer when L-noradrenaline is added as an active-site ligand (inhibitor). The same proportion of iron that coordinates to L-noradrenaline seems to be reduced by the pterin cofactor and participate in catalysis. Experimental evidence is presented that Tris inhibits the enzyme by interacting with the enzyme-bound ferric iron and decreases its rate of reduction by the tetrahydropterin cofactor. Preincubation with dithiothreitol also inhibits the enzyme activity and prevents the reduction of its catalytically active ferric iron by pterin cofactors as well as binding of catecholamines to the enzyme. 1H-NMR spectroscopy revealed that the substrate (L-phenylalanine) and L-noradrenaline bind close to the paramagnetic iron, and that the catecholamine displaces the substrate from its binding at the active site. The results support our recently proposed model for the cooperative binding of inhibitor and substrate at the active site [Martinez, A. et al. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 193, 211-219].",

Clozapine (0.03-3.0 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in responding on the clozapine-associated lever with full substitution at the training dose in all monkeys. Dose-related increases in responding on the clozapine-associated lever and full substitution also were observed with structural analogues of clozapine including perlapine and fluperlapine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg), seroquel (0.1-5.6 mg/kg), and JL 5, JL 8 and JL 18 (0.1-3.0 mg/kg). Other clozapine analogues, including olanzapine, amoxapine, loxapine and clothiapine, and conventional antipsychotic drugs, including phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine, produced some clozapine-associated responding up to the highest doses that could be studied, but did not substitute for clozapine. Olanzapine did produce full clozapine-lever responding following pretreatment with the dopamine D2-receptor agonist (+)-PHNO (0.003-0.01 mg/kg). Putatively atypical antipsychotics that are structurally unrelated to clozapine including risperidone (0.003-0.1 mg/kg), sertindole (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) and remoxipride (0.1-5.6 mg/kg) similarly failed to substitute for clozapine up to the highest doses. The present results indicate that some, but not all, structural analogs of clozapine have clozapine-like discriminative-stimulus effects and that novel antipsychotic drugs which purportedly have clozapine-like clinical efficacy may not produce its interoceptive stimulus effects.",

Later that decade there appeared additional encouraging reports of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, immunotoxins, and other antibodies with antitumor effects against lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies as a treatment of malignancy became reality in late 1997 when the US Food and Drug Administration approved the anti-CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody rituximab for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. Since that time an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (dacliximab) and an anti-CD25 immunotoxin fusion product (denileukin diftitox) have become clinically available. Several radio- labeled antibodies, including the murine anti-CD20 products (131)I-tositumomab and (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, are in advanced stages of clinical testing as are other unlabeled monoclonal antibodies with antilymphoma activity. Other antilymphoma immunotoxins that react with CD25, CD19, and CD22 also have shown promise. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The therapeutic arsenal against lymphoma has been significantly changed by the addition of these antibody products that are active as single agents, and are synergistic, additive, or both with other antilymphoma treatments.",

    "title": "Structural basis for selectivity of a small molecule, S1-binding, submicromolar inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a protease associated with tumor metastasis and invasion. Inhibitors of uPA may have potential as drugs for prostate, breast and other cancers. Therapeutically useful inhibitors must be selective for uPA and not appreciably inhibit the related, and structurally and functionally similar enzyme, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), involved in the vital blood-clotting cascade. RESULTS: We produced mutagenically deglycosylated low molecular weight uPA and determined the crystal structure of its complex with 4-iodobenzo[b]thiophene 2-carboxamidine (K(i) = 0.21 +/- 0.02 microM). To probe the structural determinants of the affinity and selectivity of this inhibitor for uPA we also determined the structures of its trypsin and thrombin complexes, of apo-trypsin, apo-thrombin and apo-factor Xa, and of uPA, trypsin and thrombin bound by compounds that are less effective uPA inhibitors, benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamidine, thieno[2,3-b]-pyridine-2-carboxamidine and benzamidine. The K(i) values of each inhibitor toward uPA, tPA, trypsin, tryptase, thrombin and factor Xa were determined and compared. One selectivity determinant of the benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamidines for uPA involves a hydrogen bond at the S1 site to Ogamma(Ser190) that is absent in the Ala190 proteases, tPA, thrombin and factor Xa. Other subtle differences in the architecture of the S1 site also influence inhibitor affinity and enzyme-bound structure. CONCLUSIONS: Subtle structural differences in the S1 site of uPA compared with that of related proteases, which result in part from the presence of a serine residue at position 190, account for the selectivity of small thiophene-2-carboxamidines for uPA, and afford a framework for structure-based design of small, potent, selective uPA inhibitors.",

    "title": "Hypertension: renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system alterations.",
    "abstract": "Blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), that is, renin inhibitors, angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Ang II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, are a cornerstone in the treatment of hypertension. How exactly they exert their effect, in particular in patients with low circulating RAAS activity, also taking into consideration the so-called Ang II/aldosterone escape that often occurs after initial blockade, is still incompletely understood. Multiple studies have tried to find parameters that predict the response to RAAS blockade, allowing a personalized treatment approach. Consequently, the question should now be answered on what basis (eg, sex, ethnicity, age, salt intake, baseline renin, ACE or aldosterone, and genetic variance) a RAAS blocker can be chosen to treat an individual patient. Are all blockers equal? Does optimal blockade imply maximum RAAS blockade, for example, by combining &gt;=2 RAAS blockers or by simply increasing the dose of 1 blocker? Exciting recent investigations reveal a range of unanticipated extrarenal effects of aldosterone, as well as a detailed insight in the genetic causes of primary aldosteronism, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers have now become an important treatment option for resistant hypertension. Finally, apart from the deleterious ACE-Ang II-Ang II type 1 receptor arm, animal studies support the existence of protective aminopeptidase A-Ang III-Ang II type 2 receptor and ACE2-Ang-(1 to 7)-Mas receptor arms, paving the way for multiple new treatment options. This review provides an update about all these aspects, critically discussing the many controversies and allowing the reader to obtain a full understanding of what we currently know about RAAS alterations in hypertension.",

    "abstract": "The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) plays an important role in cognitive processes and may represent a drug target for treating cognitive deficits in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. In the present study, we used a novel alpha7 nAChR-selective agonist, 2-methyl-5-(6-phenyl-pyridazin-3-yl)-octahydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (A-582941) to interrogate cognitive efficacy, as well as examine potential cellular mechanisms of cognition. Exhibiting high affinity to native rat (Ki = 10.8 nM) and human (Ki = 16.7 nM) alpha7 nAChRs, A-582941 enhanced cognitive performance in behavioral assays including the monkey delayed matching-to-sample, rat social recognition, and mouse inhibitory avoidance models that capture domains of working memory, short-term recognition memory, and long-term memory consolidation, respectively. In addition, A-582941 normalized sensory gating deficits induced by the alpha7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine in rats, and in DBA/2 mice that exhibit a natural sensory gating deficit. Examination of signaling pathways known to be involved in cognitive function revealed that alpha7 nAChR agonism increased extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in PC12 cells. Furthermore, increases in ERK1/2 and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation were observed in mouse cingulate cortex and/or hippocampus after acute A-582941 administration producing plasma concentrations in the range of alpha7 binding affinities and behavioral efficacious doses. The MEK inhibitor SL327 completely blocked alpha7 agonist-evoked ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that alpha7 nAChR agonism can lead to broad-spectrum efficacy in animal models at doses that enhance ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation/activation and may represent a mechanism that offers potential to improve cognitive deficits associated with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Paroxetine is a potent and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with some neuropharmacologic properties unique among this class of compounds. The findings of early in vitro studies demonstrated the potency of paroxetine at inhibiting 5-HT uptake in rat synaptosomes. Paroxetine also has been shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of the human serotonin transporter (SERT) and has recently been demonstrated to have moderate affinity for the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Because of the affinity and in vitro selectivity of this SSRI, tritiated paroxetine is now widely used as a marker for SERT in laboratory settings, and its use has advanced our understanding of neurotransmitter function in the brain and periphery. The in vivo pharmacologic properties of paroxetine are well characterized, especially following acute administration. However, the pharmacologic effects of chronically administered paroxetine remain an active area of study. Paroxetine administration in laboratory animals has been shown to be associated with decreased SERT density and function, maintenance of normal firing rates and release of 5-HT, and increased activation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. Using a novel ex vivo assay, we have demonstrated that paroxetine exhibits dose-related inhibition of the NET in patients treated for depression. At usual clinical doses (ie, 20 mg/d), paroxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of the SERT; however, at higher doses (ie, 40 mg/d), paroxetine can exhibit marked NET inhibition. The application of these findings of in vivo NET inhibition by paroxetine in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders will be informed by further clinical studies.",

In particular, improved treatment of the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia which greatly impact overall morbidity is needed. In this review we will briefly discuss the current pipeline of drugs for schizophrenia, outlining many of the strategies and targets currently under investigation for the development of new schizophrenia drugs. Many of these compounds have great potential as augmenting agents in the treatment of negative symptoms and cognition. In addition, we will highlight the importance of developing new paradigms for drug discovery in schizophrenia and call for an increased role of academic scientists in discovering and validating novel drug targets. Indeed, recent breakthroughs in genetic studies of schizophrenia are allowing for the development of hypothesis-driven approaches for discovering possible disease-modifying drugs for schizophrenia. Thus, this is an exciting and pivotal time for the development of truly novel approaches to drug development and treatment of complex disorders like schizophrenia.",

This study employed positron emission tomography (PET) to assess the extent and duration of DAT receptor occupancy by bupropion and its metabolites under conditions of steady-state oral dosing with bupropion sustained-release (SR) in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Six healthy male volunteers received bupropion SR 150 mg daily on days 1 through 3 and 150 mg every 12 hours on day 4 through the morning of day 11. PET investigations were performed between 1 and 7 days before initiation of bupropion SR dosing, as well as 3, 12, and 24 hours after the last dose of bupropion SR on day 11. RESULTS: Bupropion and its metabolites inhibited striatal uptake of the selective DAT-binding radioligand (11)C-betaCIT-FE in vivo. Three hours after the last dose of bupropion SR, average DAT occupancy by bupropion and its metabolites was 26%-a level that was maintained through the last PET assessment at 24 hours after dosing. CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion and its metabolites induced a low occupancy of the striatal DAT over 24 hours under conditions of steady-state oral dosing with therapeutic doses of bupropion SR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that dopamine reuptake inhibition may be responsible in part for the therapeutic effects of the drug.",

Meso-2,3-DMSA and DMPS are biotransformed differently in humans. More than 90% of the DMSA excreted in the urine is found in the form of a mixed disulfide in which each of the sulfur atoms of DMSA is in disulfide linkage with an L-cysteine molecule. After DMPS administration, however, acyclic and cyclic disulfides of DMPS are found in the urine. The Dimaval-mercury challenge test holds great promise as a diagnostic test for mercury exposure, especially for low level mercurialism. Urinary mercury after Dimaval challenge may be a better biomarker of low level mercurialism than unchallenged urinary mercury excretion.",

    "abstract": "Bioassay-guided fractionation of the MeOH extract of the whole plant of Geum japonicum led to the isolation of seven known tannins. They were identified by spectroscopic methods as penta-O-galloyl-beta-glucoside (1), pedunculagin (2), 2, 3-(S)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-D-glucose (3), tellimagrandin II (4), 2, 6-di-O-galloyl-D-glucose (5), casuariin (6), and 5-desgalloylstachyurin (7). Compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 showed potent anticoagulant activity by significantly prolonging the clotting of rabbit plasma. The inhibitory effect of 2 was competitively directed against thrombin. Its IC50 values for inhibition of the enzymatic activity of thrombin on synthetic substrate and fibrinogen were 0.18 and 0.15 microM, respectively. On the other hand, compounds 1, 4, 6, and 7 are mixed noncompetitive inhibitors of thrombin. Their IC50 values for inhibition of fibrinogen hydrolysis were twofold to sevenfold lower than those for the inhibition of synthetic substrate hydrolysis. Factor Xa was competitively inhibited by compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. The phenolic hydroxyl groups of the active tannins appear to play an important role in their inhibitory effect on the enzymes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The histamine H3 receptor antagonist radioligand [3H]-A-349821 was characterized as a radiotracer for assessing in vivo receptor occupancy by H3 receptor antagonists that affect behaviour. This model was established as an alternative to ex vivo binding methods, for relating antagonist H3 receptor occupancy to blood levels and efficacy in preclinical models. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In vivo cerebral cortical H3 receptor occupancy by [3H]-A-349821 was determined in rats from differences in [3H]-A-349821 levels in the isolated cortex and cerebellum, a brain region with low levels of H3 receptors. Comparisons were made to relate antagonist H3 receptor occupancy to blood levels and efficacy in a preclinical model of cognition, the five-trial inhibitory avoidance response in rat pups. KEY RESULTS: In adult rats, [3H]-A-349821, 1.5 microg x kg(-1), penetrated into the brain and cleared more rapidly from cerebellum than cortex; optimally, [3H]-A-349821 levels were twofold higher in the latter. With increasing [3H]-A-349821 doses, cortical H3 receptor occupancy was saturable with a binding capacity consistent with in vitro binding in cortex membranes. In studies using tracer [3H]-A-349821 doses, ABT-239 and other H3 receptor antagonists inhibited H3 receptor occupancy by [3H]-A-349821 in a dose-dependent manner. Blood levels of the antagonists corresponding to H3 receptor occupancy were consistent with blood levels associated with efficacy in the five-trial inhibitory avoidance response. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: When employed as an occupancy radiotracer, [3H]-A-349821 provided valid measurements of in vivo H3 receptor occupancy, which may be helpful in guiding and interpreting clinical studies of H3 receptor antagonists.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We have previously found that agents increasing intracellular cAMP levels of smooth muscles, such as PDE3 inhibitors, aminophylline and prostaglandin E1, produce both bronchodilation and pulmonary vasodilation in serotonin-induced pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction models. In the present study we have simultaneously evaluated the spasmolytic effects of colforsin daropate, a novel forskolin derivative, on serotonin-induced pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction. METHODS: Ten mongrel dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital. The pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction were elicited with serotonin (10 microg/kg + 1 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) and assessed as percentage changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and bronchial cross-sectional area (BCA) (basal = 100%). Initially, the relaxant effects of colforsin daropate (0-300 microg/kg) were determined. The PVR and BCA were assessed before and 30 min after serotonin infusion began and 5 min after each dose of colforsin daropate. To determine whether colforsin daropate-induced relaxation is independent of plasma catecholamine, propranolol 0.4 mg/kg was given following colforsin daropate 300 microg/kg i.v. RESULTS: Colforsin daropate reversed both pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction dose-dependently: -logED50 (95% confidence intervals, mean ED50) for pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction 5.44 (5.08-5.80, 3.6 microg/kg) and 4.90 (4.06-5.20, 12.5 microg/kg), respectively. However, colforsin daropate (&gt;or= 30 microg/kg) produced a more pronounced systemic than pulmonary vasodilation. Although colforsin daropate (&gt;or= 30 microg/kg) significantly increased plasma catecholamines, propranolol did not reverse the relaxant effects. CONCLUSIONS: Colforsin daropate may attenuate bronchoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension. In addition, as beta-blockade did not change the attenuation, the relaxant effects may be independent of plasma catecholamines.",

    "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major, biologically active, but psycho-inactive component of cannabis. In this cell culture-based report, CBD is shown to displace the agonist, [3H]8-OH-DPAT from the cloned human 5-HT1a receptor in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the major psychoactive component of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) does not displace agonist from the receptor in the same micromolar concentration range. In signal transduction studies, CBD acts as an agonist at the human 5-HT1a receptor as demonstrated in two related approaches. First, CBD increases [35S]GTPgammaS binding in this G protein coupled receptor system, as does the known agonist serotonin. Second, in this GPCR system, that is negatively coupled to cAMP production, both CBD and 5-HT decrease cAMP concentration at similar apparent levels of receptor occupancy, based upon displacement data. Preliminary comparative data is also presented from the cloned rat 5-HT2a receptor suggesting that CBD is active, but less so, relative to the human 5-HT1a receptor, in binding analyses. Overall, these studies demonstrate that CBD is a modest affinity agonist at the human 5-HT1a receptor. Additional work is required to compare CBD's potential at other serotonin receptors and in other species. Finally, the results indicate that cannabidiol may have interesting and useful potential beyond the realm of cannabinoid receptors.",

Previously, high-voltage activated N-type calcium channel inhibition has been implicated in the analgesic effect of BAB. In the present study we show that low-voltage activated or T-type calcium channels may also contribute to this effect. Typical transient T-type barium currents, selectively evoked by low-voltage (-40 mV) clamp stimulation of small (approximately 20 microm diameter) dorsal root ganglion neurons from newborn mice, were inhibited by BAB with an IC50 value of approximately 200 microM. Furthermore, 200 microM BAB accelerated T-type current activation, deactivation, and inactivation kinetics, comparable to earlier observations for N-type calcium channels. Finally, 200 microM BAB had no effect on the midpoint potential and slope factor of the activation curve, although it caused a approximately 3 mV hyperpolarizing shift of the inactivation curve, without affecting the slope factor. We conclude that BAB inhibits T-type calcium channels with a mechanism associated with channel kinetics acceleration.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: After considering the effects of 5-HT receptor agonists with different binding profiles on the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Zohar and Kindler hypothesized that the 5-HT(1D) receptor was implicated in this disorder's pathophysiology. METHODS: We explored the 5-HT(1D) hypothesis in a 5-day, random, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral sumatriptan 100 mg/day in medication-free adults with OCD. We hypothesized that sumatriptan, a 5-HT(1D) agonist, would diminish 5-HT release, thereby worsening OCD symptoms. We further hypothesized that by beginning to desensitize 5-HT(1D) receptors, sumatriptan pretreatment would promote a faster response or an increased likelihood of response to subsequent treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. RESULTS: The five sumatriptan subjects' OCD symptom worsening, as measured by the Yale-Brown scale ( upward arrow 17.6% (S.D. 14.6)), was significant when compared to the slight symptom decrease in the five placebo subjects ( downward arrow 5.2% (S.D. 4.9), P&lt;0.015). The sumatriptan group did not exhibit a faster response or greater likelihood of response to a 90-day, open label trial of paroxetine. CONCLUSIONS: Longer term studies of the effects of 5-HT(1D) agonists on OCD symptoms are indicated. Zolmitriptan, a potent 5-HT(1D) receptor agonist with better penetration of the blood-brain barrier, may be a preferred challenge agent.",

    "abstract": "Leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) is a product of eicosanoid metabolism and acts as an extremely potent chemotactic mediator for inflammation. LTB(4) exerts positive effects on the immigration and activation of leukocytes. These effects suggest an involvement of LTB(4) in several diseases: inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, arthritis, and asthma. LTB(4) elicits actions through interaction with one or more cell surface receptors that lead to chemotaxis and inflammation. One leukotriene B(4) receptor has been recently identified (LTB(4)-R1). In this report we describe cloning of a cDNA encoding a novel 358-amino acid receptor (LTB(4)-R2) that possesses seven membrane-spanning domains and is homologous (42%) and genetically linked to LTB(4)-R1. Expression of LTB(4)-R2 is broad but highest in liver, intestine, spleen, and kidney. In radioligand binding assays, membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with LTB(4)-R2 cDNA displayed high affinity (K(d) = 0.17 nm) for [(3)H]LTB(4). Radioligand competition assays revealed high affinities of the receptor for LTB(4) and LTB(5), and 20-hydroxy-LTB(4), and intermediate affinities for 15(S)-HETE and 12-oxo-ETE. Three LTB(4) receptor antagonists, 14,15-dehydro-LTB(4), LTB(4)-3-aminopropylamide, and U-75302, had high affinity for LTB(4)-R1 but not for LTB(4)-R2. No apparent affinity binding for the receptors was detected for the CysLT1-selective antagonists montelukast and zafirlukast. LTB(4) functionally mobilized intracellular calcium and inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in 293 cells. The discovery of this new receptor should aid in further understanding the roles of LTB(4) in pathologies in these tissues and may provide a tool in identification of specific antagonists/agonists for potential therapeutic treatments.",

The purpose of this study was to characterize methotrexate transport, as well as to determine the site and the mechanism of drug interactions in the proximal tubule. Mouse proximal tubule cells stably expressing basolateral human organic anion transporters (hOAT1 and hOAT3) and apical hOAT (hOAT4) were established. The K(m) values for hOAT1-, hOAT3-, and hOAT4-mediated methotrexate uptake were 553.8 microM, 21.1 microM, and 17.8 microM, respectively. NSAIDs (salicylate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, phenylbutazone, piroxicam, and indomethacin), probenecid, and penicillin G dose dependently inhibited methotrexate uptake mediated by hOAT1, hOAT3, and hOAT4. Kinetic analysis of inhibitory effects of these drugs on hOAT3-mediated methotrexate uptake revealed that these inhibitions were competitive. The K(i) values for the effects of salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, and probenecid on hOAT3-mediated methotrexate uptake were comparable with therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations of unbound drugs. In addition, in the presence of human serum albumin, the K(i) values were comparable with therapeutically relevant total plasma concentrations of drugs. In conclusion, these results suggest that methotrexate is taken up via hOAT3 and hOAT1 at the basolateral side of the proximal tubule and effluxed or taken up at the apical side via hOAT4. In addition, hOAT1, hOAT3, and hOAT4 are the sites of drug interactions between methotrexate and NSAIDs, probenecid, and penicillin G. Furthermore, it was predicted that hOAT3 is the site of drug interactions between methotrexate and salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, and probenecid in vivo.",

To analyze the ErbB2 side of the interface, we have mutated a number of residues contacting pertuzumab and examined the effects of these mutations on pertuzumab binding and ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimerization.

    "abstract": "Aryl and heteroaryl sulfonamides (ArSO(2)NH(2)) are therapeutically used to inhibit the catalytic activity of carbonic anhydrases (CAs). Using a \"click-tail\" approach a novel class of glycoconjugate benzene sulfonamides have been synthesized that contain diverse carbohydrate-triazole tails. These compounds were assessed for their ability to inhibit three human CA isozymes in vitro: cytosolic hCA I and hCA II and transmembrane, tumor-associated hCA IX. This isozyme has a minimal expression in normal tissue but is overexpressed in hypoxic tumors and its inhibition is a current approach toward new cancer therapies. The qualitative structure-activity for all derivatives demonstrated that the stereochemical diversity present within the carbohydrate tails effectively interrogated the CA active site topology, to generate several inhibitors that were potent and selective toward hCA IX, an important outcome in the quest for potential cancer therapy applications based on CA inhibition.",

Management of patients with relapsed B-ALL, a group characterized by dismal outcomes, poses a clinical challenge. To address this unmet need, novel therapeutics are being investigated in the setting of relapsed B-ALL with encouraging results. CD22 is an important B-cell antigen expressed in 80-90% of B-ALL cases. CD22 undergoes constitutive endocytosis with antibody ligation, making it an attractive biologic target for immunoconjugates. Inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO), a CD22-targeted antibody-drug conjugate demonstrated impressive single agent activity even among heavily pretreated relapsed B-ALL patients. A recent randomized phase III clinical trial demonstrates superiority of IO over standard of care chemotherapy as first- or second-line salvage therapy for relapsed B-ALL. In this review, we summarize the preclinical and clinical data available to date using IO in relapsed B-ALL.",

    "title": "Thromboxane A2 inhibition: therapeutic potential in bronchial asthma.",
    "abstract": "Bronchial asthma is a disease defined by reversible airway obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. In addition to histamine and acetylcholine, recent studies have emphasized the role of arachidonic acid metabolites (leukotrienes, prostaglandins and thromboxane A(2)) in the pathogenesis of asthma. Among these mediators, thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) has attracted attention as an important mediator in the pathophysiology of asthma because of its potent bronchoconstrictive activity. Thromboxane A(2) is believed to be involved not only in late asthmatic responses but also in bronchial hyperresponsiveness, a typical feature of asthma. Strategies for inhibition of TXA(2) include TXA(2) receptor antagonism and thromboxane synthase inhibition. Results of double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials have proven the efficacies of the thromboxane receptor antagonist seratrodast and the thromboxane synthase inhibitor ozagrel in the treatment of patients with asthma. Seratrodast and ozagrel are available in Japan for the treatment of asthma. Ramatroban, another thromboxane receptor antagonist, is currently under phase III clinical evaluation in Europe and Japan for the treatment of asthma. The pharmacological profiles of the thromboxane modulators may be improved by combination with leukotriene D(4) receptor antagonists. A multi-pathway inhibitory agent such as YM 158, which is a novel orally active dual antagonist for leukotriene D(4) and thromboxane A(2 )receptors, may have potent therapeutic effects in the treatment of bronchial asthma. Large scale clinical trials are necessary to further define the role of thromboxane modulators in the treatment of patients with asthma.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor, rofecoxib in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. METHODS: Rofecoxib, 25 mg or 125 mg once daily, was compared with placebo in a 6 week, double blind, parallel group, randomized, multicenter study of 219 patients with knee OA. RESULTS: Both doses of rofecoxib produced clinically significant improvement as assessed by primary (e.g., WOMAC Pain Subscale 0-100 mm, decrease from baseline: placebo: 7.1 mm; rofecoxib 25 mg: 28.1 mm, rofecoxib 125 mg: 28.0 mm; p &lt; 0.001 rofecoxib vs placebo) and secondary efficacy (p &lt; 0.05) criteria compared with placebo. Clinical improvement with the 25 mg dose was similar to that with the 125 mg dose. Both rofecoxib doses were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Specific inhibition of COX-2 by 25 and 125 mg rofecoxib, administered once daily, resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in patients with OA. This study confirms that COX-2 derived prostanoids are important clinical mediators of pain and other symptoms of knee OA and that inhibition of COX-1 is not required to provide clinical benefit.",

    "abstract": "Ribonucleosides inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication by mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report the antiviral mechanism for the ribonucleoside analog 5-azacytidine (5-AZC). We hypothesized that the anti-HIV-1 activity of 5-AZC was due to an increase in the HIV-1 mutation rate following its incorporation into viral RNA during transcription. However, we demonstrate that 5-AZC's primary antiviral activity can be attributed to its effect on the early phase of HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, the antiviral activity was associated with an increase in the frequency of viral mutants, suggesting that 5-AZC's primary target is reverse transcription. Sequencing analysis showed an enrichment in G-to-C transversion mutations and further supports the idea that reverse transcription is an antiviral target of 5-AZC. These results indicate that 5-AZC is incorporated into viral DNA following reduction to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Incorporation into the viral DNA leads to an increase in mutant frequency that is consistent with lethal mutagenesis during reverse transcription as the primary antiviral mechanism of 5-AZC. Antiviral activity and increased mutation frequency were also associated with the late phase of HIV-1 replication; however, 5-AZC's effect on the late phase was less robust. These results reveal that the primary antiviral mechanism of 5-AZC can be attributed to its ability to increase the HIV-1 mutation frequency through viral-DNA incorporation during reverse transcription. Our observations indicate that 5-AZC can affect two steps in HIV-1 replication (i.e., transcription and reverse transcription) but that its primary antiviral activity is due to incorporation during reverse transcription.",

Because minocycline inhibits matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), we also compared minocycline's protective effect in wild type (wt) and MMP-9 knock-out (ko) mice. Wt FVB/N, Balb/C, and two lines of MMP-9 ko and their wt C57Bl/6 control mice were subjected to 24- or 72-hour permanent MCAO. Drug administration was started either 12 hours before or 2 hours after the onset of MCAO. Infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium staining or T2-weighted MRI. Zymography was used to study the expression of MMPs. In wt strains, tetracycline treatments started before MCAO reduced the infarct size by 25% to 50%, whereas the treatment started after MCAO was not protective. Minocycline inhibited ischemia-provoked pro-MMP-9 induction in wt mice, but was not protective in MMP-9 ko mice. Pro-MMP-2 was induced by MCAO in wt and MMP-9 ko mice. MCAO-induced pro-MMP-2 was downregulated by minocycline treatment in wt mice but remained in MMP-9 ko mice at the same level as in saline-treated wt mice. Tetracyclines are protective in permanent MCAO when the treatment is started before the insult. Minocycline may provide protection by interfering with MMPs.",

Antagonists were also identified. A linear correlation between binding affinity for C3aR and calculated hydrogen-bond interaction energy of the heteroatom indicated that its hydrogen-bonding capacity influenced ligand affinity and function mediated by C3aR. Hydrogen-bond accepting heterocycles (e.g., imidazole) conferred the highest affinity and agonist potency (e.g., 21, EC50 24 nM, Ca(2+), HMDM) with comparable efficacy and immunostimulatory activity as that of C3a in activating human macrophages (Ca(2+), IL1beta, TNFalpha, CCL3).

    "abstract": "Bryostatin-1 (bryostatin) is a macrocyclic lactone derived from Bugula neritina, a marine bryozoan. On the basis of the strength of in vitro and animal studies, bryostatin is being investigated as a possible treatment for a variety of human malignancies. Severe myalgias are a common dose-limiting side effect. Because cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived prostaglandins can cause pain, we investigated whether bryostatin induced COX-2. Bryostatin (1-10 nM) induced COX-2 mRNA, COX-2 protein, and prostaglandin biosynthesis. These effects were observed in macrophages as well as in a series of human cancer cell lines. Transient transfections localized the stimulatory effects of bryostatin to the cyclic AMP response element of the COX-2 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift experiments revealed a marked increase in the binding of activator protein-1 (AP-1)(c-Jun/c-Fos) to the cyclic AMP response element of the COX-2 promoter. Pharmacological and transient transfection studies indicated that bryostatin stimulated COX-2 transcription via the protein kinase C--&gt;mitogen-activated protein kinase--&gt;AP-1 pathway. All-trans-retinoic acid, a prototypic AP-1 antagonist, blocked bryostatin-mediated induction of COX-2. Taken together, these results suggest that bryostatin-mediated induction of COX-2 can help to explain the myalgias that are commonly associated with treatment. Moreover, it will be worthwhile to evaluate whether the addition of a selective COX-2 inhibitor can increase the antitumor activity of bryostatin.",

    "abstract": "The voltage gated calcium channel family is a major target for a range of therapeutic drugs. Mibefradil (Ro 40-5967) belongs to a new chemical class of these molecules which differs from other Ca2+ antagonists by its ability to potently block T-type Ca2+ channels. However, this molecule has also been shown to inhibit other Ca2+ channel subtypes. To further analyze the mechanism governing the Ca2+ channel-Mibefradil interaction, we examined the effect of Mibefradil on various recombinant Ca2+ channels expressed in mammalian cells from their cloned cDNAs, using Ca2+ as the permeant ion at physiological concentration. Expression of alpha1A, alpha1C, and alpha1E in tsA 201 cells resulted in Ca2+ currents with functional characteristics closely related to those of their native counterparts. Mibefradil blocked alpha1A and alpha1E with a Kd comparable to that reported for T-type channels, but had a lower affinity (approximately 30-fold) for alpha1C. For each channel, inhibition by Mibefradil was consistent with high-affinity binding to the inactivated state. Modulation of the voltage-dependent inactivation properties by the nature of the coexpressed beta subunit or the alpha1 splice variant altered block at the Mibefradil receptor site. Therefore, we conclude that the tissue and sub-cellular localization of calcium channel subunits as well as their specific associations are essential parameters to understand the in vivo effects of Mibefradil.",

Over 96% of Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa were susceptible to polymyxin B; only 76% of Enterobacter spp. was susceptible. The MICs of CB-182,804 were generally two-fold higher than polymyxin B and cross-resistance was observed. The addition of rifampin resulted in synergistic inhibition and bactericidal activity in time kill studies, and restored activity against all polymyxin-resistant strains. The synergistic effect of the combination with rifampin was most pronounced against A. baumannii strains, and was slightly greater with CB-182,804 than with polymyxin B against K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. Despite considerable usage of polymyxin B and colistin in this region, polymyxin B retains excellent activity against most Gram-negative isolates.

We examined three members of the mouse formyl peptide receptor subfamily (mFprs) and found that they differ in agonist preference and cellular distributions. When stably expressed in transfected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, mFpr1 was readily activated by N-formylated peptides derived from Listeria monocytogenes (fMIVTLF), Staphylococcus aureus (fMIFL), and mitochondria (fMMYALF). In contrast, the Escherichia coli-derived fMLF was 1000-fold less potent. The aforementioned peptides were much less efficacious at mFpr2, which responded better to the synthetic hexapeptide WKYMVm, the synthetic agonists Quin-C1 (a substituted quinazolinone), and compound 43 (a nitrosylated pyrazolone derivative). Saturation binding assays showed that mFpr1 and mFpr2 were expressed at similar levels on the cell surface, although their affinity for N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Ile-Ile-Lys-fluorescein isothiocyanate varied by more than 1000-fold [dissociation constant (K(d)) values of 2.8 nM for mFpr1 and 4.8 muM for mFpr2]). Contrary to these receptors, mFpr-rs1 responded poorly to all the previously mentioned peptides that were tested. Fluorescent microscopy revealed an intracellular distribution pattern of mFpr-rs1. On the basis of these results, we conclude that mFpr1 is an ortholog of human FPR1 with certain pharmacologic properties of human FPR2/ALX, whereas mFpr2 has much lower affinity for formyl peptides. The intracellular distribution of mFpr-rs1 suggests an evolutionary correlation with human FPR3.",

Although several drugs have been used for the treatment of 5-HT syndrome, a universal pharmacotherapy has not been established. NMDA receptor antagonists have been reported to have neuroprotective effects. In the present study, the efficacy of NMDA antagonists, including memantine and MK-801, and potent 5-HT (2A) antagonists, including risperidone and ketanserin, was evaluated in a 5-HT syndrome animal model. METHODS: 5-Hydroxy-l-tryptophan (100 mg/kg) and clorgyline (2 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally in rats to induce 5-HT syndrome. The rectal temperature of the rats was measured, and the noradrenaline (NA) and 5-HT levels in the anterior hypothalamus were measured using a microdialysis technique. RESULTS: In the group pretreated with saline, the rectal temperature increased to more than 40 degrees C, and all of the animals died within 90 min of the drug's administration. The NA and 5-HT levels in the anterior hypothalamus increased to about 15- and 1100-fold of the pre-administration levels, respectively. Pretreatment with risperidone (0.5 mg/kg) and ketanserin (5 mg/kg) prevented the development of hyperthermia and the increase in the NA level. Memantine (10 mg/kg) and MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg) also prevented the development of hyperthermia and the increase in the NA level. These results suggest that NMDA antagonists, as well as potent 5-HT (2A) antagonists, may be effective drugs for the treatment of 5-HT syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Since memantine is clinically well tolerated, this drug is a particularly promising therapeutic drug for 5-HT syndrome treatment.",

This binding-inhibitory activity of ebastine was little more potent than that of terfenadine, but much less potent than those of mequitazine and ketotifen. These results indicated that ebastine has potent and long acting anti-allergic activity with few side effects based on the antihistaminic activity in the central nervous system. Furthermore, it was suggested that these effects of ebastine are due to the action of a main metabolite, carebastine.",

These mutations were G1048A in helix 34 and U1471C in helix 44. Restoration of function is incomplete, however, and the double mutants are slow-growing, defective in subunit association and support high levels of translational errors.

    "title": "An investigation of the neuroprotective effects of tetracycline derivatives in experimental models of retinal cell death.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and putative mechanisms of action of tetracycline and minocycline in inhibiting retinal cell apoptosis after glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and trophic factor deprivation in a retinal cell line (E1A-NR.3) and in primary mixed retinal cell cultures. In addition, a differentiated PC-12 cell line was used to determine whether minocycline was neuroprotective after trophic withdrawal in a pure neuronal cell line devoid of glia. Results from this study demonstrated that minocycline, but not tetracycline, is protective in in vitro models of excitotoxicity-induced retinal cell apoptosis. Moreover, the protective effects provided by minocycline in retinal cells seemed independent of actions on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and glutamate receptor-mediated Ca(2+) influx. Doses of the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine) and minocycline that alone provided no significant neuroprotection resulted in enhanced retinal cell survival when applied concurrently, suggestive of distinct signaling pathways, and minocycline was without effect on glutamate-induced Ca(2+) influx, as assessed by calcium imaging. Minocycline was also neuroprotective after trophic factor withdrawal, producing a decrease in apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in both retinal cells and the PC-12 neuronal-like cell line. These results support a role for minocycline as a retinal neuroprotectant and demonstrate that the antiapoptotic actions of minocycline in retinal cells do not arise from the blockage of NMDARs or glutamate receptor-mediated Ca(2+) influx but do involve inhibition of caspase-3 activation. In addition, the survival-promoting actions of minocycline may arise via actions on both neuronal and non-neuronal cell targets.",

    "title": "Muscarinic cholinoceptor regulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in human corneal epithelium.",
    "abstract": "Cultured human corneal epithelial cells showed high-affinity, specific binding to the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB). The binding sites had a dissociation constant of 3.9 nM and a maximal binding capacity of 880 fmol bound/mg protein. Other muscarinic antagonists (cyclopentolate and atropine) effectively competed for binding with 3H-QNB at low concentrations (IC50 = 10 nM). The muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol also competed for binding with 3H-QNB at somewhat higher concentrations (IC50 = 0.5 microM), and the nicotinic cholinergic agonist, nicotine, was at least 400-fold less potent than carbachol. Carbachol stimulated cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) levels in these cells up to threefold over control. This stimulation was sensitive to atropine inhibition, requiring only 2 nM atropine for 50% inhibition and 100 nM of atropine to block the carbachol effect completely. A 90% decrease in specific 3H-QNB binding was observed if cultured cells were homogenized and fractionated before assay. Significant levels of specific 3H-QNB binding could also be observed when intact human corneas were incubated with 3H-QNB and their epithelium subsequently isolated before measurement of bound radioligand. These studies indicate the presence of muscarinic cholinoceptors in human corneal epithelium which are associated with control of cyclic GMP levels in this tissue.",

In 14- to 15-week, double-blind, multinational trials and in 1-year, open-label extension studies in this patient population, opicapone was an effective and generally well tolerated adjunctive therapy to L-Dopa plus a DDCI and other PD therapy. During the double-blind phase, adjunctive opicapone 50 mg once daily provided significantly greater improvements in motor fluctuations than placebo, with these improvements noninferior to those with entacapone. These beneficial improvements in motor fluctuations with opicapone were maintained in patients who continued adjunctive opicapone during the extension studies, with patients who switched from placebo or entacapone to opicapone experiencing significant improvements in motor fluctuations during this year. No new unexpected safety concerns were identified after  1.4 years' treatment with opicapone, with no serious cases of hepatotoxicity reported in clinical trials. With its convenient once-daily regimen, oral opicapone is an emerging COMT inhibitor option for use as adjunctive therapy to L-Dopa/DDCI therapy in adults with PD and end-of dose motor fluctuations who cannot be stabilized on those combinations.",

The riboflavin overproduction phenotype of B. subtilis ribC mutant strains, which is a result of the strongly reduced flavokinase activity of the riboflavin kinase/FAD synthetase RibC, was suppressed by ribR expression. Analysis of mutations with an upregulated ribR gene revealed 2 different groups of mutants. One class of mutants contained base substitutions in an 8 nucleotide sequence of the promoter region of the ytmI-ytnM operon. A second class of mutants had single point mutations within the yrzC gene or in the RBS of this gene. Dot-blot analysis of ytmI-ytnM transcription and the results of in trans complementation experiments for the yrzC mutants confirmed a role of the yrzC gene product as a negative regulator for the ytmI-ytnM operon.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent indicators are widely used in the measurements of cytosolic calcium in many cell types for many purposes because they are relatively easy to use. Notwithstanding, they have some defects to prevent accurate measurements under certain conditions, such as significant dye leakage and UV-quenching effect. Menadione, a representative quinone derivative with antiaggregating effect, is also UV-absorbent. To investigate whether menadione can affect the change of cytosolic calcium in platelets by agonist, we measured the change of cytosolic calcium level using calcium green-1. Since this dye has not been used previously in platelets, we determined that the optimal loading of calcium green-1 to platelets was achieved using 3 microM dye incubated for 60 min at 37 degrees C. Our study compared the use of calcium green-1 with fura-2 and fluo-3 (two widely used dyes) in measurements of cytosolic calcium. Fura-2 is UV-excited, so when menadione was treated in fura-2-loaded cells, it had a quenching effect. Fluo-3, the other visible fluorescent indicator, leaked from platelets very rapidly and required the use of anion channel blockers which are known to affect physiological response of platelets. Our study demonstrated that changes in cytosolic calcium levels can be accurately measured without these problems by using calcium green-1. We therefore were able to demonstrate that menadione inhibited calcium increase by thrombin in a dose-dependent manner similar to menadione's antiaggregating effect in platelets.",

    "abstract": "The present study addresses the function of T-type voltage-gated calcium channels in insulin-secreting cells. We used whole-cell voltage and current recordings, capacitance measurements, and RIA techniques to determine the contribution of T-type calcium channels in modulation of electrical activity and in stimulus-secretion coupling in a rat insulin secreting cell line, INS-1. By employing a double pulse protocol in the current-clamp mode, we found that activation of T-type calcium channels provided a low threshold depolarizing potential that decreased the latency of onset of action potentials and furthermore increased the frequency of action potentials, both of which are abolished by administration of nickel chloride (NiCl2), a selective T-type calcium channel blocker. Moreover application of high frequency stimulation, as compared with low frequency stimulation, caused a greater change in membrane capacitance (deltaCm), suggesting higher insulin secretion. We demonstrated that glucose stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1 is reduced dose dependently by NiCl2. We conclude that T-type calcium channels facilitate insulin secretion by enhancing the general excitability of these cells. In light of the pathological effects of both hypo and hyperinsulinemia, the T-type calcium channel may be a therapeutic target.",

In comparative clinical trials, caspofungin was no less effective than liposomal amphotericin B in the empirical treatment of neutropenic patients with persistent fever, amphotericin B deoxycholate in the treatment of invasive candidiasis or fluconazole in the treatment of oesophageal candidiasis. Caspofungin also displayed broadly similar efficacy to amphotericin B deoxycholate in oesophageal or oropharyngeal candidiasis and was effective as salvage therapy in patients with invasive aspergillosis who were refractory to or intolerant of standard therapy. The tolerability profile of caspofungin was similar to that of fluconazole and superior to that of amphotericin B deoxycholate and liposomal amphotericin B. Therefore, in the appropriate indications, caspofungin is a viable alternative to amphotericin B deoxycholate, liposomal amphotericin B or fluconazole.",

    "abstract": "Opioids and nitric oxide (NO) interact functionally in different systems. NO-generating agents decrease the activity of opioid agonists, prevent opioid tolerance, and are used in opioid withdrawal syndromes. There exist, however, few reports indicating a direct interaction of the two systems. T47D human breast cancer cells in culture express opioid receptors, and opioid agonists inhibit their growth, while they release high amounts of the NO-related molecules NO(2-)/NO(3-)to the culture medium. We have used this system to assay a possible direct interaction of opiergic and nitric oxide systems. Our results show that delta- or mu-acting opioid agonists do not modify the release of NO(2-)/NO(3-). In contrast, kappa-acting opioid agonists (ethylketocyclazocine, and alpha(S1)-casomorphine) decrease the release of NO(2-)/NO(3-), in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The general opioid antagonist diprenorphine (10(-6) M) produce a similar NO(2-)/NO(3-)release inhibition, indicating a possible non-opioid-receptor mediated phenomenon. In addition, ethylketocyclazocine, alpha(S1)-casomorphin and diprenorphine directly inhibit NOS activity: agonists, interact with both calcium-dependent and independent NOS-isoforms, while the antagonist diprenorphine modifies only the activity of the calcium-dependent fraction of the enzyme. Analysis of this interaction revealed that opioids modify the dimeric active form of NOS, through binding to the reductase part of the molecule, acting as non-competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. This interaction opens interesting new possibilities for tumor biology and breast cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) on DNA synthesis and proliferation in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes and examined the influence of alpha and beta adrenoceptor agonists on the TGF-alpha-induced responses. TGF-alpha (1.0 ng/ml) produced a 4.1-fold elevation of DNA synthesis during 3 h of culture and a 1.2-fold increase in the nucleus number (proliferation) during 4 h of culture at a cell density of 3.3 x 10(4) cells/cm(2). The TGF-alpha-induced hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation were dose-dependent at EC(50) values of 0.36 ng/ml and 0.45 ng/ml, respectively. Hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation induced by 1.0 ng/ml TGF-alpha did not reduce even at higher initial plating densities (5.0 x 10(4) and 1.0 x 10(5) cells/cm(2)). Increasing concentrations of the beta(2) adrenoceptor agonist metaproterenol (10(-7)-10(-6) M) markedly reduced the proliferative effects of TGF-alpha, whereas those of the alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonist 5-bromo-6-[2-imidazolin-2-yl-amino]-quinoxaline (UK-14304; 10(-6)-10(-5) M) and the alpha(1) adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (10(-7)-10(-6) M) significantly potentiated the TGF-alpha action. The proliferative effects of TGF-alpha (1.0 ng/ml) were not affected significantly by a monoclonal antiepidermal growth factor receptor antibody (1-100 ng/ml) and were almost completely blocked by specific inhibitors of signal transducers such as genistein (10(-5) M), 1-6[[17beta-3methoxyestra-1,3, 5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrol2,5-dione (U-73122; 0(-5) M), wortmannin (5 x 10(-7) M), sphingosine (5 x 10(-6) M), 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (PD98059; 5 x 10(-5) M), and rapamycin (10 ng/ml). These results suggest that among the elements that link signals of cell surface receptor to the nucleus, the proliferative action of TGF-alpha is mediated, at least, by tyrosine kinase, phospholipase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and ribosomal protein p70 S6 kinase.",

    "abstract": "A critical component in the regulation of thrombus formation and clearance is the balance between tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). An increase in the plasma concentration of PAI-1 has been proposed as a risk factor in thrombotic disease. Inhibition of PAI-1 activity may have utility in the treatment of thromboembolic disease. We report here the evaluation of three diketopiperazine-based low molecular weight inhibitors of PAI-1 activity (XR334, XR1853 and XR5082). In vitro these compounds reversed the inhibitory effects of PAI-1 against both tPA and urokinase (UK) (IC50: 5 to 80 muM). In contrast, other serpin-serine protease interactions, including alpha 1-antitrypsin-trypsin, alpha 2-antiplasmin- plasmin and antithrombin-thrombin, were not affected, neither did these inhibitors affect global tests of haemostasis. In the light of this promising in vitro profile these compounds were evaluated in a standard radioisotopic assay of clot lysis in whole rat blood following intravenous administration. In this assay these compounds dose-dependently enhanced fibrinolysis ex vivo. After intravenous bolus administration XR334, XR1853 and XR5082 at 5 mg/kg increased clot lysis by 32.0 +/- 5.1% SEM (n = 25, p &lt; 0.01), 36.7 +/- 3.5% SEM (n = 36, p &lt; 0.01) and 60.0 +/- 2.8% SEM (n = 17, p &lt; 0.01) respectively compared to vehicle. Intravenous infusion of these compounds (1 mg/kg/min for 20 min) significantly prolonged (approximately twofold) the time to blood vessel occlusion in the rat electrically-stimulated carotid artery thrombosis model. Thus, these low molecular weight inhibitors of PAI-1 activity enhanced fibrinolysis ex vivo and protected against thrombus formation in the rat.",

In situ hybridization histochemistry with digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes revealed for the first time the expression of mt1 and MT2 melatonin receptor mRNA within the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the C3H/HeN mouse. Melatonin (0.9 to 30 microg/mouse, s.c.) administration during 3 days at the end of the subjective day (CT 10) to C3H/HeN mice kept in constant dark phase advanced circadian rhythms of wheel running activity in a dose-dependent manner [EC50=0.72 microg/mouse; 0.98+/-0.08 h (n=15) maximal advance at 9 microg/mouse]. Neither the selective MT2 melatonin receptor antagonists 4P-ADOT and 4P-PDOT (90 microg/mouse, s.c.) nor luzindole (300 microg/mouse, s.c.), which shows 25-fold higher affinity for the MT2 than the mt1 subtype, affected the phase of circadian activity rhythms when given alone at CT 10. All three antagonists, however, shifted to the right the dose-response curve to melatonin, as they significantly reduced the phase shifting effects of 0.9 and 3 microg melatonin. This is the first study to demonstrate that melatonin phase advances circadian rhythms by activation of a membrane-bound melatonin receptor and strongly suggests that this effect is mediated through the MT2 melatonin receptor subtype within the circadian timing system. We conclude that the MT2 melatonin receptor subtype is a novel therapeutic target for the development of subtype-selective analogs for the treatment of circadian sleep and mood-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "In the present experiments, unilateral ovariectomy (ULO) induced compensatory hypertrophy (COH) of the remaining rat ovary (60%-85% increase in ovarian weight, total proteins, and total RNA and DNA). An increased thymidine uptake preceded the organ enlargement. COH was inhibited by i.p.-administered muscarinic antagonist propantheline (dose-dependently) or botulinum toxin delivered locally to the ovary. The effects were reversed by bethanecol i.p. (a muscarinic agonist). In sham ULO animals, [3H]-scopolamine binding to ovarian membranes indicated the existence of muscarinic receptors (Kd 2.5 nM, Bmax 12 fmol/mg proteins, Hill 1.0). The ovarian 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) was 120-150 pmol/mg tissue and did not react to carbachol in vitro (50 microM). At 15 minutes after ULO, the [3H]-scopolamine binding was unchanged (Kd 2.6 nM, Bmax 12.6 fmol/mg tissue, Hill 1.0), but the ovarian DAG was increased (280-350 pmol/mg tissue) and increased further in response to carbachol (460-550 pmol/mg tissue). After ULO, ovarian DAG remained continuously responsive to carbachol. The ULO-induced DAG increase and enhanced susceptibility to carbachol were inhibited by the botulinum toxin or atropine pretreatments. Abdominal vagotomy done immediately before ULO also inhibited the ULO-induced DAG increase and DAG responsiveness to carbachol. However, when the vagotomy was performed 10 mins after ULO, the ovarian DAG remained responsive to carbachol in vitro. The data suggest that the peripheral cholinergic system, including the ovarian muscarinic receptors, stimulates COH. This is apparently associated with the ULO-induced coupling of the ovarian muscarinic receptors to phosphoinositide (PI) breakdown. Vagus plays a role in the occurrence of the changed muscarinic receptor-PI breakdown relationship in the remaining ovary.",

    "abstract": "Alanine racemase, an enzyme important to bacterial cell wall synthesis, is irreversibly inactivated by 3-chloro- and 3-fluorovinylglycine. Using alanine racemase purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli B, the efficient inactivation produced a lethal event for every 2.2 +/- 0.2 nonlethal turnovers, compared to 1 in 800 for fluoroalanine. The mechanism of inhibition involves enzyme-catalyzed halide elimination to form an allenic intermediate that partitions between reversible and irreversible covalent adducts, in the ratio 3:7. The reversible adduct (lambda max = 516 nm) decays to regenerate free enzyme with a half-life of 23 min. The lethal event involves irreversible alkylation of a tyrosine residue in the sequence -Val-Gly-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Arg. The second-order rate constant for this process with D-chlorovinylglycine (122 +/- 14 M-1 s-1), the most reactive analog examined, is faster than the equivalent rate constant for D-fluoroalanine (93 M-1 s-1). The high killing efficiency and fast turnover of these mechanism-based inhibitors suggest that their design, employing the haloethylene moiety to generate a reactive allene during catalysis, could be extended to provide useful inhibitors of a variety of enzymes that conduct carbanion chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent chemoattractant and activator for granulocytes and macrophages and is considered to be an inflammatory mediator. Two G-protein-coupled receptors for LTB4, BLT1 and BLT2, have been cloned from human and shown to be high and low affinity LTB4 receptors, respectively. To reveal the biological roles of BLT2 using mouse disease models, we cloned and characterized mouse BLT2. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing mouse BLT2 exhibited specific binding to LTB4, LTB4-induced calcium mobilization, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. We found that Compound A (4'-{[pentanoyl (phenyl) amino] methyl}-1, 1'-biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid) was a BLT2-selective agonist and induced Ca(2+) mobilization and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase through BLT2, whereas it had no effect on BLT1. 12-epi LTB4 exhibited a partial agonistic activity against mBLT1 and mBLT2, whereas 6-trans-12-epi LTB4 did not. Northern blot analysis showed that mouse BLT2 is expressed highly in small intestine and skin in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of human BLT2. By in situ hybridization and the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated that mouse BLT2 is expressed in follicular and interfollicular keratinocytes. Compound A, LTB4, and 12-epi LTB4 all induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in primary mouse keratinocytes. Furthermore, Compound A and LTB4 induced chemotaxis in primary mouse keratinocytes. These data suggest the presence of functional BLT2 in primary keratinocytes.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This clinical trial investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of CHR-3996, a selective class I histone deacetylase inhibitor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CHR-3996 was administered orally once a day. This phase I trial used a 3+3 dose-escalation design. PK profiles were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopic methods and PD studies were conducted using ELISA studying histone H3 acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were treated at dose levels of 5 mg (n = 3), 10 mg (n = 4), 20 mg (n = 3), 40 mg (n = 10), 80 mg (n = 10), 120 mg (n = 4), and 160 mg (n = 5) administered orally once daily. The dose-limiting toxicities seen were thrombocytopenia (160 mg), fatigue (80 and 120 mg), plasma creatinine elevation (80 and 120 mg), and atrial fibrillation (40 mg). The area under the curve was proportional to the administered dose and a maximal plasma concentration of 259 ng/mL at a dose of 40 mg exceeded the concentrations required for antitumor efficacy in preclinical models. Target inhibition measured by quantification of histone acetylation was shown at doses of 10 mg/d and was maximal at 40 mg. A partial response was seen in one patient with metastatic acinar pancreatic carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Taking the toxicity and PK/PD profile into consideration, the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is 40 mg/d. At this dose, CHR-3996 has a favorable toxicologic, PK, and PD profile. CHR-3996 has shown preliminary clinical activity and should be evaluated in further clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Z-100 is an arabinomannan extracted from Mycobacterium tuberculosis that has various immunomodulatory activities, such as the induction of interleukin 12, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and beta-chemokines. The effects of Z-100 on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) are investigated in this paper. In MDMs, Z-100 markedly suppressed the replication of not only macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strain (HIV-1JR-CSF), but also HIV-1 pseudotypes that possessed amphotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus G envelopes. Z-100 was found to inhibit HIV-1 expression, even when added 24 h after infection. In addition, it substantially inhibited the expression of the pNL43lucDeltaenv vector (in which the env gene is defective and the nef gene is replaced with the firefly luciferase gene) when this vector was transfected directly into MDMs. These findings suggest that Z-100 inhibits virus replication, mainly at HIV-1 transcription. However, Z-100 also downregulated expression of the cell surface receptors CD4 and CCR5 in MDMs, suggesting some inhibitory effect on HIV-1 entry. Further experiments revealed that Z-100 induced IFN-beta production in these cells, resulting in induction of the 16-kDa CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) beta transcription factor that represses HIV-1 long terminal repeat transcription. These effects were alleviated by SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), indicating that the p38 MAPK signalling pathway was involved in Z-100-induced repression of HIV-1 replication in MDMs. These findings suggest that Z-100 might be a useful immunomodulator for control of HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall component peptidoglycan. The enzyme is the target of the antibiotic fosfomycin. A lysine residue (K22), strictly conserved in MurAs and the structurally and mechanistically related 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthases (EPSPS), is located near the active center of the enzyme. This residue is thought to be involved directly in the binding of the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and also to participate in the conformational change leading to the formation of the catalytically competent enzyme complex. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have replaced this lysine with arginine (K22R), valine (K22V), and glutamate (K22E). These mutant proteins were expressed, purified, and characterized in comparison to wild-type MurA and a previously described inactive C115S mutant protein. It was found that all three K22 mutant proteins had less than 0.5% of the wild-type activity. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, it could be shown that the binding parameters for the UDP-sugar nucleotide substrate are not affected by the mutations, except for the K22E mutant protein. Similarly, binding of PEP was found to be unaffected in the K22 mutant proteins as demonstrated by tryptophan fluorescence quench titrations. On the other hand, the level of formation of a covalent adduct with either PEP or fosfomycin with the thiol group of cysteine 115 was diminished. The propensity to form an adduct with PEP decreased in the following order: wild type &gt;&gt; K22R &gt; K22V &gt; K22E. A comparable effect was found on the formation of the inhibitory covalent adduct of MurA and the antibiotic fosfomycin. These results are discussed in terms of an involvement of lysine 22 in a conformational change of MurA.",

These compounds function as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and have shown substantial potency in reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes in vitro. However, it has been difficult to define the mode of action of these drugs in patients and it appears that clinical responses are influenced both by epigenetic alterations and by apoptosis induction. To maximize the clinical efficacy of azacytidine and decitabine it will be important to understand the molecular changes induced by these drugs. In this review, we examine the pharmacological properties of azanucleosides and their interactions with various cellular pathways. Because azacytidine and decitabine are prodrugs, an understanding of the cellular mechanisms mediating transmembrane transport and metabolic activation will be critically important for optimizing patient responses. We also discuss the mechanism of DNA methyltransferase inhibition and emphasize the need for the identification of predictive biomarkers for the further advancement of epigenetic therapies.",

    "abstract": "PHA-848125 is a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor under Phase I/II clinical investigation. In this study, we describe, for the first time, the effect of PHA-848125 on human melanoma cells in vitro. Seven melanoma cell lines with different sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) were exposed to PHA-848125 for 5 days and then assayed for cell growth. In all cases, including TMZ-resistant cells, PHA-848125 IC(50) values were significantly below the maximum plasma concentrations achievable in the clinic. In the most PHA-848125-sensitive cell line, the drug caused a concentration-dependent G(1) arrest. PHA-848125 also impaired phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein at CDK2 and CDK4 specific sites, decreased retinoblastoma protein and cyclin A levels, and increased p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1) and p53 expression. Combined treatment with fixed ratios of TMZ plus PHA-848125 was studied in three melanoma cell lines. PHA-848125 was added to the cells 48 h after TMZ and cell growth was evaluated after 3 additional days of culture. Parallel experiments were performed in the presence of O(6)-benzylguanine (BG), to prevent repair of methyl adducts at O(6)-guanine induced by TMZ. Drug combination of TMZ plus BG and PHA-848125 produced additive or synergistic effects on cell growth, depending on the cell line. In the absence of BG, the combination was still more active than the single agents in the cell line moderately sensitive to TMZ, but comparable to PHA-848125 alone in the two TMZ-resistant cell lines. When TMZ plus BG were used in combination with PHA-848125 against cultured normal melanocytes, neither synergistic nor additive antiproliferative effects were observed. Our results indicate that PHA-848125 can have a therapeutic potential in melanoma patients, alone or combined with TMZ. Moreover this agent appears to be particularly attractive on the bases of its effectiveness against TMZ-resistant melanoma cells.",

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) alpha and gamma are members of nuclear receptor superfamily. Their agonists are prescribed as antihyperlipidemic and antihyperglycemic drugs now. In this study, sesquiterpene lactones, tirotundin and tagitinin A, were isolated from T. diversifolia and evaluated for their activity against PPARs by the transient transfection reporter assay. Tirotundin and tagitinin A transactivated PPARgamma dependent promoters including PPRE (PPARgamma response element), SHP, and ABCA1 gene promoters in dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the fluorescence polarization competitive binding assay showed that tirotundin (IC(50)=27 muM) and tagitinin A (IC(50)=55 muM) enhanced PPARgamma transactivation activity by directly binding to PPARgamma ligand binding domain. Additionally, they stimulated the transactivation of PPARalpha dependent SULT2A1 gene promoter by 2.3-fold of vehicle effect at 10 muM. These results highly indicated that tirotundin and tagitinin A are the active components of T. diversifolia to exert anti-diabetic effect through PPARgamma pathway. Moreover, these sesquiterpene lactones behaved as PPARalpha/gamma dual agonists so they might be useful as the potential herbal treatment for diabetes.",

In the present study, we examined the effect of EPA on endogenous leptin expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes to clarify whether the EPA's effect is exerted through leptin expression.

We examined the effect on leptin expression of clofibrate, a ligand for PPARalpha, bezafibrate, for PPARbeta, or troglitazone, for PPARgamma, to clarify whether these ligands for PPARs could mimic EPA-induced stimulation of leptin expression. Neither clofibrate nor bezafibrate affected leptin mRNA expression, whereas troglitazone significantly suppressed leptin mRNA expression. On the other hand, inhibition by 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine of the rate-limiting enzyme in hexosamine biosynthesis blunted EPA-induced stimulation of leptin mRNA expression and its secretion.

Antimalarial naphthoquinones such as atovaquone (566c80) inhibit malarial DHOD by inhibiting electron transport. Since atovaquone also has therapeutic activity against Pneumocystis carinii, the P. carinii DHOD may also be an important drug target. Organisms were obtained from immunosuppressed rats, incubated for 24 h in a short-term in vitro culture system, and then lysed. P. carinii lysates catalyzed the generation of orotate from dihydroorotate at a rate of 852 pmol/mg of protein per min. Control preparations made from uninfected mice showed much less total enzymatic activity and enzyme specific activity. As expected, P. carinii DHOD activity was susceptible to respiratory inhibitors such as cyanide, antimycin A, and salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM). Susceptibility to SHAM suggests the presence of an alternative oxidase. In contrast, neither pentamidine nor 5-hydroxy-6-demethylprimaquine (5H6DP), a quinone metabolite of primaquine, inhibited the enzyme. Atovaquone inhibited DHOD by 76.3% at 100 microM and 36.5% at 10 microM. A similar degree of inhibition was found when the organisms were preincubated with the drug. Atovaquone inhibited P. carinii growth in vitro at a somewhat lower concentration (between 0.3 and 3 microM). In contrast, Plasmodium falciparum growth and enzyme activity are susceptible to nanomolar concentrations of atovaquone. Thus, while it is possible that atovaquone acts by inhibiting the P. carinii electron transport chain, the possibility of another drug target cannot be excluded.",

    "title": "Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Afamelanotide and its Clinical Use in Treating Dermatologic Disorders.",
    "abstract": "Afamelanotide, the first alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) analogue, synthesized in 1980, was broadly investigated in all aspects of pigmentation because its activity and stability were higher than the natural hormone. Afamelanotide binds to the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), and MC1R signaling increases melanin synthesis, induces antioxidant activities, enhances DNA repair processes and modulates inflammation. The loss-of-function variants of the MC1R present in fair-skinned Caucasians are less effectively activated by the natural hormone. Afamelanotide was the first alpha-MSH analogue to be applied to human volunteers. Ten daily doses of between 0.08 and 0.21 mg/kg in saline injected subcutaneously resulted in long-lasting skin pigmentation and enabled basic pharmacokinetics. Subcutaneous application had full bioavailability, but neither oral nor transdermal application resulted in measurable plasma concentrations or pigmentation response. Two trials in human volunteers showed that neither MC1R variants nor fair skin reduced the afamelanotide-induced increase in skin pigmentation. A controlled-release formulation optimizes administration in man and is effective at a lower dose than the daily saline injections. Promising therapeutic results were published in polymorphic light eruption, erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), solar urticaria, Hailey-Hailey disease and vitiligo. In 2014, afamelanotide was approved by the European Medicines Agency for the prevention of phototoxicity in adult patients with EPP. No late effects were reported in volunteers 25 years after the first exposure or after continuous long-term application of up to 8 years in EPP patients, and an immunogenic potential has been excluded. Generally, adverse effects were benign in all trials.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evaluate the potential role of p38 inhibitors for the treatment of osteoarthritis using an animal model of joint degeneration (iodoacetate-induced arthritis) and a pain model (Hargraeves assay). METHODS: P38 kinase activity was evaluated in a kinase assay by measuring the amount of phosphorylated substrate ATF2 using a phosphoATF2 (Thr71) specific primary antibody and an alkaline phosphate coupled secondary antibody and measuring the OD at 405 nm. TNFalpha and IL-1beta secretion from LPS stimulated THP-1 monocytic cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured by ELISA. Rats treated with vehicle or p38 inhibitor were injected intra-articularly in one knee with iodoacetate and damage to the tibial plateau was assessed from digitized images captured using an image analyzer. The effect of p38 inhibitors on hyperalgesia was evaluated in rats given an intraplantar injection of carrageenan and 4 h later the paw withdrawal time to a radiant heat source was measured. RESULTS: SB-203580 and VX-745 are both potent inhibitors of p38 with IC50s of 136 +/- 64 nM and 35 +/- 14 nM (mean +/- S.D.), respectively. Similarly, SB-203580 and VX-745 potently inhibited TNF release from LPS stimulated human THP-1 cells with IC50s of 72 +/- 15 nM; and 29 +/- 14 nM (mean +/- S.D.) respectively. TNF release from LPS stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was inhibited with IC50s 16 +/- 6 nM and 14 +/- 8 nM, (mean +/- S.D.) for SB-203580 and VX-745 and IL-1 was inhibited with IC50s of 20 +/- 8 nM and 15 +/- 4 nM (mean +/- S.D.), respectively. SB-203580 and VX-745 administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg resulted in the significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition of joint degeneration in the rat iodoacetate model of 45% and 31%, respectively. SB-203580 demonstrated a dose related inhibition of joint degeneration of 30, 25, 12 and 8% at 50, 25, 10 and 5 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d. in the rat iodoacetate model. Similarly, both p38 inhibitors significantly (p &lt; 0.05) attenuated the pain response (paw withdrawal time) in the Hargraeves hyperalgesia assay when administered orally at 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: SB203580 and VX-745 demonstrated attenuation of both cartilage degeneration and pain in animal models and suggest that p38 inhibitors may be a useful approach for the treatment of osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "A protective capacity of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) against various insults inducing neurone cell death in vitro and in vivo has been well established. We have recently shown the rapid up-regulation and persistent expression of TGF-beta1 in surviving CA1 pyramidal cells after cerebral ischemia suggesting an endogenous mechanism of neuroprotection by this multifunctional cytokine. In the present study, we demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of clenbuterol, a lipophilic beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, caused an increase in TGF-beta1 expression in non-ischemic rats and further enhanced TGF-beta1 protein levels in rat CA1 pyramidal neurones after transient forebrain ischemia. In the hippocampus neuroprotection by clenbuterol (0.5 mg/kg) was accompanied by increased TGF-beta1 immunoreactivity as early as 3 h, and remained elevated up to 2 days after ischemia. The corresponding increased TGF-beta1 mRNA levels after ischemia were not further enhanced by clenbuterol, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of TGF-beta1 protein after beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation. In saline-treated rats latent TGF-beta-binding protein-1 (LTBP-1) immunoreactivity was moderately elevated 3 and 6 h after ischemia, and returned to control levels after 1 day of reperfusion. In parallel with the up-regulation of TGF-beta1 immunoreactivity, LTBP-1 levels in the hippocampus were considerably increased by clenbuterol from 3 h to 2 days after ischemia. Our data demonstrate a concomitant increase in LTBP-1 and TGF-beta1 expression in the ischemic hippocampus after stimulation of beta(2)-adrenoceptors.",

This has been substantiated by recent advances in genetic research. A common mu-opioid receptor polymorphism was associated with higher demands for alfentanil or morphine for pain relief. It also decreased the potency of morphine for pupil constriction and experimental analgesia, but its molecular mechanisms are unclear. Another opioid receptor mutation greatly impaired receptor signalling in vitro, but is very rare. The accumulated evidence provides a solid basis for continuing research that should address the underlying molecular mechanisms and the role and benefits of OPRM1 genotyping for clinical pain therapy.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the feasibility, safety, and potential benefit in motor symptom control when switching from a dopamine agonist to tolcapone as an adjunctive therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease with a fluctuating response to levodopa (l-dopa). We determined the efficacy of 2 replacement strategies. METHODS: In this 10-week, randomized, open-label, stratified, parallel-group trial, 150 patients on a stable regimen of l-dopa/decarboxylase inhibitor in combination with bromocriptine, lisuride, or pergolide were switched to tolcapone. Primary end point was the change in daily \"off\" time from baseline to the end of week 10 as assessed by patient \"on-off\" diaries. Patients had their respective dopamine agonist reduced and finally withdrawn either by day 6 (short-term replacement, n = 72) or by day 23 (long-term replacement, n = 78). RESULTS: At week 10, a significant reduction from baseline in daily \"off\" time (-15.9 +/- 19.3%; P < 0.001) and a significant increase of \"on\" time (14.6 +/- 19.8%; P < 0.001) were observed. Other efficacy variables (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale II, III, and IVb and Investigator's Global Assessment scores) improved significantly after switching to tolcapone. In general, there was no significant difference between the 2 replacement strategies. Treatment was better tolerated after the switch to tolcapone according to the IGA of tolerability. CONCLUSIONS: Tolcapone, in principle, seems to be an alternative adjunct for patients, who fail to receive sufficient benefit from a dopamine agonist, for example, in case they do not tolerate an increase in dose or have unacceptable side effects. The switch from a dopamine agonist to tolcapone can be done safely within a few days.",

Current therapeutic methods using acetylcholine analogs or laxative agents have unwanted side effects, besides often fail to have desired effect. Various ion channels such as ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel, calcium ions (Ca(2+))-activated potassium ions (K(+)) channels, voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels and chloride ion (Cl(-)) channels are abundantly expressed in GI tissues, and play an important role in regulating GI motility. The release of neurotransmitters from the enteric nerve terminal, innervating GI interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and smooth muscle cells (SMC), causes inactivation of K(+) and Cl(-) channels, increasing Ca(2+) influx into cytoplasm, resulting in membrane depolarization and smooth muscle contraction. Thus, agents directly regulating ion channels activity either in ICC or in SMC may affect GI peristalsis and would be potential therapeutic target for the treatment of GI dysmotility with SCI.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chiral local anesthetics, such as ropivacaine and levobupivacaine, have the potential advantage over racemic mixtures in showing reduced toxic side effects. However, these S-(levo, or \"-\")isomers also have reportedly lower potency than their optical antipode, possibly resulting in no advantage in therapeutic index. Potency for local anesthetics inhibiting Na+ channels or action potentials depends on the pattern of membrane potential and so also does the stereopotency ratio. Here the authors have quantitated the stereopotencies of R-, S-, and racemic bupivacaine, comparing several in vitro assays of neuronal Na+ channels with those from in vivo functional nerve block, to establish relative potencies and to understand better the role of different modes of channel inhibition in overall functional anesthesia. METHODS: The binding of bupivacaine to Na+ channels was assessed indirectly by its antagonism of [3H]-batrachotoxin binding to rat brain synaptosomes. Inhibition of Na+ currents by bupivacaine was directly assayed in voltage-clamped GH-3 neuroendocrine cells. Neurobehavioral functions were disrupted by bupivacaine percutaneously injected (0.1 ml; 0.0625-1.0%) at the rat sciatic nerve and semiquantitatively assayed. Concentration-dependent actions of R-, S-, and racemic bupivacaine were compared for their magnitude and duration of action. RESULTS: Competitive batrachotoxin displacement has a stereopotency ratio of R:S = 3:1. Inhibition of Na+ currents with different prepulse potentials shows that S &gt; R potency when the membrane is hyperpolarized, and R &gt; S potency when it is depolarized from normal resting values. Functional deficits assayed in vivo usually demonstrate no consistent enantioselectivity and only a modest stereopotency (R:S = 1.2-1.3) for peak analgesia achieved at the lowest doses. Other functions display no significant stereopotency in either the degree, the duration, or their product (area under the curve) at any dose. CONCLUSION: Although the in vitro actions of bupivacaine showed stereoselectivity ratios of 1.3-3:1 (R:S), in vivo nerve block at clinically used concentrations showed much smaller ratios for peak effect and no significant enantioselectivity for duration. A primary role for the blockade of resting rather than open or inactivated Na+ channels may explain the modest stereoselectivity in vivo, although stereoselective factors controlling local disposition cannot be ruled out. Levo-(S-)bupivacaine is effectively equipotent to R- or racemic bupivacaine in vivo for rat sciatic nerve block.",

Miconazole increases the plasma concentration of QT-prolonging drugs by inhibiting the hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic pathway, but whether it has direct effects on cardiac ion channels has not been elucidated. 2. To determine the mechanism underlying these clinical findings, we investigated the effect of miconazole on human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) K+ channels. 3. HERG channels were heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and whole-cell currents were recorded using a patch-clamp technique (23 degrees C). 4. Miconazole inhibited HERG peak tail current in a concentration-dependent manner (0.4-40 microM) with an IC50 of 2.1 microM (n=3-5 cells at each concentration, Hill coefficient 1.2). HERG block was not frequency-dependent. It required channel activation, occurred rapidly, and had very slow dissociation properties. 5. The activation curve was shifted in a negative direction (V(1/2): -9.5+/-2.3 mV in controls and -15.3+/-2.4 mV after 4 microM miconazole, P&lt;0.05, n=6). Miconazole did not change other channel kinetics (activation, deactivation, onset of inactivation, recovery from inactivation, steady-state inactivation). 6. The S6 domain mutation, F656C, abolished the inhibitory action of miconazole on HERG current indicating that miconazole preferentially binds to an aromatic amino-acid residue within the pore-S6 region. 7. Our findings indicate that miconazole causes HERG channel block by binding to a common drug receptor, and this involves preferential binding to activated channels. Thus, miconazole prolongs the QT interval by direct inhibition of HERG channels.",

A combination of docking and dynamics calculations allowed us to build three-dimensional models of the complexes between Src and several of its known inhibitors. Interactions most contributing to activity of the inhibitors, in terms of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, were codified into pharmacophoric models that were in turn applied to perform a search of commercially available compounds within the Asinex database. As a result, we identified 1,3,4-thiadiazoles and pyrazolydine-3,5-diones showing inhibitory activity in the submicromolar range in a cell-free assay toward Src. Moreover, since several of the compounds used to generate pharmacophores were also known as Abl inhibitors, we tested the identified hits toward Abl tyrosine kinase, finding activity in the submicromolar range. Such biological data suggested that the computational protocol is an efficient tool for identifying new hits toward both Src and Abl.",

    "abstract": "The effects of prolonged exposure of M(2) muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, to the allosteric modulators gallamine, alcuronium, and heptane-1,7-bis (dimethyl-3'-phthalimidopropyl)-ammonium bromide (C(7)/3'-phth) were compared with the effects of the agonist carbachol (CCh) and antagonists atropine and N-methylscopolamine (NMS). Intact cell saturation binding assays using [(3)H]NMS found that pretreatment of the cells for 24 h with CCh caused a significant down-regulation of receptor number, whereas atropine, NMS, and all three allosteric modulators caused receptor up-regulation. Functional assays using a cytosensor microphysiometer to measure whole-cell metabolic rate found no acute effects of gallamine on receptor signaling, whereas atropine seemed to behave as an inverse agonist. Pretreatment of the cells with gallamine (20 microM) or atropine (20 nM) resulted in a significant enhancement of the maximal effect evoked by CCh. In contrast, CCh (100 microM) pretreatment resulted in a significant reduction in maximal receptor signaling capacity. Time-course experiments revealed that the effects of atropine and gallamine on receptor up-regulation are only visualized after at least 12-h ligand exposure, compared with the more rapid effects of CCh, which achieve steady-state down-regulation within 90 min. Additional experiments monitoring CCh-mediated M(2) mAChR internalization in the presence of gallamine revealed that part of the mechanism underlying the effects of the modulator on receptor expression may involve a change in receptor internalization properties. These findings suggest that, like orthosteric ligands, G protein-coupled receptor allosteric modulators also are able to mediate long-term effects on receptor regulation.",

A distinct increase in sorbitol content and a slight decrease in myo-inositol content was observed in the sciatic nerve of STZ diabetic rats, and the sorbitol accumulation was dose dependently suppressed by treatment with M16209 and M16287. Treatment started at an earlier period was more effective in the suppression of sorbitol accumulation. There was a significant correlation between motor nerve conduction velocity and nerve sorbitol content, whereas there was none between motor nerve conduction velocity and myo-inositol content.

    "title": "Memantine: New prospective in bipolar disorder treatment.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: We review preclinical and clinical evidences strongly suggesting that memantine, an old drug currently approved for Alzheimer's dementia, is an effective treatment for acute mania and for the prevention of manic/hypomanic and depressive recurrences of manic-depressive illness. Lithium remains the first line for the treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar disorders, but currently available treatment alternatives for lithium resistant patients are of limited and/or questionable efficacy. Thus, research and development of more effective mood stabilizer drugs is a leading challenge for modern psychopharmacology. We have demonstrated that 21 d administration of imipramine causes a behavioural syndrome similar to a cycle of bipolar disorder, i.e., a mania followed by a depression, in rats. Indeed, such treatment causes a behavioural supersensitivity to dopamine D2 receptor agonists associated with an increase sexual activity and aggressivity (mania). The dopamine receptor sensitization is followed, after imipramine discontinuation, by an opposite phenomenon (dopamine receptor desensitization) and an increased immobility time (depression) in the forced swimming test of depression. Memantine blocks the development of the supersensitivity and the ensuing desensitization associated with the depressive like behavior. On the basis of these observations we have suggested the use of memantine in the treatment of mania and in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorders. To test this hypothesis we performed several naturalistic studies that showed an acute antimanic effect and a long-lasting and progressive mood-stabilizing action (at least 3 years), without clinically relevant side effects. To confirm the observations of our naturalistic trials we are now performing a randomized controlled clinical trial. Finally we described the studies reporting the efficacy of memantine in manic-like symptoms occurring in psychiatric disorders other than bipolar. LIMITATIONS: A randomized controlled clinical trial is needed to confirm our naturalistic observations. CONCLUSION: We believe that this review presents enough pharmacological and clinical information to consider the administration of memantine in the treatment of bipolar disorders that no respond to standard mood stabilizers.",

    "abstract": "Immune thrombocytopenia is a common complication of therapy with a large number of drugs. The most widely studied drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DIT) is caused by quinine. In most cases of DIT, antibodies bind to the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex in a drug-dependent fashion and bring about increased platelet clearance by the reticuloendothelial system resulting in thrombocytopenia. Here, we report the characterization of the quinine-dependent antibody activity of sera from 13 patients with quinine-induced thrombocytopenia. In our series of patients, GPIX was the most prevalent target of quinine-dependent antibodies. To identify the structural determinants of GPIX recognized by quinine-dependent antibodies, 4 chimeric mouse/human GPIX constructs and stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that expressed the chimeras in association with GPIbalpha and GPIbbeta were produced. The analysis of 6 patient sera with the chimeric cell lines provided evidence for localization of the anti-GPIX quinine-dependent antibody binding site to the C-ext region (amino acid [aa] 64-135) of human GPIX. Further characterization of the C-ext region of the GPIX indicated that replacement of the Arg110 and Gln115 of the human GPIX with the corresponding residues from mouse (Gln and Glu, respectively) resulted in a significant reduction in the binding of GPIX antibodies in our series of patients, with Arg110Gln, giving a more pronounced effect than Gln115Glu. Hence, these 2 residues, particularly Arg110, play an important role in the structure of the antigenic site on GPIX recognized by anti-GPIX antibodies.",

    "abstract": "1. The aim of the present study was to characterize the presynaptic alpha 2-autoreceptors in human right atrium in terms of the alpha 2A-D system. Segments of atrial appendages were preincubated with [3H]-noradrenaline and then superfused in the presence of cocaine and stimulated electrically. pEC30% values of eight alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists with discriminatory power were determined. pEC30% is the negative logarithm of the antagonist concentration that increased the stimulation-induced overflow of tritium by 30%. For four antagonists, the dissociation constant KD was determined, in addition to pEC30%, against the overflow-inhibiting effect of 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline (UK 14,304) under autoinhibition-free conditions. 2. pEC30% and KD values yielded identical rank orders of antagonist affinity (rauwolscine &gt; WB 4101 &gt; phentolamine &gt; prazosin) suggesting that both released noradrenaline and the exogenous agonist UK 14,304 activated the same receptor to inhibit release. 3. The eight antagonist pEC30% values obtained in right atrium correlated significantly with their pEC30% values, reported in the literature, at the presynaptic alpha 2C-autoreceptors in human kidney (r = 0.817; slope of the regression line 1.03). No significant correlation was obtained between pEC30% values at atrial autoreceptors and pKD values at previously characterized alpha 2A-autoreceptors in rabbit and alpha 2D-autoreceptors in rat, mouse and guinea-pig tissues. 4. Comparison of antagonist pEC30% values with their pKD values at native alpha 2 binding sites in cells or tissues that express a single subtype only, and with pKD values at alpha 2 binding sites in membranes of COS cells transfected with human alpha 2 subtype genes confirms the alpha 2C character of the atrial autoreceptors: significant correlations were obtained exclusively with the alpha 2C binding sites. 5. Ratios of KD values were computed for alpha 2-autoreceptors in human right atrium and for binding sites in COS cells transfected with human alpha 2 subtype genes. The autoreceptor ratios corresponded well with the respective ratios for the alpha 2C binding sites (maximal three fold deviation) but were, in part, markedly different from ratios calculated for alpha 2A and alpha 2B binding sites (up to 166 fold deviation). This outcome supports the alpha 2C designation of the autoreceptors. 6. In conclusion, the presynaptic alpha 2-autoreceptors in human right atrium are alpha 2C. In this they agree with the previously characterized alpha 2-autoreceptors in human kidney. The alpha 2C classification possibly separates, in general, human alpha 2-autoreceptors from those in lagomorph (rabbit) and rodent (rat, mouse, guinea pig) species that have been proposed to be predominantly alpha 2A or alpha 2D.",

Thus, there is a strong need for the development of small molecule chemistries with selective V(2) receptor agonist activity. Using the functional cell-based assay Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology (R-SAT((R))), a screening effort identified three small molecule chemotypes (AC-94544, AC-88324, and AC-110484) with selective agonist activity at the V(2) receptor. One of these compounds, AC-94544, displayed over 180-fold selectivity at the V(2) receptor compared to related vasopressin and oxytocin receptors and no activity at 28 other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). All three compounds also showed partial agonist activity at the V(2) receptor in a cAMP accumulation assay. In addition, in a rat model of central diabetes insipidus, AC-94544 was able to significantly reduce urine output in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, AC-94544, AC-88324, and AC-110484 represent novel opportunities for the treatment of disorders associated with V(2) receptor agonist deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Gallium, a pharmacologically important metal which resembles iron, was shown in previous studies to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. To better understand its mechanism of action, we have examined the interaction of gallium with the iron-dependent M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. In its active form, M2 contains an iron center and a tyrosyl free radical which is detectable by ESR spectroscopy. In the present study, cytoplasmic extracts prepared from murine leukemic L1210 cells after an 18-hr incubation with 960 microM gallium nitrate displayed a &gt; 60% inhibition in their M2 tyrosyl radical ESR signal. However, this signal was restored within 15 min to levels greater than that of controls by the addition of increasing concentrations of ferrous ammonium sulfate. Gallium citrate added directly to cytoplasmic extracts from control cells also decreased the tyrosyl radical signal, an effect which could be reversed by iron. Immunoblot analysis revealed that incubation with gallium did not diminish the amount of M2 protein in cells, thus indicating that the decrease in the tyrosyl radical signal was not due to a decrease in cellular M2 content. In immunoprecipitation studies of 59Fe-labeled M2, gallium displaced 55-60% of the 59Fe incorporated into M2. Our studies suggest that gallium displaces iron from the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in a loss of the tyrosyl radical and an accumulation of inactive M2 within the cell.",

Using these cell lines, the specificity of each transporter toward agents that inhibit substrate influx and stimulate substrate efflux across the plasma membrane was examined. With 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium as a substrate for DAT and NET and serotonin as a substrate for the serotonin transporter, each transporter demonstrated a distinct pattern of inhibition by a panel of amphetamine derivatives and analogs, including amphetamine, methamphetamine (also known as \"ecstasy\"), p-chloroamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylphenidate (ritalin), and 5-methoxy-6-methyl-2-aminoindan. For each cell line expressing a single biogenic amine transporter, efflux of the accumulated substrate was stimulated by amphetamine derivatives, and this efflux was blocked by mazindol, an inhibitor of all three transporters. Of the amphetamine derivatives tested, some caused efflux at concentrations similar to those that inhibited transport. Other derivatives were much less effective at stimulating efflux than at inhibiting uptake. Methylphenidate caused little or no efflux, although it blocked uptake mediated by both NET and DAT. Other inhibitors of transport, such as cocaine, mazindol, citalopram, and nisoxetine, failed to stimulate efflux from these cells at concentrations that inhibited influx. The results suggest that potency toward individual plasma membrane biogenic amine transporters and the ability to release accumulated amine substrates are independent properties of each amphetamine derivative.",

We have focused our attention on the regulation of glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT-4) expression in human skeletal muscle. 2. Glucose transporter isoform 4 gene expression is increased immediately following a single bout of exercise, and the GLUT-4 enhancer factor (GEF) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors are required for this response. Glucose transporter isoform enhancer factor and MEF2 DNA binding activities are increased following exercise, and the molecular mechanisms regulating MEF2 in exercising human skeletal muscle have also been examined. 3. These studies find possible roles for histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in regulating MEF2 through a series of complex interactions potentially involving MEF2 repression, coactivation and phosphorylation. 4. Given that MEF2 is a transcription factor required for many exercise responsive genes, it is possible that these mechanisms are responsible for regulating the expression of a variety of metabolic genes during exercise. These mechanisms could also provide targets for the treatment and management of metabolic disease states, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, which are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "Non-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes (ie, isoforms A and B) in the brain are associated with clinically significant antidepressant effects. In the US, the selegiline transdermal system (STS; EMSAM) is the first antidepressant transdermal delivery system to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved labeling for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Currently, the use of orally administered MAO inhibitor antidepressants (eg, phenelzine, tranylcypromine) is limited by the risk of tyramine-provoked events (eg, acute hypertension and headache, also known as the \"cheese reaction\") when combined with dietary tyramine. The selegiline transdermal system is the only MAOI available in the US for the treatment of MDD that does not require dietary restriction at the clinically effective dose of 6 mg/24 hours. Delivery of selegiline transdermally (EMSAM((R))) bypasses hepatic first pass metabolism, thereby avoiding significant inhibition of gastrointestinal and hepatic MAO-A activity (ie, reduced risk of tyramine-provoked events) while still providing sufficient levels of selegiline in the brain to produce an antidepressant effect. At dosages of 6-12 mg/24 hours, EMSAM has been shown to improve symptoms of depression, have good tolerability, and have high rates of medication adherence. However, at higher doses of EMSAM (ie, 9 mg/24 hours or more), dietary restriction of tyramine intake is recommended. The introduction of EMSAM overcomes many of the safety concerns affiliated with the conventional oral MAO inhibitors and EMSAM may be considered another strategy for the treatment of MDD, especially in patients who cannot tolerate oral antidepressants, are poorly adherent, who present with atypical depressive symptoms, or have failed other antidepressants.",

    "abstract": "The metabolism of tresperimus, a new immunosuppressive agent, was investigated in vivo and in vitro in rat and in human. Two metabolic pathways were identified at each side of the molecule with two deamination reactions on the spermidine moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bond leading to the liberation of guanidinohexylamine. As the major metabolic pathway of the drug seemed to be the oxidative deamination, the capacity of different amine oxidases to metabolize tresperimus was then tested using in vivo experiments in rat and in vitro studies in rat and human plasma. The increase of tresperimus plasma levels induced by the administration of hydralazine, an irreversible in vivo inhibitor of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), reflected the major involvement of this enzyme in tresperimus metabolism. This result was confirmed in vitro in rat and human plasma by the use of semicarbazide, a specific SSAO inhibitor. As opposed to rat plasma, human plasma may be an interesting in vitro model to study the metabolism of a drug extensively metabolized by SSAO such as tresperimus. Indeed, SSAO activity was significantly higher in human plasma than in rat plasma. The second metabolic pathway of the drug, which only occurred in rat plasma, appeared thus as the major route of tresperimus metabolism in this biological matrix.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells have constitutively high expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase (COX) 2. These NSCLC cells also have increased prostaglandin expression (PGE2). Many lung cancers also express 12-lipoxygenase RNA and 12-lipoxygenase protein and biosynthesize 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which correlates with their metastatic potential. Several studies have demonstrated that COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors could inhibit the in vitro growth of human lung cancer cell lines. In this report, we evaluated the growth-inhibitory effects of sulindac sulfide, a COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor; exisulind (sulindac sulfone), a novel proapoptotic agent that does not inhibit COX enzymes; and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor on human lung cancer cell lines. We compared these effects with those of 13-cis-retinoic acid, a chemoprevention agent, and with the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel and cisplatin, alone or in combination. Our goal was to develop new chemoprevention and treatment strategies. Each of the six agents tested inhibited the in vitro growth of three NSCLC and three SCLC cell lines at the highest concentration. Paclitaxel was the most potent agent (IC50 = 0.003-0.150 microM); sulindac sulfide, NDGA, and 13-cis-retinoic acid had intermediate potency (IC50 = 4-80 microM), and cisplatin and exisulind were the least potent (IC50 = 150-500 microM). Combination studies showed synergistic interactions for sulindac sulfide, exisulind, and NDGA with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and 13-cis-retinoic acid, regardless of drug-resistance phenotype. At high concentrations, the combination of 13-cis-retinoic acid and each of the five other drugs resulted in a strong synergistic effect. These studies provide a rationale for chemoprevention (exisulind +/- retinoic acid +/- NDGA) and therapeutic (exisulind +/- paclitaxel +/- cisplatin) studies in patients at risk for, or with, lung cancer.",

It possesses nanomolar potencies in both enzymatic and replicon-based cell culture assays. In rats and dogs this compound demonstrated an oral plasma half-life of greater than 7 h, and its bioavailability was &gt;60%. In monkeys it had a half-life of 1.9 h and 15% bioavailability. Its antiviral efficacy was evaluated in two chimpanzees infected with HCV in a proof-of-concept study. The design included oral dosing of 30 mg per kg of body weight twice a day for 14 days, followed by a 14-day posttreatment observation. Maximum viral load reductions of 1.4 and 2.5 log(10) copies RNA/ml for genotype 1a- and 1b-infected chimpanzees, respectively, were observed within 2 days after the initiation of treatment. After this initial drop in the viral load, a rebound of plasma HCV RNA was observed in the genotype 1b-infected chimpanzee, while the genotype 1a-infected chimpanzee experienced a partial rebound that lasted throughout the treatment period. Clonal analysis of NS5B gene sequences derived from the plasma of A-837093-treated chimpanzees revealed the presence of several mutations associated with resistance to A-837093, including Y448H, G554D, and D559G in the genotype 1a-infected chimpanzee and C316Y and G554D in the genotype 1b-infected chimpanzee. The identification of resistance-associated mutations in both chimpanzees is consistent with the findings of in vitro selection studies, in which many of the same mutations were selected. These findings validate the antiviral efficacy and resistance development of benzothiadiazine HCV polymerase inhibitors in vivo.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Modulation of DNA base excision repair (BER) has the potential to enhance response to chemotherapy and improve outcomes in tumours such as melanoma and glioma. APE1, a critical protein in BER that processes potentially cytotoxic abasic sites (AP sites), is a promising new target in cancer. In the current study, we aimed to develop small molecule inhibitors of APE1 for cancer therapy. METHODS: An industry-standard high throughput virtual screening strategy was adopted. The Sybyl8.0 (Tripos, St Louis, MO, USA) molecular modelling software suite was used to build inhibitor templates. Similarity searching strategies were then applied using ROCS 2.3 (Open Eye Scientific, Santa Fe, NM, USA) to extract pharmacophorically related subsets of compounds from a chemically diverse database of 2.6 million compounds. The compounds in these subsets were subjected to docking against the active site of the APE1 model, using the genetic algorithm-based programme GOLD2.7 (CCDC, Cambridge, UK). Predicted ligand poses were ranked on the basis of several scoring functions. The top virtual hits with promising pharmaceutical properties underwent detailed in vitro analyses using fluorescence-based APE1 cleavage assays and counter screened using endonuclease IV cleavage assays, fluorescence quenching assays and radiolabelled oligonucleotide assays. Biochemical APE1 inhibitors were then subjected to detailed cytotoxicity analyses. RESULTS: Several specific APE1 inhibitors were isolated by this approach. The IC(50) for APE1 inhibition ranged between 30 nM and 50 muM. We demonstrated that APE1 inhibitors lead to accumulation of AP sites in genomic DNA and potentiated the cytotoxicity of alkylating agents in melanoma and glioma cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that APE1 is an emerging drug target and could have therapeutic application in patients with melanoma and glioma.",

We evaluated acetaminophen's effect on PG release and the expression patterns of genes related to PG production in a clinical model of tissue injury and acute inflammation. Subjects (119 outpatients) received either 1000 mg acetaminophen, 50 mg rofecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor), 30 mg ketorolac (a dual COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor), or placebo before the surgical removal of two impacted mandibular third molars. Microdialysis was used to collect inflammatory transudate from the surgical site for measurement of PGE2 and TXB2 levels at the site of injury. Biopsies were collected to investigate the expression patterns of genes related to PG production at baseline prior to surgery and at 3 or 24 h following surgery. PGE2 release was suppressed by ketorolac, rofecoxib and acetaminophen compared to placebo at 3 h coincident with increased COX-2 gene expression in biopsies collected from the surgical site. TXB2 release was suppressed only by ketorolac. COX-2 gene expression remained elevated at 24 h with continued ketorolac and acetaminophen treatment. COX-1 gene expression was significantly down-regulated at 24 h by ketorolac, rofecoxib and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen suppression of PGE2 without inhibiting TXB2 release, when COX-2 gene expression is up-regulated, suggests that acetaminophen is a selective COX-2 inhibitor in vivo. The up-regulation of COX-2 gene and down-regulation of COX-1 gene expression suggests that acetaminophen may result in changes in COX-derived prostanoids with repeated doses.",

    "title": "Quadruple nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors-only regimen of tenofovir plus zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir in heavily pre-treated HIV-1 infected patients: salvage therapy or backbone only?",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We investigated the virologic and immunologic responses to a mono-class, nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor - combination therapy consisting of tenofovir and zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir in therapy experienced patients. METHODS: Retrospective study of 122 patients. Primary analysis was performed at 48 weeks. Virologic response was defined as viral load levels less than 400 copies/ml. RESULTS: About half of the patients had switched to tenofovir+ zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir for simplification purposes or toxicity while the other half had experienced virologic failure. 80/122 (66%) responded. Median viral load decreased to 78 copies/ml at week 48; median CD4 count increased to 321 cells/mm(3). Of the 42 virologic failures, only 3 patients failed after week 24. 24/35 patients who had been on a non-suppressive zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir-only regimen at baseline and added tenofovir to intensify, responded. 41/53 patients who switched from any nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-only regimen improved or maintained suppression. Genotypes were available for 85/122 patients. The only predictor of virologic failure was the combination 41L+210W+215Y/F mutational pattern. 16 of the patients who failed on tenofovir+ zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir therapy selected new primary nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutations that they previously did not have. 48/85 (56%) patients with genotype tests had at least 3 (3-10; median 4) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance-associated mutations in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Patients heavily pre-treated with nucleoside analogues may show response to mono-class tenofovir+ zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir therapy despite having a history of failure with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Lower baseline viral load, higher baseline CD4 count were significant predictors for response. Archived 41L+210W+215Y/F mutational pattern was significantly associated with non-response.",

    "title": "Phenylbutazone in the horse: a review.",
    "abstract": "Phenylbutazone is an acidic, lipophilic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is extensively metabolized in the horse. The metabolites so far identified, oxyphenbutazone, gamma-hydroxyoxyphenbutazone, account for some 25-30% of administered dose over 24 h. The plasma half-life of phenylbutazone and termination of its pharmacological action are determined primarily by its rate of hepatic metabolism. Phenylbutazone acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme system, which is responsible for synthesis of prostanoids such as PGE2. It appears to act on prostaglandin-H synthase and prostacyclin synthase, after conversion by prostaglandin-H synthase to reactive intermediates. It markedly reduces prostanoid-dependent swelling, edema, erythema, and hypersensitivity to pain in inflamed tissues. Its principal use in the horse is for treatment of soft tissue inflammation. Phenylbutazone is highly bound (greater than 98%) to plasma protein. After i.v. injection, blood levels decline with an elimination half-life of 3-10 h. The plasma kinetics of phenylbutazone may be dose dependent, with the plasma half-life increasing as the drug dosage level increases. Plasma residues of the drug at 24 h after a single i.v. dose of 2 g/450 kg average about 0.9 microgram/ml, but considerable variation occurs. If dosing is repeated, the plasma residue accumulates to give mean residual blood levels of approximately 4.5 microgram/ml on Day 5 after 4 days of dosing. Approximately similar blood levels are found after a combination of oral and i.v. dosing. Experiments on large numbers of horses in training have been undertaken to ascertain the population distributions of residual blood levels after such dosing schedules. Absorption of phenylbutazone from the gastrointestinal tract is influenced by the dose administered and the relationship of dosing to feeding. Access to hay can delay the time of peak plasma concentration to 18 h or longer. Under optimal conditions, the bioavailability of oral phenylbutazone is probably in the region of 70%. Paste preparations may be more slowly absorbed than other preparations and yield higher residual plasma levels at 24 h after dosing, but further controlled studies are required. Phenylbutazone is easily detected in the plasma and urine of horses but concentrations in saliva are low. It is quantitated for forensic purposes by HPLC. The variability of this method between laboratories is about +/- 25%. Increasing urinary pH increases the urinary concentration of phenylbutazone and its metabolites up to 200-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

AZD3514 modulates AR signaling through two distinct mechanisms, an inhibition of ligand-driven nuclear translocation of AR and a downregulation of receptor levels, both of which were observed in vitro and in vivo. AZD3514 inhibited testosterone-driven seminal vesicle development in juvenile male rats and the growth of androgen-dependent Dunning R3327H prostate tumors in adult rats. Furthermore, this class of compound showed antitumor activity in the HID28 mouse model of CRPC in vivo. AZD3514 is currently in phase I clinical evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The front-line antituberculosis drug isoniazid (INH) and the related drug ethionamide (ETH) are prodrugs that upon activation inhibit the synthesis of mycolic acids, leading to bactericidal activity. Coresistance to INH and ETH can be mediated by dominant mutations in the target gene inhA, encoding an enoyl-ACP reductase, or by recessive mutations in ndh, encoding a type II NADH dehydrogenase (NdhII). To address the mechanism of resistance mediated by the latter, we have isolated novel ndh mutants of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The M. smegmatis ndh mutants were highly resistant to INH and ETH, while the M. bovis BCG mutants had low-level resistance to INH and ETH. All mutants had defects in NdhII activity resulting in an increase in intracellular NADH/NAD(+) ratios. Increasing NADH levels were shown to protect InhA against inhibition by the INH-NAD adduct formed upon INH activation. We conclude that ndh mutations mediate a novel mechanism of resistance by increasing the NADH cellular concentration, which competitively inhibits the binding of INH-NAD or ETH-NAD adduct to InhA.",

At 24 degrees C normal human lymphocytes had 6000 binding sites/cell and a dissociation constant of 4 x 10(-9) M. The administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone, 5 mg of prednisone, and 37.5 mg of cortisone acetate resulted in a 30% decrease in binding sites after 1 week with no change in binding affinity. No changes in the number of binding sites was noted before 1 week and the diminished number persisted for 1 week after discontinuation of glucocorticoid treatment. Lymphocytes from hospitalized patients taking 40-60 mg of dexamethasone daily demonstrated the same change in number of binding sites that was seen in normal subjects taking 1 mg of dexamethasone. When binding assays were carried out at physiologic temperature there was the same decrease in number of binding sites after dexamethasone administration, and in addition, there was a two-fold increase in binding affinity. Glucocorticoid administration results in a time-dependent decrease in the number of lymphocyte glucocorticoid binding sites that is independent of the type of glucocorticoid administered.

    "abstract": "1. Thymidylate synthase (TS), the key enzyme in de novo synthesis of thymidine, is an important target for antitumour chemotherapy. It was hypothesized that antisense oligonucleotide down-regulation of TS mRNA would decrease TS levels and enhance the cytotoxicity of inhibitors of TS, including the pyrimidine analogues 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FUdR), and the folate analogue Tomudex (ICI D1694; N-(5-[N-(3, 4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylamino ]-2-theon yl-L-glutamic acid). 2. 2'-Methoxyethoxylated, phosphorothioated 20-mer oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), complementary to various sequences in TS mRNA, were synthesized, along with control oligomers consisting of the same, respective bases in randomized order, against which all the biological effects were compared. Following a 6-h transfection of HeLa cells using polycationic liposome at 3 microg ml(-1), ODN 83 (50 nM), complementary to a region in the 3'-untranslated region of the TS mRNA, decreased TS mRNA levels by approximately 70% within 24 h. ODN 83 also decreased TS enzyme activity, as measured by binding of TS to radiolabelled 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate. In addition to inhibiting proliferation by up to approximately 40%, ODN 83 enhanced the cytotoxicity of Tomudex or 5-FU, added 1 day following transfection, by 50 - 60%. ODN 83 also enhanced sensitivity to 5-FUdR by 70%, but did not affect the toxicity of cisplatin, chlorambucil, melphalan, doxorubicin, ionizing radiation, paclitaxel, or irinotecan. 3. These data indicate that antisense ODN down-regulation of TS can inhibit human tumour cell proliferation and enhance the efficacy of TS-targeted drugs.",

    "abstract": "Natural (all trans-retinoic acid, RA) and synthetic retinoids exhibit potent anti-proliferative, normalization of differentiation and anti-inflammatory activities which appear to account for their therapeutic effects in acne, psoriasis, photoaging, precancerous lesions and established cancers. Although RA has shown considerable promise in dermatologic indications, certain side effects have restricted its use as a choice of agent for chronic administration. Systematic synthesis of receptor-selective retinoids has resulted in two topical drugs, Tazorac/Zorac (tazarotene) and Differin (adapalene). Tazorac is indicated for psoriasis and acne and Differin gel for the treatment of acne. These drugs bind to the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family members. Various RAR subtype-specific and function-selective retinoids have been synthesized. These retinoids, which are in various stages of pre-clinical development for the treatment of cancers, psoriasis and as an antidote to Accutane-mediated mucocutaneous toxicity, will also be discussed in this review. Discovery of another retinoid receptor, retinoid X receptor (RXR), revealed that RXR-specific retinoids already existed in retinoid chemical libraries. Structure activity relationship studies based upon binding and transactivation assays led to the synthesis of RXR-specific ligands with high affinities for RXR subtypes. These compounds were found to be effective in the treatment of hyperglycemia in animal models of type II diabetes. The discovery of novel retinoids along with an increased understanding of the biological functions and mechanisms of action of retinoid receptors are likely to result in improved treatments for existing responsive indications and identification of new retinoid therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "GW572016 (Lapatinib) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in clinical development for cancer that is a potent dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB-1) and ErbB-2. We determined the crystal structure of EGFR bound to GW572016. The compound is bound to an inactive-like conformation of EGFR that is very different from the active-like structure bound by the selective EGFR inhibitor OSI-774 (Tarceva) described previously. Surprisingly, we found that GW572016 has a very slow off-rate from the purified intracellular domains of EGFR and ErbB-2 compared with OSI-774 and another EGFR selective inhibitor, ZD-1839 (Iressa). Treatment of tumor cells with these inhibitors results in down-regulation of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. We evaluated the duration of the drug effect after washing away free compound and found that the rate of recovery of receptor phosphorylation in the tumor cells reflected the inhibitor off-rate from the purified intracellular domain. The slow off-rate of GW572016 correlates with a prolonged down-regulation of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cells. The differences in the off-rates of these drugs and the ability of GW572016 to inhibit ErbB-2 can be explained by the enzyme-inhibitor structures.",

In cellular assays, lumiracoxib had an IC(50) of 0.14 microM in COX-2-expressing dermal fibroblasts, but caused no inhibition of COX-1 at concentrations up to 30 microM (HEK 293 cells transfected with human COX-1). 3.

Lumiracoxib was rapidly absorbed following oral administration in rats with peak plasma levels being reached between 0.5 and 1 h. 5. Ex vivo, lumiracoxib inhibited COX-1-derived thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) generation with an ID(50) of 33 mg kg(-1), whereas COX-2-derived production of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated rat air pouch was inhibited with an ID(50) value of 0.24 mg kg(-1). 6. Efficacy of lumiracoxib in rat models of hyperalgesia, oedema, pyresis and arthritis was dose-dependent and similar to diclofenac. However, consistent with its low COX-1 inhibitory activity, lumiracoxib at a dose of 100 mg kg(-1) orally caused no ulcers and was significantly less ulcerogenic than diclofenac (P&lt;0.05). 7. Lumiracoxib is a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities comparable with diclofenac, the reference NSAID, but with much improved gastrointestinal safety.",

Ghrelin- and glucagon receptor-immunoreactive cells were detected in lamina propria mucosae of stomach and some cells expressed both. Intravenous administration of glucagon caused transient increases in both acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin levels in the gastric vein within 10 min, which was followed by gradual increases in desacyl-ghrelin levels until 60 min. Steady state levels of ghrelin mRNA in the stomach were increased by 1.9-fold 20 min after glucagon administration, but not at 5 or 120 min. These results suggest that glucagon stimulates acute release of both forms of ghrelin and thereafter upregulates synthesis and release of desacyl-ghrelin in the rat stomach.",

N-Desalkylquetiapine had a high affinity (3.4 nM) for the histamine H(1) receptor and moderate affinities (10-100 nM) for the norepinephrine reuptake transporter (NET), the serotonin 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1E), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B), 5-HT(7) receptors, the alpha(1B)-adrenergic receptor, and the M(1), M(3), and M(5) muscarinic receptors. The compound had low affinities (100-1000 nM) for the 5-HT(1D), 5-HT(2C), 5-HT(3), 5-HT(5), 5-HT(6), alpha(1A), alpha(2A), alpha(2B), alpha(2C), H(2), M(2), M(4), and dopamine D(1), D(2), D(3), and D(4) receptors. N-Desalkylquetiapine potently inhibited human NE transporter with a K(i) of 12 nM, about 100-fold more potent than quetiapine itself. N-Desalkylquetiapine was also 10-fold more potent and more efficacious than quetiapine at the 5-HT(1A) receptor. N-Desalkylquetiapine was an antagonist at 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B), 5-HT(2C), alpha(1A), alpha(1D), alpha(2A), alpha(2C), H(1), M(1), M(3), and M(5) receptors. In the mouse tail suspension test, N-Desalkylquetiapine displayed potent antidepressant-like activity in VMAT2 heterozygous mice at doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg. These data strongly suggest that the antidepressant activity of quetiapine is mediated, at least in part, by its metabolite N-Desalkylquetiapine through NET inhibition and partial 5-HT(1A) agonism. Possible contributions of this metabolite to the side effects of quetiapine are discussed.",

The concentration of BRL 42715 needed to reduce the initial rate of hydrolysis of most beta-lactamase enzymes by 50% was less than 0.01 micrograms/ml, which was 10- to 100-fold lower than for other beta-lactamase inhibitors. These potent inhibitory activities were reflected in the low concentrations of BRL 42715 needed to potentiate the antibacterial activity of beta-lactamase-susceptible beta-lactams. Concentrations of 0.25 micrograms/ml or less considerably enhanced the activity of amoxicillin against many beta-lactamase-producing strains. The MIC50 (MIC for 50% of strains tested) of amoxicillin for 412 beta-lactamase-producing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae fell from greater than 128 to 2 micrograms/ml in the presence of 1 microgram of BRL 42715 per ml, whereas 5 micrograms of clavulanic acid per ml brought the MIC50 down to 8 micrograms/ml. Among these 412 strains were 73 Citrobacter and Enterobacter strains, and 1 microgram of BRL 42715 per ml reduced the MIC50 of amoxicillin from greater than 128 to 2 micrograms/ml for the 48 cefotaxime-susceptible strains and from greater than 128 to 8 micrograms/ml for the 25 cefotaxime-resistant strains.",

    "abstract": "Fumarate reductase (FRD) is the key enzyme in fumarate respiration induced by anaerobic growth of bacteria. In Helicobacter pylori, this enzyme appears to be constitutively expressed under microaerobic conditions and is not essential for its survival in vitro. In this study, the role of FRD in the colonization of H. pylori was investigated using a mouse model. The frdA gene coding for subunit A of FRD, and two control genes, copA and copP associated with the export of copper out of H. pylori, were inactivated by insertion of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cassette into these individual genes. The isogenic mutants of H. pylori strain AH244 were obtained by natural transformation. Seventy-five ICR mice (15 mice/group) were orogastrically dosed with either the wild type H. pylori strain AH244, its isogenic mutants, or Brucella broth (negative control). Five mice from each group were killed at 2, 4 and 8 weeks post-inoculation (WPI), respectively. H. pylori colonization was not detected in mouse gastric mucosa infected with the frdA mutant at any time point in the study by both quantitative culture and PCR. In contrast, the mice inoculated with either wild type AH244, copA or copPH. pylori mutants became readily infected. These data indicate that FRD plays a crucial role in H. pylori survival in the gastric mucosa of mice. Given that FRD, present in all H. pylori strains, is immunogenic in H. pylori -infected patients and H. pylori growth in vitro can be inhibited by three anthelmintics (morantel, oxantel and thiabendazole), this enzyme could potentially be used both as a novel drug target as well as in the development of vaccines for H. pylori prevention and eradication.",

The active metabolite appears to inhibit viral reverse transcriptase and terminate the proviral DNA, and produces virustatic inhibition of actively replicating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at clinically relevant concentrations. In phase I studies didanosine had beneficial effects on various surrogate markers of clinical efficacy and also improved clinical manifestations of HIV infection, with a 21-month survival rate of 80% in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 93% in patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) in 1 study. Didanosine also improved CD4+ cell counts in a phase II/III trial in patients previously treated with zidovudine, whereas cell counts declined in patients continuing zidovudine therapy. However, the effects of didanosine on clinical end-points (disease progression, survival, HIV encephalopathy) remain to be established. Peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis are the predominant dose-limiting adverse events and didanosine therapy should be withdrawn in patients developing signs or symptoms of pancreatitis and during acute treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. However, at currently recommended clinical dosages didanosine is generally well tolerated with minimal haematological toxicity. Thus, in a therapeutic area with few treatment options, didanosine offers a welcome alternative for patients intolerant of, or resistant to, zidovudine. There are a number of clinical trials in progress evaluating didanosine alone or in combination with other antiviral agents, and these results are awaited with considerable interest.",

    "abstract": "Nicorandil is a new antianginal agent that potentially may be used to treat the cardiovascular side effects of diabetes. It is both a nitric oxide donor and an opener of ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels in muscle and thereby causes vasodilation of the coronary vasculature. The aim of this study was to investigate the domains of the K(ATP) channel involved in nicorandil activity and to determine whether nicorandil interacts with hypoglycemic sulfonylureas that target K(ATP) channels in pancreatic beta-cells. K(ATP) channels in muscle and beta-cells share a common pore-forming subunit, Kir6.2, but possess alternative sulfonylurea receptors (SURs; SUR1 in beta-cells, SUR2A in cardiac muscle, and SUR2B in smooth muscle). We expressed recombinant K(ATP) channels in Xenopus oocytes and measured the effects of drugs and nucleotides by recording macroscopic currents in excised membrane patches. Nicorandil activated Kir6.2/SUR2A and Kir6.2/SUR2B but not Kir6.2/SUR1 currents, consistent with its specificity for cardiac and smooth muscle K(ATP) channels. Drug activity depended on the presence of intracellular nucleotides and was impaired when the Walker A lysine residues were mutated in either nucleotide-binding domain of SUR2. Chimeric studies showed that the COOH-terminal group of transmembrane helices (TMs), especially TM 17, is responsible for the specificity of nicorandil for channels containing SUR2. The splice variation between SUR2A and SUR2B altered the off-rate of the nicorandil response. Finally, we showed that nicorandil activity was unaffected by gliclazide, which specifically blocks SUR1-type K(ATP) channels, but was severely impaired by glibenclamide and glimepiride, which target both SUR1 and SUR2-type K(ATP) channels.",

Using [1-14C-acetyl]CAR and [3H-methylcarbamoyloxy]CAR, three CAR degradation products were identified: product A, N-(methylcarbamoyloxy)acetamide; product B: N-(methylcarbamoyloxy)-N'-methylurea; and product C: N-hydroxy-N'-methylurea. CAR degradation in human plasma was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to occur in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. A 30-min incubation (37 degrees) of CAR (10(-4) M) with human plasma resulted in degradation of more than 55% of parent compound; at 1 hr, more than 75% of original CAR was degraded. Incubation of [1-14C-acetyl]CAR with rat brain homogenate resulted in the formation of 14CO2. This reaction was partially inhibited by coincubation with physostigmine (10(-3) M). CAR inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in neuroblastoma cells with an IC50 of 14 microM. In mechanism of action studies, CAR was found to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity but only at nine times the IC50 of hydroxyurea. In contrast to hydroxyurea, CAR was found to be non-cell-cycle phase-specific and non-cross-resistant with two CHO cell lines resistant to hydroxyurea. These data demonstrate the instability of CAR; moreover, they suggest that its mechanism of cytotoxicity is distinctly different from that of hydroxyurea and that the neurotoxicity associated with CAR administration may be caused in part by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity.",

Since cPLA(2)alpha and FAAH possess several common structural features, we now screened this substance series together with some new derivatives for FAAH inhibition. Some of the assayed compounds proved to be selective cPLA(2)alpha inhibitors, while others showed high FAAH and moderate cPLA(2)alpha inhibitory potency. Furthermore, several derivatives were favorably active against both enzymes and, therefore, could represent agents, which have improved analgetic and anti-inflammatory qualities in comparison with selective cPLA(2)alpha and FAAH inhibitors.",

Furthermore, we show that PXR regulates the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis, transport, and metabolism of bile acids including cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and the Na(+)-independent organic anion transporter 2 (Oatp2). Finally, we demonstrate that activation of PXR protects against severe liver damage induced by LCA. Based on these data, we propose that PXR serves as a physiological sensor of LCA, and coordinately regulates gene expression to reduce the concentrations of this toxic bile acid.

METHODS: The present study examines the metabolism of 3,4-dimethoxy-2-phenylethylamine in vitro and in freshly prepared and cryopreserved guinea pig liver slices and the relative contribution of different aldehyde-oxidizing enzymes was estimated by pharmacological means. RESULTS: 3,4-Dimethoxy-2- phenylethylamine was converted into the corresponding aldehyde when incubated with monoamine oxidase and further oxidized into the acid when incubated with both, monoamine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. In freshly prepared and cryopreserved liver slices, 3,4-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid was the main metabolite of 3,4-dimethoxy-2- phenylethylamine. 3,4-Dimethoxyphenylacetic acid formation was inhibited by 85% from disulfiram (aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor) and by 75-80% from isovanillin (aldehyde oxidase inhibitor), whereas allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor) inhibited acid formation by only 25-30%.

This study compared the effects of OHT and trilostane, in the presence of 17beta-oestradiol (E2) on gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using microarrays each representing nearly 20,000 human genes. Striking differences between the sets of genes affected by these two drugs were observed. Both OHT and trilostane affected transcription of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell adhesion and matrix formation, however, only 12.5% of trilostane down-regulated genes and 9.2% of up-regulated genes were similarly regulated by OHT. A selective up-regulation of ERbeta by trilostane, but not OHT, was observed and confirmed by qRT-PCR. Similar up-regulation of this gene by trilostane was observed in the uterus of trilostane-treated (4 mg/kg for 7 days) rats, in which ERbeta mRNA (3-fold) and ERbeta protein expression (10-fold) were both increased. These data show that OHT and trilostane regulate the expression of different sets of genes, reflecting their different modes of interaction with ER. Trilostane-specific up-regulation of ERbeta could explain its positive benefit rates in acquired tamoxifen resistance.",

    "title": "Molecular docking reveals a novel binding site model for fentanyl at the mu-opioid receptor.",
    "abstract": "The ligand binding modes of a series of fentanyl derivatives are examined using a combination of conformational analysis and molecular docking to the mu-opioid receptor. Condensed-phase molecular dynamics simulations are applied to evaluate potential relationships between ligand conformation and fentanyl substitution and to generate probable \"bioactive\" structures for the ligand series. Automated docking of the largely populated solution conformers identified a common binding site orientation that places the N-phenethyl group of fentanyl deep in a crevice between transmembrane (TM) helices II and III while the N-phenylpropanamide group projected toward a pocket formed by TM-III, -VI, and -VII domains. An analysis of the binding modes indicates the most potent fentanyl derivatives adopt an extended conformation both in solution and in the bound state, suggesting binding affinity may depend on the conformational preferences of the ligands. The results are consistent with ligand binding data derived from chimeric and mutant receptor studies as well as structure-activity relationship data reported on a wide range of fentanyl analogues. The binding site model is also compared to that of N-phenethylnormorphine. An overlay of the bound conformation of the opiate and cis-3-methylfentanyl shows the N-phenethyl groups occupy equivalent binding domains in the receptor. While the cationic amines of both ligand classes were found docked to an established anchor site (D149 in TM-III), no overlap was observed between the N-phenylpropanamide group and the remaining components of the opiate scaffold. The unique binding mode(s) proposed for the fentanyl series may, in part, explain the difficulties encountered in defining models of recognition at the mu-receptor and suggest opioid receptors may display multiple binding epitopes. Furthermore, the results provide new insight to the design of experiments aimed at understanding the structural basis to the differential selectivities of ligands at the mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors.",

    "abstract": "Modafinil is a mild psychostimulant used for the treatment of sleep and arousal-related disorders, and has been considered a pharmacotherapy for cocaine and amphetamine dependence; however, modafinil's mechanism of action is largely unclear. The present study investigated modafinil using drug discrimination and slice superfusion techniques. Rats were trained to discriminate cocaine (1.6 or 5 mg/kg) or amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg) from saline injection for food reinforcement. Modafinil (64-128 mg/kg) substituted partially for both cocaine doses and amphetamine. Pretreatment with a lower modafinil dose (32 mg/kg) augmented the discriminative stimulus properties of cocaine (1.6 mg/kg dose group) and amphetamine. In neurochemical experiments, modafinil (100-300 microM) evoked [(3)H]overflow from rat striatal slices preloaded with [(3)H]dopamine in a concentration-dependent manner; however, modafinil was less potent and efficacious than amphetamine and nicotine. The dopamine transporter inhibitor nomifensine (10 microM) blocked modafinil-evoked [(3)H]overflow, and concentrations of modafinil (&lt;100 microM) that did not have intrinsic activity attenuated amphetamine (1 and 3 microM)-evoked [(3)H]overflow. Modafinil-evoked [(3)H]overflow was not altered by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist mecamylamine, and modafinil did not alter nicotine-evoked [(3)H]overflow, indicating that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors likely are not important for modafinil's mechanism of action. The present results indicate that modafinil evokes dopamine release from striatal neurons and is a psychostimulant that is pharmacologically similar to, but much less potent and efficacious than, amphetamine.",

    "abstract": "A series of 8-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanes (isotropanes) were synthesized and tested for inhibitor potency using [(3)H]WIN 35,428 binding at the dopamine (DA) transporter, [(3)H]citalopram binding at the serotonin (5-HT) transporter, and [(3)H]DA uptake assays. The synthesis started with a Mannich condensation of cyclopentanone, benzylamine, and fomaldehyde to afford N-benzyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-one (6). The 8-phenyl group was introduced by Grignard addition to ketone 6 or nucleophilic displacement via a triflate of the corresponding alcohol 7a. The 8beta-phenyl-8alpha-alcohols from Grignard addition generally have low affinity for the two transporters and do not effectively inhibit the uptake of [(3)H]DA. The 8beta-phenyl compound (14) without the hydroxyl group at C-8 was much more potent (22-fold) for [(3)H]WIN 35,428 binding inhibition than the corresponding 8beta-phenyl-8alpha-hydroxy compound (7a). The 8alpha-phenyl compound 8a was almost as potent as cocaine in binding to the DA transporter (IC(50) = 234 nM vs 159 nM for cocaine), whereas the C-8 epimer, compound 14, was somewhat less potent (IC(50) = 785 nM). The lower potency of 14 (beta-orientation of 8-phenyl group) as compared to 8a (alpha-orientation) was unexpected, based on modeling studies comparing the new compounds to WIN 35,065-2, an analogue of cocaine. The benzhydryl ethers at C-8 (17), analogous to the benztropines, had better selectivity than the corresponding phenyl compounds, 8a and 14, for the DA transporter as compared to the 5-HT transporter. The isotropane and benzisotropine analogues seem to bind in a manner that is more similar to that of the benztropine compounds 5 rather than those of cocaine and WIN 35,065-2.",

    "abstract": "Zonisamide is a synthetic 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide with anticonvulsant properties. The sulfamoyl group on zonisamide was expected to suppress seizures in a manner similar to another sulfonamide analogue, acetazolamide, through inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. However, this does not appear to be the primary mechanism of action since zonisamide requires much higher doses than acetazolamide to achieve equivalent titration in vivo. Studies with cultured neurons indicate that zonisamide blocks repetitive firing of voltage-sensitive sodium channels and reduces voltage-sensitive T-type calcium currents without affecting L-type calcium currents. Its dual mechanism of action may explain its efficacy in patients resistant to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Zonisamide has a pharmacokinetic profile favorable for clinical use. It is rapidly and completely absorbed and has a long half-life (63-69h in healthy volunteers) which allows twice-daily, or even once-daily, dosing. Zonisamide is not highly bound to plasma proteins. Consequently, it does not affect protein binding of other highly protein-bound AEDs. Furthermore, zonisamide does not induce its own metabolism and does not induce liver enzymes. However, since zonisamide is metabolized by cytochrome P450, liver enzyme-inducing AEDs will increase zonisamide clearance, and dosage adjustments may be necessary when it is used in combination with certain AEDs.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene, CHRNA7, is associated with genetic transmission of schizophrenia and related cognitive and neurophysiological sensory gating deficits. Cognitive dysfunction is responsible for significant psychosocial disability in schizophrenia. Nicotine, a low-potency agonist at the alpha7 receptor, has some positive effects on neurophysiological and neurocognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, which suggests that more effective receptor activation might meaningfully enhance cognition in schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: To determine if 3-[(2,4-dimethoxy)benzylidene]anabaseine (DMXB-A), a natural alkaloid derivative and a partial alpha7 nicotinic cholinergic agonist, significantly improves neurocognition, and to assess, by effects on P50 auditory evoked potential inhibition, whether its neurobiological actions are consistent with activation of alpha7 nicotinic receptors. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind crossover trial of 2 drug doses and 1 placebo. SETTING: General clinical research center. PATIENTS: Twelve persons with schizophrenia who did not smoke and were concurrently treated with antipsychotic drugs. One person was withdrawn because of a transient decrease in white blood cell count. INTERVENTION: Administration of DMXB-A. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total scale score of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status and P50 inhibitory gating. RESULTS: Significant neurocognitive improvement was found on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status total scale score, particularly for the lower DMXB-A dose compared with placebo. Effects were greater than those of nicotine in a similar study. Significant improvement in P50 inhibition also occurred. Patients generally tolerated the drug well. CONCLUSIONS: An alpha7 nicotinic agonist appears to have positive effects on neurocognition in persons with schizophrenia. Longer trials are needed to determine the clinical utility of this novel treatment strategy.",

    "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder of childhood. Recent research indicates that ADHD most often persists into adolescence and adulthood, and is associated with impairments in academic, social and occupational functioning. The ADHD diagnosis is based on history and clinical examination. There are no objective laboratory measures for diagnosis. ADHD is largely heritable. Its underlying pathophysiology has been theorised to include dysregulation of inhibitory noradrenergic frontocortical activity on dopaminergic striatal structures. Evidence shows that ADHD is highly responsive to pharmacological treatments resulting in global functional improvements. Although pharmacotherapy is recognised as the most effective treatment, additional components to optimise ADHD management include proper educational placement, parent management training and social skills development. Central nervous system stimulants, specifically methylphenidate and amphetamine, remain first-line pharmacological treatments. Atomoxetine, a selective noradrenergic re-uptake inhibitor, is the first non-stimulant compound to receive FDA approval for paediatric and adult ADHD. Other medication classes, including alpha-agonist antihypertensives, tricyclic antidepressants, other antidepressants such as buproprion, and the wake-promoting agent modafinil, are prescribed in off-label therapy. Ongoing development of new ADHD medications is expected to emphasise alternative and extended-release delivery systems and non-stimulant compounds.",

    "title": "Fast- or slow-inactivated state preference of Na+ channel inhibitors: a simulation and experimental study.",
    "abstract": "Sodium channels are one of the most intensively studied drug targets. Sodium channel inhibitors (e.g., local anesthetics, anticonvulsants, antiarrhythmics and analgesics) exert their effect by stabilizing an inactivated conformation of the channels. Besides the fast-inactivated conformation, sodium channels have several distinct slow-inactivated conformational states. Stabilization of a slow-inactivated state has been proposed to be advantageous for certain therapeutic applications. Special voltage protocols are used to evoke slow inactivation of sodium channels. It is assumed that efficacy of a drug in these protocols indicates slow-inactivated state preference. We tested this assumption in simulations using four prototypical drug inhibitory mechanisms (fast or slow-inactivated state preference, with either fast or slow binding kinetics) and a kinetic model for sodium channels. Unexpectedly, we found that efficacy in these protocols (e.g., a shift of the \"steady-state slow inactivation curve\"), was not a reliable indicator of slow-inactivated state preference. Slowly associating fast-inactivated state-preferring drugs were indistinguishable from slow-inactivated state-preferring drugs. On the other hand, fast- and slow-inactivated state-preferring drugs tended to preferentially affect onset and recovery, respectively. The robustness of these observations was verified: i) by performing a Monte Carlo study on the effects of randomly modifying model parameters, ii) by testing the same drugs in a fundamentally different model and iii) by an analysis of the effect of systematically changing drug-specific parameters. In patch clamp electrophysiology experiments we tested five sodium channel inhibitor drugs on native sodium channels of cultured hippocampal neurons. For lidocaine, phenytoin and carbamazepine our data indicate a preference for the fast-inactivated state, while the results for fluoxetine and desipramine are inconclusive. We suggest that conclusions based on voltage protocols that are used to detect slow-inactivated state preference are unreliable and should be re-evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The orexins and their receptors are involved in the regulation of arousal and sleep-wake cycle. Clinical investigation with almorexant has indicated that this dual OX antagonist is efficacious in inducing and maintaining sleep. Using site-directed mutagenesis, beta(2)-adrenergic-based OX(1) and OX(2) modeling, we have determined important molecular determinants of the ligand-binding pocket of OX(1) and OX(2). The conserved residues Asp(45.51), Trp(45.54), Tyr(5.38), Phe(5.42), Tyr(5.47), Tyr(6.48), and His(7.39) were found to be contributing to both orexin-A-binding sites at OX(1) and OX(2). Among these critical residues, five (positions 45.51, 45.54, 5.38, 5.42, and 7.39) were located on the C-terminal strand of the second extracellular loop (ECL2b) and in the top of TM domains at the interface to the main binding crevice, thereby suggesting superficial OX receptor interactions of orexin-A. We found that the mutations W214A(45.54), Y223A(5.38), F227A(5.42), Y317A(6.48), and H350A(7.39) resulted in the complete loss of both [(3)H]almorexant and [(3)H]N-ethyl-2-[(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-(toluene-2-sulfonyl)-amino]-N-pyridin-3-ylmethyl-acetamide (EMPA) binding affinities and also blocked their inhibition of orexin-A-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) response at OX(2). The crucial residues Gln126(3.32), Ala127(3.33), Trp206(45.54), Tyr215(5.38), Phe219(5.42), and His344(7.39) are shared between almorexant and 1-(5-(2-fluoro-phenyl)-2-methyl-thiazol-4-yl)-1-((S)-2-(5-phenyl-(1,3,4)oxadiazol-2-ylmethyl)-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-methanone (SB-674042) binding sites in OX(1). The nonconserved residue at position 3.33 of orexin receptors was identified as occupying a critical position that must be involved in subtype selectivity and also in differentiating two different antagonists for the same receptor. In summary, despite high similarities in the ligand-binding pockets of OX(1) and OX(2) and numerous aromatic/hydrophobic interactions, the local conformation of helix positions 3.32, 3.33, and 3.36 in transmembrane domain 3 and 45.51 in ECL2b provide the structural basis for pharmacologic selectivity between OX(1) and OX(2).",

    "abstract": "The 5-Lipoxygenase pathway results in the formation of leukotrienes, including leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), 5-oxo-6E,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetranoic acid and the cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC(4), LTD(4) and LTE(4)) and activates all four leukotriene receptors, BLT1, BLT2, cysLT(1) and cysLT(2). Zileuton is the only commercially available inhibitor of the 5-Lipoxygenase pathway. In a number of clinical trials, zileuton has been shown to improve airway function and inflammation, asthma symptom control and quality of life in asthmatics. Given the important role that leukotrienes play in airway inflammation, zileuton provides an additional therapeutic option in the management of chronic, persistent asthma, particularly those asthmatics with more severe disease. In addition, zileuton has shown promise in a number of other conditions, including upper airway inflammatory conditions, dermatological disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The development of new formulations, including a controlled release tablet formulation for b.i.d. dosing and an intravenous preparation for acute asthma exacerbations may enhance clinical utility and expand therapeutic indications.",

    "abstract": "We examined the subtype-selective binding site of the beta-adrenergic receptors (betaARs). The beta(1)/beta(2)-chimeric receptors showed the importance of the second and seventh transmembrane domains (TM2 and TM7) of the beta(2)AR for the binding of the beta(2)-selective agonists such as formoterol and procaterol. Alanine-substituted mutants of TM7 of the beta(2)AR showed that Tyr(308,) located at the top of TM7, mainly contributed to beta(2) selectivity. However, Tyr(308) interacted with formoterol and procaterol in two different ways. The results of Ala- and Phe-substituted mutants indicated that the phenyl group of Tyr(308) interacted with the phenyl group in the N-substituent of formoterol (hydrophobic interaction), and the hydroxyl group of Tyr(308) interacted with the protonated amine of procaterol (hydrophilic interaction). In contrast to beta(2)AR, TM2 is a major determinant that beta(1)-selective agonists such as denopamine and T-0509 bound the beta(1)AR with high affinity. Three amino acids (Leu(110), Thr(117), and Val(120)) in TM2 of the beta(1)AR were identified as major determinants for beta(1)-selective binding of these agonists. Three-dimensional models built on the basis of the predicted structure of rhodopsin showed that Tyr(308) of the beta(2)AR covered the binding pocket formed by TM2 and TM7 from the upper side, and Thr(117) of the beta(1)AR located in the middle of the binding pocket to provide a hydrogen bonding for the beta(1)-selective agonists. These data indicate that TM2 and TM7 of the betaAR formed the binding pocket that binds the betaAR subtype-selective agonists with high affinity.",

    "abstract": "Several reports in the literature have described a differential sensitivity to ketolide antibiotics in ermB strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to erythromycin. Strains of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae carrying different erm gene alleles were examined for their susceptibility to the ketolide antibiotics cethromycin (ABT-773) and telithromycin. The effect of the antibiotics on cell growth and viability was assessed as were effects on protein synthesis and 50S ribosomal subunit formation. The susceptibility of wild-type strains of both organisms was compared with effects in strains containing the ermA and ermB methyltransferase genes. A wild-type antibiotic-susceptible strain of S. pyogenes was comparable to an ermA strain of the organism in its ketolide sensitivity, with IC(50) values for 50% inhibition of protein synthesis and 50S ribosomal subunit formation of 10 ng/mL for cethromycin and 16 ng/mL for telithromycin. An S. pneumoniae strain with the ermB gene and an S. pyogenes strain with the ermA gene were also similar in their sensitivity to ketolide inhibition. IC(50) values for inhibition of translation and subunit formation in S. pneumoniae ( ermB) were 30 ng/mL and 55 ng/mL and for the ermA strain of S. pyogenes they were 15 ng/mL and 35 ng/mL respectively. By contrast, an S. pyogenes ermB strain was significantly more resistant to both ketolides, with IC(50) values for inhibition of 50S synthesis of 215 and 380 ng/mL for the two ketolides. Experiments were conducted to examine ribosome synthesis and translational activity in the two ermB strains at intervals during growth in the presence of each antibiotic. Cell viability and 50S subunit formation were dramatically reduced in the S. pneumoniae strain during continued growth with either drug. By contrast, the ketolides had little effect on the S. pyogenes strain growing with the antibiotics. The results indicate that ketolides have a reduced inhibitory effect on translation and 50S subunit synthesis in S. pyogenes with the ermB gene compared with the other strains examined.",

    "abstract": "One of the most important families of antibiotics are the aminoglycosides, including drugs such as neomycin B, paromomycin, gentamicin and streptomycin. With the discovery of the catalytic potential of RNA, these antibiotics became very popular due to their RNA-binding capacity. They serve for the analysis of RNA function as well as for the study of RNA as a potential therapeutic target. Improvements in RNA structure determination recently provided first insights into the decoding site of the ribosome at high resolution and how aminoglycosides might induce misreading of the genetic code. In addition to inhibiting prokaryotic translation, aminoglycosides inhibit several catalytic RNAs such as self-splicing group I introns, RNase P and small ribozymes in vitro. Furthermore, these antibiotics interfere with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication by disrupting essential RNA-protein contacts. Most exciting is the potential of many RNA-binding antibiotics to stimulate RNA activities, conceiving small-molecule partners for the hypothesis of an ancient RNA world. SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) has been used in this evolutionary game leading to small synthetic RNAs, whose NMR structures gave valuable information on how aminoglycosides interact with RNA, which could possibly be used in applied science.",

    "title": "Recombinant hirudin (lepirudin) as anticoagulant in intensive care patients treated with continuous hemodialysis.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recombinant hirudin (lepirudin) is a potent direct thrombin inhibitor, which has been approved for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT). Because the drug is mainly eliminated by the kidneys, a single loading dose of hirudin may induce therapeutic anticoagulation for up to one week in patients with renal insufficiency. Thus, the use of hirudin in critically ill patients with renal failure could markedly increase their bleeding risk. In this study, hirudin was used in critically ill patients with suspected HIT while on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD). METHODS: Hirudin anticoagulation was performed in seven critically ill patients with suspected HIT. Four patients were initially anuric. Three patients had residual renal function. In all 64 CVVHD treatments (mean duration 12 hr), a polysulfone high-flux hemodialyzer (0.75 m2) with a dialysate flow rate of 1.5 liter/hr and an ultrafiltration rate of up to 200 ml/hr was used. Hirudin was given either as continuous intravenous infusion or as repetitive intravenous boli. Monitoring of anticoagulation was performed by measurements of the systemic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). RESULTS: Hirudin dosage had to be individualized according to the risk of bleeding or clotting. During CVVHD, a continuous intravenous infusion (0.006 to 0.025 mg/kg body wt/hr, N = 2) or repetitive intravenous boli (0.007 to 0.04 mg/kg, N = 5) were given. Two patients required blood transfusions prior to and during hirudin treatment. In five patients without a high bleeding risk, the hirudin dose was adjusted to achieve the target aPTT (1.5 to 2.0 x baseline) in order to prevent thrombotic complications or frequent clotting in the extracorporal circuit. Hirudin dose requirements depended on residual renal function and extracorporal clearance. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude from these first clinical data that anticoagulation with hirudin in critically ill patients on continuous hemodialysis can be performed without excessive bleeding risk by combining close clinical and laboratory monitoring. The hirudin dose has to be reduced because of renal failure, and may require adjustment for residual or recovering renal function and extracorporal elimination.",

    "abstract": "We have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the complex of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase and the anticancer drug trimetrexate. Two thousand seventy distance, 345 dihedral angle, and 144 hydrogen bond restraints were obtained from analysis of multidimensional NMR spectra recorded for complexes containing 15N-labeled protein. Simulated annealing calculations produced a family of 22 structures fully consistent with the constraints. Several intermolecular protein-ligand NOEs were obtained by using a novel approach monitoring temperature effects of NOE signals resulting from dynamic processes in the bound ligand. At low temperature (5 degrees C) the trimethoxy ring of bound trimetrexate is flipping sufficiently slowly to give narrow signals in slow exchange, which give good NOE cross peaks. At higher temperature these broaden and their NOE cross peaks disappear thus allowing the signals in the lower-temperature spectrum to be identified as NOEs involving ligand protons. The binding site for trimetrexate is well defined and this was compared with the binding sites in related complexes formed with methotrexate and trimethoprim. No major conformational differences were detected between the different complexes. The 2,4-diaminopyrimidine-containing moieties in the three drugs bind essentially in the same binding pocket and the remaining parts of their molecules adapt their conformations such that they can make effective van der Waals interactions with essentially the same set of hydrophobic amino acids, the side-chain orientations and local conformations of which are not greatly changed in the different complexes (similar chi1 and chi2 values).",

These compounds bearing two chiral centers, at position-1 in the ring and position-1' in the side chain attached at position 3, were tested for their ability to inhibit A and B forms of influenza neuraminidase. The 1-ethylpropylamide, diethylamide, dipropylamide, and 4-morpholinylamide showed very good inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 0.015-0.080 microM) vs the neuraminidase A form, but modest activity (IC(50) = 3.0-9.2 microM) vs the neuraminidase B form. Since the parent amides bear two chiral centers (C-1 and C-1'), three of the better inhibitors were tested at higher levels of diastereomeric purity. The diastereomers corresponding to the active forms of the 1-(ethyl)propylamide, the diethylamide, and the dipropylamide (all of the same configuration at the C-1' chiral center), and the diastereomer of the diethylamide representing the active form at both C-1' and C-1 were isolated or synthesized from precursors that were isolated as diastereomers. These diastereomers showed some improvement in neuraminidase inhibition over the parent diastereomeric mixtures. 1-Carboxy-1-hydroxy derivatives of the best active compounds, the diethylamide and the dipropylamide, were also prepared. These compounds were not as active as the compounds without the 1-hydroxy group.

    "abstract": "Prevention of cardiac mortality is the most important beneficial effect of iron chelation therapy. Unfortunately, compliance with the rigorous requirements of daily subcutaneous deferoxamine (DFO) infusions is still a serious limiting factor in treatment success. The development of orally effective iron chelators such as deferiprone and ICL670 is intended to improve compliance. Although total iron excretion with deferiprone is somewhat less than with DFO, deferiprone may have a better cardioprotective effect than DFO due to deferiprone's ability to penetrate cell membranes. Recent clinical studies indicate that oral ICL670 treatment is well tolerated and is as effective as parenteral DFO used at the standard dose of 40 mg/kg of body weight/day. Thus, for the patient with transfusional iron overload in whom results of DFO treatment are unsatisfactory, several orally effective agents are now available to avoid serious organ damage. Finally, combined chelation treatment is emerging as a reasonable alternative to chelator monotherapy. Combining a weak chelator that has a better ability to penetrate cells with a stronger chelator that penetrates cells poorly but has a more efficient urinary excretion may result in improved therapeutic effect through iron shuttling between the two compounds. The efficacy of combined chelation treatment is additive and offers an increased likelihood of success in patients previously failing DFO or deferiprone monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Anticholinergic drugs often cause a considerable degree of bronchodilation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pulmonary neuronal M(2) muscarinic receptors function to limit the magnitude of vagally induced bronchoconstriction. We hypothesized that the effectiveness of anticholinergic agents in patients with COPD may reflect increased vagal reactivity due to dysfunction of M(2) muscarinic receptors. The function of M(2) receptors and the magnitude of vagally induced bronchoconstriction were assessed in subjects with normal lung function and in subjects with COPD. A nasal cold dry air challenge was used to induce a bronchoconstriction, measured as a change in airway resistance (Raw) at 5 Hz (R5) using impulse oscillometry. In subjects with COPD R5 rose from 0.68 +/- 0.06 to 0.74 +/- 0.07 kPa/L/s after the cold dry air challenge (p &lt; 0.01) and in the control subjects R5 rose from 0.34 +/- 0.03 to 0.39 +/- 0.03 kPa/L/s (p &lt; 0.01). The bronchoconstriction was inhibited by pretreatment with ipratropium bromide, indicating that it was vagally mediated. In both groups of subjects pretreatment with the selective M(2) muscarinic receptor agonist pilocarpine (5 mg/ml) prevented the cold air-induced bronchoconstriction, indicating normal function of M(2) receptors. These studies indicate that M(2) muscarinic receptors are functional in subjects with stable COPD.",

    "abstract": "The major diabetes autoantigen, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), contains a region of sequence similarity, including six identical residues PEVKEK, to the P2C protein of coxsackie B virus, suggesting that cross-reactivity between coxsackie B virus and GAD65 can initiate autoimmune diabetes. We used the human islet cell mAbs MICA3 and MICA4 to identify the Ab epitopes of GAD65 by screening phage-displayed random peptide libraries. The identified peptide sequences could be mapped to a homology model of the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) binding domain of GAD65. For MICA3, a surface loop containing the sequence PEVKEK and two adjacent exposed helixes were identified in the PLP binding domain as well as a region of the C terminus of GAD65 that has previously been identified as critical for MICA3 binding. To confirm that the loop containing the PEVKEK sequence contributes to the MICA3 epitope, this loop was deleted by mutagenesis. This reduced binding of MICA3 by 70%. Peptide sequences selected using MICA4 were rich in basic or hydroxyl-containing amino acids, and the surface of the GAD65 PLP-binding domain surrounding Lys358, which is known to be critical for MICA4 binding, was likewise rich in these amino acids. Also, the two phage most reactive with MICA4 encoded the motif VALxG, and the reverse of this sequence, LAV, was located in this same region. Thus, we have defined the MICA3 and MICA4 epitopes on GAD65 using the combination of phage display, molecular modeling, and mutagenesis and have provided compelling evidence for the involvement of the PEVKEK loop in the MICA3 epitope.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; AX200; Filgrastim) is a stroke drug candidate with excellent preclinical evidence for efficacy. A previous phase IIa dose-escalation study suggested potential efficacy in humans. The present large phase IIb trial was powered to detect clinical efficacy in acute ischemic stroke patients. METHODS: G-CSF (135 microg/kg body weight intravenous over 72 hours) was tested against placebo in 328 patients in a multinational, multicenter, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial (NCT00927836; www.clinicaltrial.gov). Main inclusion criteria were &lt;=9-hour time window after stroke onset, infarct localization in the middle cerebral artery territory, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score range of 6 to 22, and baseline diffusion-weighted imaging lesion size &gt;=15 mL. Primary and secondary end points were the modified Rankin scale score and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at day 90, respectively. Data were analyzed using a prespecified model that adjusted for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at baseline, and initial infarct volume (diffusion-weighted imaging). RESULTS: G-CSF treatment failed to meet the primary and secondary end points of the trial. For additional end points such as mortality, Barthel index, or infarct size at day 30, G-CSF did not show efficacy either. There was, however, a trend for reduced infarct growth in the G-CSF group. G-CSF showed the expected peripheral pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, with a strong increase in leukocytes and monocytes. In parallel, the cytokine profile showed a significant decrease of interleukin-1. CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF, a novel and promising drug candidate with a comprehensive preclinical and clinical package, did not provide any significant benefit with respect to either clinical outcome or imaging biomarkers.

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The accurate quantification of brain radioactivity concentration is limited by the spatial resolution of the PET scanner for structures smaller than 2-3 times the resolution. In the presence of enlarged cerebrospinal fluid spaces or regions of cortical neuronal loss, a significant underestimation of gray-matter radioactivity concentration due to the resulting partial-volume averaging can potentially occur. To recover the true radioactivity concentration from PET data, algorithms that use the high-resolution anatomic information provided by MRI have been developed. Their effect on PET quantification has been assessed using regions of interest and non-operator-dependent voxel-based analyses such as statistical parametric mapping (SPM), although the mechanisms that lead to an improvement in PET quantification after partial-volume correction (PVC), compared with no PVC, have not been addressed. METHODS: We studied the influence of our previously described MRI-based PVC algorithm on SPM analysis of age effects on mu-opioid receptor (mu -OR) binding using (11)C-carfentanil PET in 14 healthy subjects (age range, 29-74 y). RESULTS: Mu-OR binding increased with age at a rate of about 0.9% per year in the left temporal cortex after PVC, consistent with the results obtained from human autoradiographic studies. Without PVC, no significant relationship with age was observed. PVC decreased mainly the residual variability of voxel mu-OR binding values around the age regression line. CONCLUSION: MRI-based PVC improves the sensitivity and accuracy of voxel-based statistical analysis of PET data.",

A post-hoc analysis of the phase III SECURE trial assessed effects on cardiac safety. L-type Ca2+ channels were most sensitive to inhibition by isavuconazole. The 50% inhibitory concentrations for ion channels were higher than maximum serum concentrations of nonprotein-bound isavuconazole in vivo. In the phase I study (n = 161), isavuconazole shortened the QT interval in a dose- and plasma concentration-related manner. There were no serious treatment-emergent adverse events; palpitations and tachycardia were observed in placebo and supratherapeutic isavuconazole groups; no cardiac safety signals were detected in the SECURE study (n = 257). Isavuconazole was associated with a shortened cardiac QT interval.",

A single cloned receptor, GABA(B)R1, which has at least three alternatively spliced forms, appears to account for the vast majority of binding sites in the brain for high-affinity antagonists. In heterologous expression systems GABA(B)R1 is poorly expressed on the plasma membrane and largely fails to couple to ion channels. A second gene, GABA(B)R2, which exhibits moderately low homology to GABA(B)R1, permits surface expression of GABA(B)R1 and the appearance of baclofen-sensitive K(+) and Ca(+1) currents. We review the data that supports a model of the native GABA(B) receptor as a heterodimer composed of GABA(B)R1 and GABA(B)R2 proteins. New data from mutagenesis experiments are presented that point to amino acid residues on GABA(B)R1 critical for ligand activation of the heterodimer. The possible role of GABA(B)R2 in signal transduction is also discussed. The interdependent nature of the two subunits for receptor function makes the GABA(B) receptor a useful model to explore the larger significance of GPCR dimerization for G-protein activation.",

    "abstract": "The development of potent steroid sulfatase inhibitors is an important new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. A series of tricyclic coumarin sulfamates were synthesized, and their inhibitory properties were examined in vitro and in vivo. In a placental microsomal assay system, 667 COUMATE emerged as the most potent inhibitor with an IC50 of 8 nM. Administration of a single dose (10 mg/kg, p.o.) of 667 COUMATE inhibited rat liver estrone sulfatase activity by 93%. 667 COUMATE was devoid of estrogenicity, as indicated by its failure to stimulate the growth of uteri in ovariectomized rats. In vivo, estrone sulfate-stimulated growth of uteri in ovariectomized rats was inhibited by 667 COUMATE. Using the nitrosomethylurea-induced mammary tumor model, we found that 667 COUMATE caused regression of estrone sulfate-stimulated tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. The identification of 667 COUMATE as a potent steroid sulfatase inhibitor will enable the therapeutic potential of this type of therapy to be evaluated.",

Biochemistry 2005, 44, 5258). Compounds 1-10, which represent five cognate sulfamate/sulfamide pairs, were studied by ThermoFluor to obtain binding affinities (K(a) values). The corresponding dissociation constants, K(d), provide an independent measure of CA-II activity relative to commonly used K(i) values from enzyme kinetics studies. There was a sizable difference in potency between the sulfamates and sulfamides, with the sulfamides being much less potent, by factors ranging from 25 (7/8) to 1,200 (3/4). These results are consistent with our recent report that sulfamides tend to be much weaker inhibitors of CA-II than their corresponding sulfamates (Maryanoff et al. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 1941). Additionally, for arylsulfamides 10-12 the K(d) values determined by ThermoFluor and the K(i) values determined from enzyme kinetics are consistent. It appears that the sulfamide group is less suitable than the sulfamate group for obtaining potent inhibition of CA-II.",

    "abstract": "The transient receptor potential melastatin-related channel 2 (TRPM2) is a nonselective cation channel, whose prolonged activation by oxidative and nitrative agents leads to cell death. Here, we show that the drug puromycin selectively targets TRPM2-expressing cells, leading to cell death. Our data suggest that the silent information regulator 2 (Sir2 or sirtuin) family of enzymes mediates this susceptibility to cell death. Sirtuins are protein deacetylases that regulate gene expression, apoptosis, metabolism, and aging. These NAD+-dependent enzymes catalyze a reaction in which the acetyl group from substrate is transferred to the ADP-ribose portion of NAD+ to form deacetylated product, nicotinamide, and the metabolite OAADPr, whose functions remain elusive. Using cell-based assays and RNA interference, we show that puromycin-induced cell death is greatly diminished by nicotinamide (a potent sirtuin inhibitor), and by decreased expression of sirtuins SIRT2 and SIRT3. Furthermore, we demonstrate using channel current recordings and binding assays that OAADPr directly binds to the cytoplasmic domain of TRPM2 and activates the TRPM2 channel. ADP-ribose binds TRPM2 with similarly affinity, whereas NAD+ displays almost negligible binding. These studies provide the first evidence for the potential role of sirtuin-generated OAADPr in TRPM2 channel gating.",

ABT-510 is a synthetic analog of thrombospondin-1, well tolerated in phase I studies. We conducted a phase II trial evaluating the clinical efficacy of ABT-510 and its effects on biomarkers of angiogenesis and immunity in patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 2-stage phase II clinical trial was conducted to assess the clinical efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamic effects (angiogenesis and immunity) of ABT-510 in patients with stage IV melanoma. The primary endpoint was 18-week treatment failure rate. Patients self-administered 100 mg of ABT-510 subcutaneously twice daily. Blood samples were collected at baseline and every 3 weeks while on therapy. Eligible patients demonstrated measurable disease, good performance status and no evidence of intracranial metastases. Correlative laboratory studies evaluated biomarkers of angiogenesis and immunity. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled. Most patients were stage M1c (71%) and all had prior therapy for MM. Only 3 of the first 20 patients enrolled were progression free and on treatment at 18 weeks resulting in early termination of the study. Decreases in peripheral blood VEGF-A levels and VEGF-C levels, and CD146 and CD34/133 counts relative to pretreatment were detected. Limited changes in antitumor T cell immunity were observed. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-510 therapy administered at 100 mg twice/day in patients with MM did not demonstrate definite clinical efficacy. Further dose escalation or combination with cytotoxic therapy may be more effective therapeutically.",

    "title": "Selective estrogen receptor modulators: an update on recent clinical findings.",
    "abstract": "Recent clinical data on selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have provided the basis for reassessment of the SERM concept. The molecular basis of SERM activity involves binding of the ligand SERM to the estrogen receptor (ER), causing conformational changes which facilitate interactions with coactivator or corepressor proteins, and subsequently initiate or suppress transcription of target genes. SERM activity is intrinsic to each ER ligand, which accomplishes its unique profile by specific interactions in the target cell, leading to tissue selective actions. We discuss the estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects of early SERMs, such as clomiphene citrate, used for treatment of ovulation induction, and the triphenylethylene, tamoxifen, which has ER antagonist activity in the breast, and is used for prevention and treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. Since the development of tamoxifen, other triphenylethylene SERMs have been studied for breast cancer prevention, including droloxifene, idoxifene, toremifene, and ospemifene. Other SERMs have entered clinical development more recently, including benzothiophenes (raloxifene and arzoxifene), benzopyrans (ormeloxifene, levormeloxifene, and EM-800), lasofoxifene, pipendoxifene, bazedoxifene, HMR-3339, and fulvestrant, an anti-estrogen which is approved for breast cancer treatment. SERMs have effects on tissues containing ER, such as the breast, bone, uterine and genitourinary tissues, and brain, and on markers of cardiovascular risk. Current evidence indicates that each SERM has a unique array of clinical activities. Differences in the patterns of action of SERMs suggest that each clinical end point must be evaluated individually, and conclusions about any particular SERM can only be established through appropriate clinical trials.",

On the basis of studies of stability to beta-lactamase, outer membrane permeation, and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), we conclude that decreased affinity for PBP 3 may play an important role in the resistance to ceftezole, cefazolin, and cephalothin in B. fragilis G-232. Another group (also ca. 15%), of which B. fragilis G-242 was a representative, was resistant to all five cephalosporins (MIC, 100 to 400 micrograms/ml) and produced a high amount of beta-lactamase. Similar broad-spectrum resistance was seen in a mutant of strain G-232 that had a greater-than-30-fold increase in beta-lactamase production.",

    "abstract": "The 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17beta-HSDs) catalyze the interconversion between the oxidized and reduced forms of androgens and estrogens at the 17 position. The 17beta-HSD type 1 enzyme (17beta-HSD1) catalyzes the reduction of estrone to estradiol and is expressed in malignant breast cells. Inhibitors of this enzyme thus have potential as treatments for hormone dependent breast cancer. Here we report the syntheses and biological evaluation of novel inhibitors based on the estrone or estradiol template. These have been investigated by modification at the 6, 16 or 17 positions or combinations of these in order to gain information about structure-activity relationships by probing different areas in the enzyme active site. Activity data have been incorporated into a QSAR with predictive power, and the X-ray crystal structures of compounds 15 and 16c have been determined. Compound 15 has an IC50 of 320 nM for 17beta-HSD1 and is selective for 17beta-HSD1 over 17beta-HSD2. Three libraries of amides are also reported that led to the identification of inhibitors 19e and 20a, which have IC50 values of 510 and 380 nM respectively, and 20 h which, having an IC50 value of 37 nM, is the most potent inhibitor of 17beta-HSD1 reported to date. These amides are also selective for 17beta-HSD1 over 17beta-HSD2.",

    "abstract": "CP-88,818 (beta-tigogenin cellobioside; tiqueside) is a synthetic saponin developed to treat hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting the absorption of biliary and dietary cholesterol. Two studies are reported here: one in patients to assess safety and efficacy, and one in normal volunteers to explore the mechanism of action. The former included 15 hypercholesterolemic outpatients [low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) &gt; or = 160 mg/dl] treated with 1, 2, and 3 g of tiqueside daily (b.i.d.) in a crossover design for three 2-week treatment periods, each separated by a 3-week placebo period. The mechanistic study was conducted with 24 healthy male subjects who were randomized in a parallel group design to either placebo (n = 6) or tiqueside (2 or 4 g/day; n = 9 each) once daily for 3 weeks. All subjects in this study were fed a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet [National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step 1]. Fecal steroid excretion rates and plasma lipid levels were determined at baseline and after 3 weeks of treatment. Fractional cholesterol absorption was measured before and after treatment by the continuous feeding, dual-isotope method. Tiqueside produced a dose-dependent reduction in plasma LDL cholesterol levels in the hypercholesterolemic patients. In the mechanistic study, it decreased fractional cholesterol absorption rates and increased fecal neutral sterol excretion rates, changes associated with trends toward lower LDL cholesterol levels. Other lipoprotein levels were unaffected, as were fecal fat and bile acid excretion and fat-soluble vitamin absorption. Thus tiqueside dose-dependently inhibits cholesterol absorption in humans, resulting in a reduction in serum LDL cholesterol levels.",

Structure-activity studies reveal beneficial modifications that result in improved antiviral potency in cell culture in a murine ocular model of HSV-induced keratitis. These modifications include a stereochemically defined (2,6-dimethylcyclohexyl)amino N-terminus, two ketomethylene amide bond isosteres, and a (1-ethylneopentyl)amino C-terminus.

Yet tuberculosis still remains a leading infectious disease worldwide, largely owing to persistence of tubercle bacillus and inadequacy of the current chemotherapy. The increasing emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis along with the HIV pandemic threatens disease control and highlights both the need to understand how our current drugs work and the need to develop new and more effective drugs. This review provides a brief historical account of tuberculosis drugs, examines the problem of current chemotherapy, discusses the targets of current tuberculosis drugs, focuses on some promising new drug candidates, and proposes a range of novel drug targets for intervention. Finally, this review addresses the problem of conventional drug screens based on inhibition of replicating bacilli and the challenge to develop drugs that target nonreplicating persistent bacilli. A new generation of drugs that target persistent bacilli is needed for more effective treatment of tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Preclinical brain receptor occupancy measures have heretofore been conducted by quantifying the brain distribution of a radiolabeled tracer ligand using either scintillation spectroscopy or tomographic imaging. For smaller animals like rodents, the majority of studies employ tissue dissection and scintillation spectroscopy. These measurements can also be accomplished using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectral detection to measure the brain distribution of tracer molecules, obviating the need for radioligands. In order to validate mass spectroscopy-based receptor occupancy methods, we examined dopamine D2 receptor dose-occupancy curves for a number of antipsychotic drugs in parallel experiments using either mass spectroscopy or radioligand-based approaches. Oral dose-occupancy curves were generated for 8 antipsychotic compounds in parallel experiments using either radiolabeled or unlabeled raclopride tracer. When curves generated by these two methods were compared and ED(50) values determined, remarkably similar data were obtained. Occupancy ED(50) values were (mg/kg): chlorpromazine, 5.1 and 2.7; clozapine, 41 and 40; haloperidol, 0.2 and 0.3; olanzapine, 2.1 and 2.2; risperidone, 0.1 and 0.4; spiperone, 0.5 and 0.4; thioridazine 9.2 and 9.5; and ziprasidone 1.4 and 2.1 (unlabeled and radiolabeled raclopride tracer, respectively).

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Diminished coronary flow reserve and myocardial dysfunction following coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion have been attributed to neutrophil infiltration into the reperfused regions. Release of free radicals and elastase during reperfusion may also contribute to ischaemia-reperfusion induced changes. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an elastase inhibitor on reperfusion induced attenuated coronary flow reserve and myocardial dysfunction. METHODS: Anaesthetised dogs were subjected to 1 h of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 2 h of reperfusion. Ten minutes before reperfusion, dogs were randomly given saline or the neutrophil elastase inhibitor ICI 200,880 (10 mg.kg-1) and treatment was continued for the next 70 min. While the regional myocardial shortening fraction and coronary blood flow responses to acetylcholine and glyceryl trinitrate were attenuated following coronary reperfusion in saline treated dogs, similar reductions were not observed in the ICI 200,880 treated dogs (p &lt; 0.01). Histopathology showed myocardial injury and extensive neutrophil infiltration in the reperfused regions in saline treated animals. In contrast, neutrophil infiltration was minimal in the ICI 200,880 treated dogs, in spite of myocardial injury. Myeloperoxidase, an index of neutrophil infiltration, was increased (p &lt; 0.02 v control regions) in the reperfused regions in saline treated dogs, but not in the ICI 200,880 treated dogs. Flow cytometry also showed diminished neutrophil infiltration and oxidative burst in reperfused myocardium of ICI 200,880 treated (v saline treated) dogs. CONCLUSIONS: The elastase inhibitor ICI 200,880 protects against ischaemia-reperfusion induced attenuated coronary flow reserve and myocardial dysfunction, and this protective effect is associated with decreased neutrophil infiltration into the reperfused regions.",

METHODS: Thirty-two Wistar rats with a deep second-degree cutaneous burn of 20% total body surface area were randomly divided into two groups: NP group (experimental group, 5 mg/kg NP) and normal saline as control group every other day. The expression copy quantity of albumin-mRNA and mean integrated absorbency(mIA) of AR in liver tissue were measured by quantitative fluorescent RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry respectively on the 4th, 7th, 14th and 21st days of post-burned. RESULTS: The expression levels of albumin-mRNA and AR in liver tissue in NP group were much higher than those in control group. The albumin-mRNA and AR expression increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) after 7 and 14 days, while the expression had no significant difference between NP group and control group on the 4th day.

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Tramadol is a widely used analgesic, but its mode of action is not well understood. To study the effects of tramadol on norepinephrine transporter (NET) function, we assayed the effect of tramadol on [3H]-norepinephrine ([3H]-NE) uptake and [3H]-desipramine binding to plasma membranes isolated from bovine adrenal medulla. We then characterized [14C]-tramadol binding in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Tramadol inhibited the desipramine-sensitive uptake of [3H]-NE by the cells in a concentration-dependent manner (50% inhibitory concentration = 21.5 +/- 6.0 microM). Saturation analysis revealed that tramadol increased the apparent Michaelis constant of [3H]-NE uptake without changing the maximal velocity, indicating that inhibition occurred via competition for the NET (inhibition constant, K(i) = 13.7 microM). Tramadol inhibited the specific binding of [3H]-desipramine to plasma membranes. Scatchard analysis of [3H]-desipramine binding revealed that tramadol increased the apparent dissociation constant (K(d)) for binding without altering maximal binding, indicating competitive inhibition (K(i) = 11.2 microM). The binding of [14C]-tramadol to the cells was specific and saturable, with a K(d) of 18.1 +/- 2.4 microM. These findings indicate that tramadol competitively inhibits NET function at desipramine-binding sites. IMPLICATIONS: Tramadol competitively inhibits norepinephrine transporter function at desipramine-binding sites in the adrenal medullary cells and probably the noradrenergic neurons of the descending inhibitory system.",

    "title": "Unusual pungency from extra-virgin olive oil is attributable to restricted spatial expression of the receptor of oleocanthal.",
    "abstract": "Oleocanthal, a major phenolic compound in extra-virgin olive oil with antiinflammatory properties, elicits an unusual oral pungency sensed almost exclusively in the throat. This contrasts with most other common oral irritants, such as cinnamaldehyde, capsaicin, and alcohol, which irritate mucus membranes throughout the oral cavity. Here, we show that this rare irritation pattern is a consequence of both the specificity of oleocanthal for a single sensory receptor and the anatomical restriction of this sensory receptor to the pharynx, within the oral cavity. We demonstrate, in vitro, that oleocanthal selectively activates the hTRPA1 channel in HEK 293 cells and that its ability to excite the trigeminal nervous system in rodents requires a functional TRPA1. Moreover, we similarly demonstrate that the over-the-counter analgesic, ibuprofen, which elicits the same restricted pharyngeal irritation as oleocanthal, also specifically excites rodent sensory neurons via TRPA1. Using human sensory psychophysical studies and immunohistochemical TRPA1 analyses of human oral and nasal tissues, we observe an overlap of the anatomical distribution of TRPA1 and the regions irritated by oleocanthal in humans. These results suggest that a TRPA1 (ANKTM1) gene product mediates the tissue sensitivity to oleocanthal within the oral cavity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, despite the fact that oleocanthal possesses the classic electrophilic reactivity of many TRPA1 agonists, it does not use the previously identified activation mechanism via covalent cysteine modification. These findings provide an anatomical and molecular explanation for a distinct oral sensation that is elicited by oleocanthal and ibuprofen and that is commonly experienced around the world when consuming many extra-virgin olive oils.",

    "abstract": "Growth hormone hypersecretion is a known cause of insulin resistance. This change in insulin sensitivity is believed to be mediated directly by growth hormone binding to its receptor. Five subjects ages 28-55 years who were participating in a clinical study that had been designed to assess the effects of a growth hormone receptor antagonist (Pegvisomant) on disease activity in acromegaly were evaluated to determine the role of growth hormone hypersecretion in inducing changes in insulin sensitivity. These subjects were treated with the 15-30 mg/day of Pegvisomant for periods ranging from 14 to 23 months. These doses were adequate to normalize IGF-I in four of the five subjects. The subjects were monitored to ensure that there were no significant changes in diet, exercise, or weight. Mean pretreatment IGF-I was 1104+/-277 ng/ml and decreased to a nadir of 355+/-157 ng/ml on treatment. After a 6-week withdrawal period, mean IGF-I had increased to 549+/-142 ng/ml. Fasting insulin was 35.2+/-16 uU/ml prior to treatment then decreased to a nadir of 19.9+/-14.6 uU/ml on treatment and then increased to 24.5+/-11.3 uU/ml. Fasting glucose decreased from 187+/-68 to 122+/-38 mg/dl and then increased to 159+/-41 mg/dl. Hemoglobin A(1)C decreased from 8.1+/-1.7 to 6.3+/-1.5%. Two subjects with overt type II diabetes had decreases in hemoglobin A(1)C from 8.3 to 5.9% and from 11.4 to 8.6%. These changes were associated with decreases in the amount of medication needed to control blood glucose. Weight remained stable throughout the study. The results show that the Pegvisomant is an effective agent for improving insulin resistance in subjects who have acromegaly and that this effect is independent of weight loss. The results suggest a potential role for Pevisomant in the treatment of insulin resistant states other than acromegaly.",

    "title": "Tricyclic antidepressants exhibit variable pharmacological profiles at the alpha(2A) adrenergic receptor.",
    "abstract": "Antidepressant mechanisms of action remain shrouded in mystery, greatly hindering our ability to develop therapeutics which can fully treat patients suffering from depressive disorders. In an attempt to shed new light on this topic, we have undertaken a series of studies investigating actions of tricyclic antidepressant drugs (TCAs) at the alpha2A adrenergic receptor (AR), a centrally important receptor, dysregulation of which has been linked to depression. Our previous work established a particular TCA, desipramine, as an arrestin-biased alpha2AAR ligand driving receptor endocytosis and downregulation but not canonical heterotrimeric G protein-mediated signaling. The present work is aimed at broadening our understanding of how members of the TCA drug class act at the alpha2AAR, as we have selected the closely related but subtly different TCAs imipramine and amitriptyline for evaluation. Our data demonstrate that these drugs do also function as direct arrestin-biased alpha2AAR ligands. However, these data reveal differences in receptor affinity and in the extent/nature of arrestin recruitment to and endocytosis of alpha2AARs. Specifically, amitriptyline exhibits an approximately 14-fold stronger interaction with the receptor, is a weaker driver of arrestin recruitment, and preferentially recruits a different arrestin subtype. Extent of endocytosis is similar for all TCAs studied so far, and occurs in an arrestin-dependent manner, although imipramine uniquely retains a slight ability to drive alpha2AAR endocytosis in arrestin-null cells. These findings signify an important expansion of our mechanistic understanding of antidepressant pharmacology, and provide useful insights for future medicinal chemistry efforts.",

    "abstract": "A number of conditions, including osteoporosis, frailty, and sexual dysfunction in both men and women have been improved using androgens. However, androgens are not widely used for these indications because of the side effects associated with these drugs. We describe an androgen receptor (AR) ligand that maintains expected anabolic activities with substantially diminished activity in the prostate. LGD2226 is a nonsteroidal, nonaromatizable, highly selective ligand for the AR, exhibiting virtually no affinity for the other intracellular receptors. We determined that AR bound to LGD2226 exhibits a unique pattern of protein-protein interactions compared with testosterone, fluoxymesterone (an orally available steroidal androgen), and other steroids, suggesting that LGD2226 alters the conformation of the ligand-binding domain. We demonstrated that LGD2226 is fully active in cell-based models of bone and muscle. LGD2226 exhibited anabolic activity on muscle and bone with reduced impact on prostate growth in rodent models. Biomechanical testing of bones from animals treated with LGD2226 showed strong enhancement of bone strength above sham levels. LGD2226 was also efficacious in a sex-behavior model in male rats measuring mounts, intromissions, ejaculations, and copulation efficiency. These results with an orally available, nonaromatizable androgen demonstrate the important role of the AR and androgens in mediating a number of beneficial effects in bone, muscle, and sexual function independent from the conversion of androgens into estrogenic ligands. Taken together, these results suggest that orally active, nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators may be useful therapeutics for enhancing muscle, bone, and sexual function.",

    "abstract": "Brugada syndrome has been linked to mutations in SCN5A. Agents that dissociate slowly from the sodium channel such as flecainide and ajmaline unmask the Brugada syndrome electrocardiogram and precipitate ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. Lidocaine, an agent with rapid dissociation kinetics, has previously been shown to exert no effect in patients with Brugada syndrome. We characterized a novel double mutation of SCN5A (V232I in DI-S4+L1308F in DIII-S4) identified in a rare case of lidocaine (1 mg/kg)-induced Brugada syndrome. We studied lidocaine blockade of I(Na) generated by wild-type and V232I+L1308F mutant cardiac sodium channels expressed in mammalian TSA201 cells using patch clamp techniques. Despite no significant difference in steady-state gating parameters between V232I+L1308F and wild-type sodium currents at baseline, use-dependent inhibition of I(Na) by lidocaine was more pronounced in V232I+L1308F versus wild-type (73.0+/-0.1% versus 18.23+/-0.04% at 10 micromol/L measured at 10 Hz, respectively). A dose of 10 micromol/L lidocaine also caused a more negative shift of steady-state inactivation in V232I+L1308F versus wild-type (-14.1+/-0.3 mV and -4.8+/-0.3 mV, respectively). The individual mutations produced a much less accentuated effect. We report the first case of lidocaine-induced Brugada electrocardiogram phenotype. The double mutation in SCN5A, V232I, and L1308F alters the affinity of the cardiac sodium channel for lidocaine such that the drug assumes Class IC characteristics with potent use-dependent block of the sodium channel. Our results demonstrate an additive effect of the 2 missense mutations to sensitize the sodium channel to lidocaine. These findings suggest caution when treating patients carrying such genetic variations with Class I antiarrhythmic drugs.",

Epidural ICP and MAP values were recorded at baseline, at completion of infusion, and every minute for the next 10 min. Blood study drug concentrations were measured immediately after completion of infusion. Neither opioid caused a significant increase in ICP. Both drugs were associated with a dose-dependent decrease in MAP. Remifentanil was 31 times more potent than alfentanil for effects on MAP.

    "abstract": "Galantamine (Reminyl; Janssen Pharmaceutica, Titusville, NJ) belongs to a class of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors approved for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The drug presumably acts by raising and prolonging the profile of acetylcholine (ACh) via an inhibitory effect on the esterase. However, there is also evidence demonstrating that galantamine can activate the nicotinic ACh receptor or modulate its activation by ACh. In this study, we have examined the ability of galantamine to directly activate the muscle-type nicotinic ACh receptor or to modulate receptor activation by selected nicotinic agonists. Studies of direct activation by galantamine demonstrated that this ligand is a low-efficacy agonist of the muscle-type ACh receptor. Point mutations in the M2-M3 linker (alphaS269I) and the M2 transmembrane domain (epsilonT264P) had similar effects on receptor activation by galantamine and nicotinic agonists, suggesting that the general features of receptor activation by galantamine are similar to that in the presence of ACh. Experiments performed in the simultaneous presence of galantamine and various nicotinic ligands showed that channel activation by the nicotinic ligands studied (ACh, carbachol, and choline) was not affected by the presence of galantamine at concentrations up to 100 microm. In addition, galantamine did not reduce the initial rate of binding for 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin. These results demonstrate that galantamine does not interfere with the occupation of the nicotinic agonist binding site by ACh, carbachol, or choline. We conclude that galantamine activates the muscle-type ACh receptor by interacting with a binding site that is distinct from the site for nicotinic agonists.",

Because Kcn1 did not express well (peak current in Xenopus laevis oocytes of 0.3 microA at +60 mV), the human homolog (KCNA10) was isolated, and its expression was optimized in oocytes. KCNA10 mediates voltage-gated K(+) currents that exhibit minimal steady-state inactivation. Ensemble currents of 5-10 microA at +40 mV were consistently recorded from injected oocytes. Channels are closed at the holding potential of -80 mV but are progressively activated by depolarizations more positive than -30 mV, with half-activation at +3.5 +/- 2.5 mV. The channel displays an unusual inhibitor profile because, in addition to being blocked by classical K channel blockers (barium tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine), it is also sensitive to inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channels (verapamil and pimozide). Tail-current analysis shows a reversal potential shift of 47 mV/decade change in K concentration, indicating a K-to-Na selectivity ratio of at least 15:1.

We conclude KCNA10 is a novel human voltage-gated K channel with features common to both K-selective and CNG cation channels. Given its distribution in renal blood vessels and heart, we speculate that KCNA10 may be involved in regulating the tone of renal vascular smooth muscle and may also participate in the cardiac action potential.",

    "abstract": "A covering letter and a questionnaire covering the diagnosis and treatment of thyrotoxicosis in childhood was circulated between October 1992 and February 1993 amongst 672 European members of the European Thyroid Association (ETA) and members of the European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology (ESPE). Almost 50% replied to the letter and 99 individuals or groups from 22 countries completed the questionnaire. A consensus was reached on the use of total thyroxine (T4) and/or free T4 and thyrotropin as routine diagnostic tools. Two-thirds included total triiodothyronine (T3) and/or free T3 and 32% used a thyrotropin-releasing hormone test. Surprisingly, thyroglobulin autoantibodies were used as a routine test by 78%; 63% included thyrotropin receptor antibodies and 60% microsomal antibodies, whereas only 50% measured thyroperoxidase antibodies. For thyroid imaging, 40% performed a thyroid scintigram and 56% measured the size of the thyroid gland by ultrasound. Antithyroid drugs (ATD) were the basic initial treatment of choice given by 99% of the respondents for children with uncomplicated Graves' disease. Carbimazole, methimazole and thiamazole were the most frequently used drugs, with a median initial dose of 0.8 mg.kg-1.day-1. Two-thirds added beta-blockers and a few used sedatives. The ATD dose was adjusted for each patient by 39%, whereas 56% combined ATD with T4 for long-term treatment; 84% gave treatment for a fixed period (44% for 1-2 years). Surgery was considered the treatment of choice in children with an adenoma (83%), with a nodular (53%) or large goiter (16%) and recurrence after ATD (14%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "title": "Characterization of rat brain aldosterone receptors reveals high affinity for corticosterone.",
    "abstract": "The two [3H]aldosterone-binding proteins of rat brain cytosol were characterized by a dextran-coated charcoal method. With molybdate present to stabilize receptors, the affinities of the two sites for [3H]aldosterone in adrenalectomized perfused rat brain cytosols were 0.28 and 18.0 nM at 4 C. High affinity sites comprised 15% of the total receptor number. A small contamination of perfused brain cytosol preparations with corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) was found. However, due to the very high affinity of CBG for corticosterone at 4 C, this slight contamination resulted in significant alterations in the apparent affinity of steroids competing for aldosterone-binding sites. Selective precipitation of cytosol receptors with 36% (NH4)2SO4 reduced CBG concentrations to negligible levels. After blockade of low affinity sites with a highly selective glucocorticoid (RU 26988), the order of steroids in competing for the high affinity receptor was desoxycorticosterone greater than fludrocortisone greater than corticosterone greater than aldosterone greater than progesterone greater than dexamethasone. Readdition of a small quantity of dialyzed serum to cytosol preparations yielded a profile of steroid binding similar to that of the kidney mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone greater than desoxycorticosterone greater than corticosterone). The distribution of both receptors in brain regions of adrenalectomized rats was determined. Both receptors were at greatest density in the hippocampus and lowest density in the hypothalamus. The high affinity site was at greatest density in limbic regions, whereas the low affinity receptor, apparently identical to the glucocorticoid type II receptor, was at greatest density in cortex and cerebellum. It is concluded that the high affinity aldosterone receptor of rat brain, which had been identified in preliminary studies as a mineralocorticoid receptor, may bind either corticosterone or aldosterone in vivo.",

    "title": "A novel method for screening the glutathione transferase inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glutathione transferases (GSTs) belong to the family of Phase II detoxification enzymes. GSTs catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to different endogenous and exogenous electrophilic compounds. Over-expression of GSTs was demonstrated in a number of different human cancer cells. It has been found that the resistance to many anticancer chemotherapeutics is directly correlated with the over-expression of GSTs. Therefore, it appears to be important to find new GST inhibitors to prevent the resistance of cells to anticancer drugs. In order to search for glutathione transferase (GST) inhibitors, a novel method was designed. RESULTS: Our results showed that two fragments of GST, named F1 peptide (GYWKIKGLV) and F2 peptide (KWRNKKFELGLEFPNL), can significantly inhibit the GST activity. When these two fragments were compared with several known potent GST inhibitors, the order of inhibition efficiency (measured in reactions with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (CDNB) and glutathione as substrates) was determined as follows: tannic acid &gt; cibacron blue &gt; F2 peptide &gt; hematin &gt; F1 peptide &gt; ethacrynic acid. Moreover, the F1 peptide appeared to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of the GST-catalyzed reaction, while the F2 peptide was determined as a competitive inhibitor of this reaction. CONCLUSION: It appears that the F2 peptide can be used as a new potent specific GST inhibitor. It is proposed that the novel method, described in this report, might be useful for screening the inhibitors of not only GST but also other enzymes.",

Development of HAT inhibitors with high selectivity and potency will provide powerful mechanistic tools for the elucidation of the biological functions of HATs and may also have pharmacological value for potential new therapies. In this work, analogs of the known HAT inhibitor anacardic acid were synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of HAT activity. Biochemical assays revealed novel anacardic acid analogs that inhibited the human recombinant enzyme Tip60 selectively compared to PCAF and p300. Enzyme kinetics studies demonstrated that inhibition of Tip60 by one such novel anacardic acid derive, 20, was essentially competitive with Ac-CoA and non-competitive with the histone substrate. In addition, these HAT inhibitors effectively inhibited acetyltransferase activity of nuclear extracts on the histone H3 and H4 at micromolar concentrations.",

In this study we assessed acute-phase reactants (APR) and immune response status (humoral and cellular) in active and inactive untreated AS patients categorized according to different activation/remission criteria. METHODS: Patients with AS were categorized into three groups as active and inactive according to ASsessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) International Working Group remission/partial remission criteria, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) less than 4 or equal or more than 4 and peripheral joint involvement present or absent. Health Assessment Questionnaire-Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S), Daugados Articular Index and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index were performed. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), immunoglobulin A, G and M, and complements C3 and C4, interferon-gamma, interleukin-4 and alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), alpha-2-macroglobulin, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, and transferrin were measured. Immunophenotypic analysis by flow cytometry was performed (CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio, CD19, CD16, CD56, CD23, CD25 and CD30 were assayed). RESULTS: Patients with peripheral involvement had higher ESR and CRP levels. According to ASAS criteria patients in remission had significantly lower values of disease activity and functional limitation measures, and AAT was the only APR significantly lower in remission/partial remission group. Lymphocyte subpopulations did not show significant correlation with clinical parameters or APR. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed weak a relation between APR and disease activity in AS; however, APR should not be disregarded in the evaluation of disease and/or response to the treatment, which was supported by the new research on biologic agents infliximab and etanercept in AS. The ASAS remission/partial remission criteria may discriminate patients' clinical activity status and AAT may be a good indicator of disease activity in AS.",

    "abstract": "Tetrahydrouridine (THU) is a well characterized and potent inhibitor of cytidine deaminase (CDA). Highly expressed CDA catalyzes and inactivates cytidine analogues, ultimately contributing to increased gemcitabine resistance. Therefore, a combination therapy of THU and gemcitabine is considered to be a potential and promising treatment for tumors with highly expressed CDA. In this study, we found that THU has an alternative mechanism for inhibiting cell growth which is independent of CDA expression. Three different carcinoma cell lines (MIAPaCa-2, H441, and H1299) exhibited decreased cell proliferation after sole administration of THU, while being unaffected by knocking down CDA. To investigate the mechanism of THU-induced cell growth inhibition, cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry was performed. This analysis revealed that THU caused an increased rate of G1-phase occurrence while S-phase occurrence was diminished. Similarly, Ki-67 staining further supported that THU reduces cell proliferation. We also found that THU regulates cell cycle progression at the G1/S checkpoint by suppressing E2F1. As a result, a combination regimen of THU and gemcitabine might be a more effective therapy than previously believed for pancreatic carcinoma since THU works as a CDA inhibitor, as well as an inhibitor of cell growth in some types of pancreatic carcinoma cells.",

    "abstract": "The family of Kv7 (KCNQ) potassium channels consists of five members. Kv7.2 and 3 are the primary molecular correlates of the M-current, but also Kv7.4 and Kv7.5 display M-current characteristics. M-channel modulators include blockers (e.g., linopirdine) for cognition enhancement and openers (e.g., retigabine) for treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. We investigated the effect of a Bristol-Myers Squibb compound (S)-N-[1-(3-morpholin-4-yl-phenyl)-ethyl]-3-phenyl-acrylamide [(S)-1] on cloned human Kv7.1-5 potassium channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Using two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings we found that (S)-1 blocks Kv7.1 and Kv7.1/KCNE1 currents. In contrast, (S)-1 produced a hyperpolarizing shift of the activation curve for Kv7.2, Kv7.2/Kv7.3, Kv7.4 and Kv7.5. Further, the compound enhanced the maximal current amplitude at all potentials for Kv7.4 and Kv7.5 whereas the combined activation/block of Kv7.2 and Kv7.2/3 was strongly voltage-dependent. The tryptophan residue 242 in S5, known to be crucial for the effect of retigabine, was also shown to be critical for the enhancing effect of (S)-1 and BMS204352. Furthermore, no additive effect on Kv7.4 current amplitude was observed when both retigabine and (S)-1 or BMS204352 were applied simultaneously. In conclusion, (S)-1 differentially affects the Kv7 channel subtypes and is dependent on a single tryptophan for the current enhancing effect in Kv7.4.",

    "title": "Centrally acting antihypertensives: a renaissance of interest. Mechanisms and haemodynamics.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Classic centrally acting antihypertensives are known to stimulate alpha2-adrenoceptors located in the pontomedullary region, in the vicinity of the nucleus tractus solitarii, vasomotor centre, vagal nucleus and the various interconnecting neurones. The stimulation of these central alpha2-adrenoceptors induces peripheral sympathoinhibition and hence a reduction in (elevated) blood pressure, predominantly as a result of vasodilation and a consequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. ANTIHYPERTENSIVES: Clonidine, guanfacine, guanabenz and alpha-methyldopa (via its active metabolite alpha-methylnoradrenaline) are well-known examples of classic centrally acting antihypertensives. They are effective antihypertensives with an attractive haemodynamic profile. However, these agents have lost much of their clinical interest because of their subjectively unpleasant side-effects (sedation, dry mouth, impotence). Since these side-effects are also mediated, to a major extent, by alpha2-adrenoceptors it is virtually impossible to separate the desired centrally induced antihypertensive effect and the adverse reactions by designing new compounds. DRUG TARGETS: I1-Imidazoline receptors have recently been discovered as a new target of centrally acting antihypertensives. When stimulated with agonists the I1-imidazoline receptors, located in the nucleus reticularis lateralis will trigger peripheral sympathoinhibition, following similar pathways as involved in the effects of the classic alpha2-adrenoceptor stimulants. Moxonidine and rilmenidine are I1-imidazoline receptor stimulants with little affinity for alpha2-adrenoceptors. Accordingly, such agents lower elevated blood pressure in a similar manner as the aforementioned older drugs, but it may be hoped that their side-effect profile is more favourable. CONCLUSION: Accordingly, it would now be possible to separate the attractive haemodynamic properties and the side-effects of centrally acting antihypertensives.",

Several of the analogues are potent antagonists of the homomeric alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), displaying nanomolar binding affinities and inhibiting acetylcholine-evoked signaling through the receptor in a competitive manner. In contrast, they do not display activities at heteromeric neuronal nAChRs and only exhibit weak antagonistic activities at the related 5-HT3A serotonin receptor. In a mutagenesis study, five selected analogues have been demonstrated to bind to the orthosteric site of the alpha7 nAChR. The binding site of the compounds overlaps with that of the standard alpha7 antagonist methyllycaconitine, the binding of them being centered in a cation-pi interaction between the quaternary nitrogen atom of the ligand and the Trp149 residue in the receptor, with additional key contributions from other aromatic receptor residues such as Tyr188, Tyr195, and Trp55.",

    "abstract": "Frequencies of mutation to resistance with trovafloxacin and four other quinolones were determined with quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus RN4220 by a direct plating method. First-step mutants were selected less frequently with trovafloxacin (1.1 x 10(-10) at 2 to 4x the MIC) than with levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin (3.0 x 10(-7) to 3.0 x 10(-8) at 2 to 4x the MIC). Mutants with a change in GrlA (Ser80--&gt;Phe or Tyr) were most commonly selected with trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or pefloxacin. First-step mutants were difficult to select with sparfloxacin; however, second-step mutants with mutations in gyrA were easily selected when a preexisting mutation in grlA was present. Against 29 S. aureus clinical isolates with known mutations in gyrA and/or grlA, trovafloxacin was the most active quinolone tested (MIC at which 50% of isolates are inhibited [MIC(50)] and MIC(90), 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively); in comparison, MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were 32 and 128, 16 and 32, 8 and 32, and 128 and 256 microg/ml for ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, and pefloxacin, respectively. Strains with a mutation in grlA only were generally susceptible to all of the quinolones tested. For mutants with changes in both grlA and gyrA MICs were higher and were generally above the susceptibility breakpoint for ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, and pefloxacin. Addition of reserpine (20 microg/ml) lowered the MICs only of ciprofloxacin fourfold or more for 18 of 29 clinical strains. Topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase genes were cloned from S. aureus RN4220 and from two mutants with changes in GrlA (Ser80--&gt;Phe and Glu84--&gt;Lys). The enzymes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli GI724, purified, and used in DNA catalytic and cleavage assays that measured the relative potency of each quinolone. Trovafloxacin was at least five times more potent than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, or pefloxacin in stimulating topoisomerase IV-mediated DNA cleavage. While all of the quinolones were less potent in cleavage assays with the altered topoisomerase IV, trovafloxacin retained its greater potency relative to those of the other quinolones tested. The greater intrinsic potency of trovafloxacin against the lethal topoisomerase IV target in S. aureus contributes to its improved potency against clinical strains of S. aureus that are resistant to other quinolones.",

Experiments were performed to determine the role of alpha(2)-AR subtypes (alpha(2A)-, alpha(2B)-, alpha(2C)-ARs) in this response. Stimulation of alpha(1)-ARs by phenylephrine or alpha(2)-ARs by UK-14,304 caused constriction of isolated mouse tail arteries mounted in a pressurized myograph system. Compared with proximal arteries, distal arteries were more responsive to alpha(2)-AR activation but less responsive to activation of alpha(1)-ARs. Cold augmented constriction to alpha(2)-AR activation in distal arteries but did not affect the response to alpha(1)-AR stimulation or the level of myogenic tone. Western blot analysis demonstrated expression of alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-ARs in tail arteries: expression of alpha(2C)-ARs decreased in distal compared with proximal arteries, whereas expression of the glycosylated form of the alpha(2A)-AR increased in distal arteries. At 37 degrees C, alpha(2)-AR-induced vasoconstriction in distal arteries was inhibited by selective blockade of alpha(2A)-ARs (BRL-44408) but not by selective inhibition of alpha(2B)-ARs (ARC-239) or alpha(2C)-ARs (MK-912). In contrast, during cold exposure (28 degrees C), the augmented response to UK-14,304 was inhibited by the alpha(2C)-AR antagonist MK-912, which selectively abolished cold-induced amplification of the response. These experiments indicate that cold-induced amplification of alpha(2)-ARs is mediated by alpha(2C)-ARs that are normally silent in these cutaneous arteries.

    "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a cellular energy sensor: it responds to an increase in AMP concentration ([AMP]) or the AMP-to-ATP ratio (AMP/ATP). Metformin and phenformin, which are biguanides, have been reported to increase AMPK activity without increasing AMP/ATP. This study tests the hypothesis that these biguanides increase AMPK activity in the heart by increasing cytosolic [AMP]. Groups of isolated rat hearts (n = 5-7 each) were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer with or without 0.2 mM phenformin or 10 mM metformin, and (31)P-NMR-measured phosphocreatine, ATP, and intracellular pH were used to calculate cytosolic [AMP]. At various times, hearts were freeze-clamped and assayed for AMPK activity, phosphorylation of Thr(172) on AMPK-alpha, and phosphorylation of Ser(79) on acetyl-CoA carboxylase, an AMPK target. In hearts treated with phenformin for 18 min and then perfused for 20 min with Krebs-Henseleit buffer, [AMP] began to increase at 26 min and AMPK activity was elevated at 36 min. In hearts treated with metformin, [AMP] was increased at 50 min and AMPK activity, phosphorylated AMPK, and phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase were elevated at 61 min. In metformin-treated hearts, HPLC-measured total AMP content and total AMP/ATP did not increase. In summary, phenformin and metformin increase AMPK activity and phosphorylation in the isolated heart. The increase in AMPK activity was always preceded by and correlated with increased cytosolic [AMP]. Total AMP content and total AMP/ATP did not change. Cytosolic [AMP] reported metabolically active AMP, which triggered increased AMPK activity, but measures of total AMP did not.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) exhibit genetic polymorphism and tissue specificity. ADH and ALDH isozyme phenotypes from 39 surgical Chinese lung specimens were identified by agarose isoelectric focusing. The identity of the lung beta-ADHs was further demonstrated by their characteristic pH-activity profiles for ethanol oxidation, Km values for NAD and ethanol, and inhibition by 4-methylpyrazole or 1,10-phenanthroline. The beta 2 allele, coding for beta 2 polypeptide, was found to be predominant in the lung specimens studied. The ADH activities in the lungs with the homozygous phenotype ADH2 2-2 (exhibiting beta 2 beta 2) and ADH2 1-1 (exhibiting beta 1 beta 1) and the heterozygous phenotype ADH2 2-1 (exhibiting beta 2 beta 2, beta 2 beta 1, and beta 1 beta 1) were determined to be 999 +/- 77, 48 +/- 17, and 494 +/- 61 nmol/min/g tissue, respectively. Fifty-one percent of the specimens studied lacked the ALDH2 activity band on the isoelectric focusing gels. The activities in the lung tissues with the ALDH2-active phenotype and the inactive phenotype were determined to be 30 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 1 nmol/min/g tissue, respectively. These findings indicate that human pulmonary ethanol-metabolizing activities differ significantly with respect to genetic polymorphism at both the ADH2 and the ALDH2 loci. The results suggest that individuals with high Vmax beta 2-ADH and deficient in low-Km mitochondrial ALDH2, accounting for approximately 45% of the Chinese population, may end up with acetaldehyde accumulation during alcohol consumption, rendering them vulnerable to tissue injury caused by this highly reactive and toxic metabolite.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Interferon alpha (IFNalpha) is a known antiviral agent. A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted investigating the use of low-dose oral interferon alpha for preventing acute viral respiratory illnesses. METHODS: Two hundred healthy adults aged 18-75 years were enrolled and completed weekly health data questionnaires to monitor for symptoms and impact of respiratory illness. Serum samples were tested for antibodies against influenza and other common respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Low-dose oral IFNalpha prophylaxis did not reduce the incidence or impact of acute respiratory illness (ARI) or the impact of illness on daily activities. Post hoc analysis of participant subgroups, however, identified significant reductions in the incidence of ARI reported by males, those aged 50 years or more and those who received the 2009 seasonal influenza vaccine. Interferon alpha prophylaxis had a significant impact on the reporting of moderate-to-severe feverishness by the study population. Seropositive participants in the IFN group were more likely to report asymptomatic or mild symptoms compared with those in the placebo group who were more likely to report stronger symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose oral IFNalpha prophylaxis was not effective in limiting the overall incidence of ARI in our study population. However, there was evidence that prophylaxis reduced the severity of symptoms and had a beneficial effect in some subpopulations, including those who received the 2009 seasonal trivalent influenza vaccination.",

    "abstract": "An extensive amount of research has focused on the development of new pharmacological agents to treat schizophrenia. Varying from person to person, schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease with symptoms of positive, negative, and cognitive deficits. PRX-07034, a 5-hydroxytryptamine6 (5-HT6) receptor antagonist has been evaluated for its potential in treating obesity and cognitive deficits. This study evaluated PRX-07034 (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg body mass, by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection), in combination with a low dose of prazosin (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.), for its antipsychotic potential. The research utilized a stereotypy assay, an open field test, an object recognition task, and prepulse inhibition. Dizocilpine, a non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, was also administered in the above-mentioned assays as a psychomimetic. The combination of PRX-07034 and prazosin alleviated stereotypy and hyperlocomotor activity while enhancing memory in an object recognition task, and reversed sensory-gating deficits induced by dizocilpine. Examination of the medial prefrontal cortex revealed that a combination of PRX-07034 and prazosin reduced the dizocilpine-mediated increase of 5-HT. These results suggest that the combination of a 5-HT6 antagonist with low doses of prazosin could have therapeutic potential in the treatment of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma (NR1C3)) plays a central role in adipogenesis and is the molecular target for the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of antidiabetic drugs. In a search for novel non-TZD ligands for PPARgamma, T0070907 was identified as a potent and selective PPARgamma antagonist. With an apparent binding affinity (concentration at 50% inhibition of [(3)H]rosiglitazone binding or IC(50)) of 1 nm, T0070907 covalently modifies PPARgamma on cysteine 313 in helix 3 of human PPARgamma2. T0070907 blocked PPARgamma function in both cell-based reporter gene and adipocyte differentiation assays. Consistent with its role as an antagonist of PPARgamma, T0070907 blocked agonist-induced recruitment of coactivator-derived peptides to PPARgamma in a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence-based assay and promoted recruitment of the transcriptional corepressor NCoR to PPARgamma in both glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and a PPARgamma/retinoid X receptor (RXR) alpha-dependent gel shift assay. Studies with mutant receptors suggest that T0070907 modulates the interaction of PPARgamma with these cofactor proteins by affecting the conformation of helix 12 of the PPARgamma ligand-binding domain. Interestingly, whereas the T0070907-induced NCoR recruitment to PPARgamma/RXRalpha heterodimer can be almost completely reversed by the simultaneous treatment with RXRalpha agonist LGD1069, T0070907 treatment has only modest effects on LGD1069-induced coactivator recruitment to the PPARgamma/RXRalpha heterodimer. These results suggest that the activity of PPARgamma antagonists can be modulated by the availability and concentration of RXR agonists. T0070907 is a novel tool for the study of PPARgamma/RXRalpha heterodimer function.",

However, a proportion of patients are not responsive to this treatment. Inefficacy may represent a TNFalpha independent disease or insufficient drug at the site of action. CASE REPORT: A patient with RA resistant to repeated high dose infliximab infusions and intra-articular infliximab into an inflamed knee is described. No beneficial clinical effect was observed. Pre-injection arthroscopic biopsy of the study knee demonstrated TNFalpha staining but also confirmed the presence of lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha or TNFbeta) on immunohistochemistry. Subsequent treatment with etanercept (which blocks LTalpha as well as TNFalpha) resulted in clinical remission of disease. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that resistance to TNF blockade may occur when TNFalpha is not the dominant inflammatory cytokine and suggests that LTalpha may have a pathogenic role in RA.",

    "abstract": "Selegiline (deprenyl) is a selective inhibitor of cerebral monoamine oxidase type B at the dosage (10 mg/day) used in patients with Parkinson's disease. Through this activity, the drug increases nigrostriatal dopamine levels, and may protect neurons against damage by free radicals and possibly exogenous neurotoxins. Selegiline also inhibits dopamine reuptake from the synaptic cleft. Because of its selectivity, selegiline 10mg daily does not prevent the breakdown and exacerbate the indirect pressor effects of dietary amines such as tyramine; it is devoid of the 'cheese' effect. Following oral administration, selegiline is rapidly metabolised to L-methamphetamine and L-amphetamine, which may account for the euphoria and insomnia seen in many patients, although potentiation of dopaminergic activity with concurrent levodopa appears more likely. The drug is a useful adjunct to levodopa in Parkinsonism, improving 'end-of-dose' fluctuations, producing modest improvements in motor function, and allowing a reduction in levodopa dosage. Indeed, if levodopa dosages are not decreased when selegiline is added to the therapeutic regimen, peak concentration dyskinesias due to levodopa are often exacerbated. However, symptomatic benefits are rarely maintained for more than a year and selegiline is relatively ineffective in allaying the abrupt swings in response to levodopa ('on/off' effects). When used alone in patients with mild disease, selegiline appears to slow the rate of symptom progression and may extend survival, through either neuroprotection or symptom relief. Whichever mechanism(s) is responsible, there is strong evidence to suggest that selegiline should be considered both in patients newly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in an attempt to delay symptom progression, and in those experiencing dose-dependent fluctuations in response to levodopa.",

However, its antidepressant activitiy was found in the 'despair test' in rats. On the other hand, pizotifen inhibited the head twitch reaction induced by L-5-hydroxytryptophan in mice (ED50 = 0.009 mg/kg, i.p.) and by 5-methoxytryptamine (+ tranylcypromine) in rats (ED50 = 0.45 mg/kg, i.p.). It also antagonized tryptamine-induced clonic convulsions of fore-paws in rats (ED50 = 0.35 mg/kg, i.p.), and in doses of 5--10 mg/kg s.c. inhibited hyperthermia produced by LSD in rabbits. Finally, pizotifen (0.1--0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) inhibited or abolished LSD- or quipazine-induced stimulation of the hind limb flexor reflex of spinal rats; the above effect was not due to noradrenolytic action of the drug. These results suggest that pizotifen strongly blocks the central postsynaptic serotonin receptors.",

This is particularly crucial in ligand binding events, when induced fit can lead to protein structure rearrangements. As a consequence of the huge conformational space available to protein structures, receptor flexibility is rarely considered in ligand design procedures. In this work, we present an algorithm for integrating protein binding-site flexibility into de novo ligand design and docking processes. The approach allows dynamic rearrangement of amino acid side chains during the docking and design simulations. The impact of protein conformational flexibility is investigated in the docking of highly active inhibitors in the binding sites of acetylcholinesterase and human collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-1) and in the design of ligands in the S1' pocket of MMP-1. The results of corresponding simulations for both rigid and flexible binding sites are compared in order to gauge the influence of receptor flexibility in drug discovery protocols.",

    "abstract": "Treatment with the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) agonist bromocriptine improves metabolic features in obese patients with type 2 diabetes by a still unknown mechanism. In the present study, we investigated the acute effect of bromocriptine and its underlying mechanism(s) on insulin secretion both in vivo and in vitro. For this purpose, C57Bl6/J mice were subjected to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) and a hyperglycemic (HG) clamp 60min after a single injection of bromocriptine or placebo. The effects of bromocriptine on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), cell membrane potential and intracellular cAMP levels were also determined in INS-1E beta cells. We report here that bromocriptine increased glucose levels during ipGTT in vivo, an effect associated with a dose-dependent decrease in GSIS. During the HG clamp, bromocriptine reduced both first-phase and second-phase insulin response. This inhibitory effect was also observed in INS-1E beta cells, in which therapeutic concentrations of bromocriptine (0.5-50nM) decreased GSIS. Mechanistically, neither cellular energy state nor cell membrane depolarization was affected by bromocriptine whereas intracellular cAMP levels were significantly reduced, suggesting involvement of G-protein-coupled receptors. Surprisingly, the DRD2 antagonist domperidone did not counteract the effect of bromocriptine on GSIS, whereas yohimbine, an antagonist of the alpha2-adrenergic receptors, completely abolished bromocriptine-induced inhibition of GSIS. In conclusion, acute administration of bromocriptine inhibits GSIS by a DRD2-independent mechanism involving direct activation of the pancreatic alpha2-adrenergic receptors. We suggest that treatment with bromocriptine promotes beta cells rest, thereby preventing long-lasting hypersecretion of insulin and subsequent beta cell failure.",

Nateglinide inhibited SUR1/Kir6.2 channels with high and low affinities (K(i) = 75 nM and 114 microM) but SUR2A/Kir6.2 and SUR2B/Kir6.2 channels only with low affinity (K(i) = 105 and 111 microM, respectively). Nateglinide inhibited the K(ATP) current mediated by Kir6.2 lacking C-terminal 26 amino acids only with low affinity (K(i) = 290 microM) in the absence of SUR. Replacement of serine at position 1237 of SUR1 to tyrosine [SUR1(S1237Y)] specifically abolished the high-affinity inhibition of SUR1/Kir6.2 channels by nateglinide. MgADP or MgUDP (100 microM) augmented the inhibitory effect of nateglinide on SUR1/Kir6.2 but not SUR1(S1237Y)/Kir6.2 or SUR2A/Kir6.2 channels. This augmenting effect of MgADP was also observed with the SUR1/Kir6.2(K185Q) channel, which was not inhibited by MgADP, but not with the SUR1(K1384A)/Kir6.2 channel, which was not activated by MgADP. These results indicate that therapeutic concentrations of nateglinide (approximately 10 microM) may selectively inhibit pancreatic type SUR1/Kir6.2 channels through SUR1, especially when the channel is activated by intracellular MgADP, even though the agent does not contain either a sulfonylurea or benzamido moiety.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence that adenosine and morphine interact in the striatum. However, little is known about the precise role of the opioid receptor subtypes implicated in the modulation of adenosine tissue concentration and in adenosine receptor expression and function. We sought to evaluate, in the absence of withdrawal symptoms, the effects of the short-term administration of selective mu-, delta- or kappa-opioid receptor agonists on adenosine concentration and on adenosine A(2A) receptor function in rat striatum. Adenosine A(2A) receptor was chosen because the neuronal sub-population expressing this receptor coexpresses enkephalin, suggesting that adenosine A(2A) receptor may be regulated by opioid receptor agonists.

We also investigated the effects of opioid receptor agonists on adenosine uptake by striatal cell extracts. We found that administration of mu- or delta-opioid receptor agonists significantly decreased adenosine uptake in striatal cell extracts and increased adenosine concentration (mean+24% and +45% for mu- and delta-opioid receptor agonist, respectively, relative to controls). None of the receptor agonists tested induced obvious modifications of adenosine A(2A) receptor function. However, the delta-opioid receptor agonist induced an increase in adenosine A(2A) mRNA expression (mean 44%). We conclude that mu and delta receptor agonists inhibit adenosine uptake by striatal cell extracts and increase adenosine concentrations in rat striatum.",

    "title": "5-HT3 receptor antagonists for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. A comparison of their pharmacology and clinical efficacy.",
    "abstract": "In the mid-1980s it was discovered that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) was at least partially responsible for producing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. It was therefore realised that serotonin receptor blockade with serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists could inhibit chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. 5-HT3 antagonists have different chemical structures and receptor binding affinity. Granisetron, dolasetron and its major metabolite are pure 5-HT3 antagonists, while ondansetron and tropisetron are weak antagonists at the 5-HT4 receptor. Ondansetron has also been demonstrated to bind at other serotonin receptors and to the opioid mu receptor. The half-lives of granisetron, tropisetron and the active metabolite of dolasetron are 2 to 3 times longer than that of ondansetron. These observations initially suggested that more frequent ondansetron administration would be required; however, it has now been shown that receptor blockade does not correlate with elimination half-life and all 5-HT3 antagonists can be effectively administered once daily. Clinical trials have been conducted that directly compare the 5-HT3 antagonists. To compare these studies, it is necessary to assess trial design, including known risk factors for the development of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and response criteria. Stratification for risk factors, use of strict efficacy criteria and randomisation to a blinded trial using an appropriate comparative regimen are essential for a well designed antiemetic trial. Comparative clinical trials using various doses, routes and regimens of administration have been conducted with 5-HT3 antagonists. Despite some trial design shortcomings, most of the studies show equal efficacy between the agents, especially in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and mild, infrequently occurring adverse effects. The addition of steroids also appears to improve outcome. However, since many doses and regimens of ondansetron were used, further study is needed to determine the optimal regimen. The efficacy of 5-HT3 antagonists in controlling delayed nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy is less well studied. Further, there is no good scientific rationale for the use of 5-HT3 antagonists in controlling delayed nausea and vomiting since serotonin has not been shown to be released during the delayed phase. In fact, most studies show no benefit or modest benefit of 5-HT3 antagonists over placebo. Because the 5-HT3 antagonists perform similarly in the clinical setting, pharmacological differences do not seem to translate into therapeutic differences. There is also no appreciable difference in the incidence or severity of adverse effects among the 5-HT3 antagonists. Determination of clinical use may then be driven by cost.",

    "abstract": "The relative binding affinities (RBAs) of four progestational compounds (norethisterone, levonorgestrel, 3-keto-desogestrel and gestodene) for the human progesterone and androgen receptors were measured in MCF-7 cytosol and intact MCF-7 cells. For the binding to the progesterone receptor, both Org 2058 and Org 3236 (or 3-keto-desogestrel) were used as labelled ligands. The following ranking (low to high) for the RBA of the nuclear (intact cells) progesterone receptor irrespective of the ligand used is found: norethisterone much less than levonorgestrel less than 3-keto-destogestrel less than gestodene. The difference between the various progestagens is significant with the exception of that between 3-keto-desogestrel and gestodene, when Org 2058 is used as ligand. For the cytosolic progesterone receptor, the same order is found with the exception that similar RBAs are found for gestodene and 3-keto-desogestrel. The four progestagens clearly differ with respect to binding to the androgen receptor using dihydrotestosterone as labelled ligand in intact cells; the ranking (low to high) is: norethisterone less than 3 keto-desogestrel less than levonorgestrel and gestodene. The difference between 3-keto-desogestrel and levonorgestrel or gestodene is significant. The selectivity indices (ratio of the mean RBA for the progesterone receptor to that of androgen receptor) in intact cells are significantly higher for 3-keto-desogestrel and gestodene than for levonorgestrel and norethisterone. From these results we conclude that the introduction of the 18-methyl in norethisterone (levonorgestel) increases both the binding to the progesterone and androgen receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) are a leading cause of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the general population. Alterations in norepinephrine and serotonin systems have been proposed as mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of the condition, with treatment directed at these neurotransmitter systems. Reboxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, exhibits high affinity and selectivity for the human norepinephrine transporter. Inasmuch as PTSD may be associated with dysregulation of noradrenergic activity, the present double-blind randomized clinical trial intended to evaluate reboxetine's efficacy in the management of MVA-related PTSD and to compare its efficacy with a medication commonly used in PTSD, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine. METHODS: Forty patients with MVA-related PTSD attending a local community mental health outpatient clinic were randomized to receive a fixed dose of either reboxetine (8 mg/d) or fluvoxamine (150 mg/d) in a double-blind fashion for a period of 8 weeks. RESULTS: At baseline and at study end point, the 2 subgroups demonstrated no statistical differences in scores on PTSD, depression, and anxiety rating scales. Both medications led to significant improvements in all clinical scales measured. Nine patients receiving reboxetine and 3 receiving fluvoxamine withdrew from the study because of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Study observations indicate comparable efficacy of reboxetine and fluvoxamine in the management of MVA-related PTSD despite reboxetine's selective noradrenergic activity. Reboxetine appears to be at least as effective as fluvoxamine and may offer an alternative management option in this often difficult-to-treat and disabling condition. A lower and flexible reboxetine dosing schedule will be recommended for future research to improve its tolerability in PTSD patients.",

    "abstract": "FLT3 (fms-related tyrosine kinase/Flk2/Stk-2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) primarily expressed on hematopoietic cells. In blasts from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, 2 classes of FLT3 activating mutations have been identified: internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (25%-30% of patients) and point mutations in the kinase domain activation loop (7%-8% of patients). FLT3-ITD mutations are the most common molecular defect identified in AML and have been shown to be an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival. FLT3-ITD is therefore an attractive molecular target for therapy. SU11248 is a recently described selective inhibitor with selectivity for split kinase domain RTKs, including platelet-derived growth factor receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and KIT. We show that SU11248 also has potent activity against wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT), FLT3-ITD, and FLT3 activation loop (FLT3-Asp835) mutants in phosphorylation assays. SU11248 inhibits FLT3-driven phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in vitro. In addition, SU11248 inhibits FLT3-induced VEGF production. The in vivo efficacy of SU11248 was investigated in 2 FLT3-ITD models: a subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and a bone marrow engraftment model. We show that SU11248 (20 mg/kg/d) dramatically regresses FLT3-ITD tumors in the subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and prolongs survival in the bone marrow engraftment model. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis in subcutaneous tumors showed that a single administration of an efficacious drug dose potently inhibits FLT3-ITD phosphorylation for up to 16 hours following a single dose. These results suggest that further exploration of SU11248 activity in AML patients is warranted.",

Several of MCD clinical manifestations resemble those of infant malnutrition; we demonstrated that about one-third of infants with this common nutritional disorder were indeed biotin-deficient, and that this deficiency is metabolically significant, by studying urine instead of blood, studying urinary organic acids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Remarkably, the metabolic abnormalities became apparent only after protein feeding was started, suggesting that this phenomenon may contribute to the worsening of malnourished individuals when they are abruptly fed. Afterwards, we studied biotin deficiency at the tissue level. Carboxylase activities and masses were significantly reduced in liver, kidney, muscle, adipose tissue, intestine, and spleen, but brain and heart were spared; their mRNAs remained unchanged. On the other hand, holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) mRNA levels were markedly low in the deficient animals, and increased upon biotin injection. Over 2000 human genes have been identified that depend on biotin for expression. To probe into the \"logic\" of this enigma, we have started comparative studies among evolutionarily distant organisms, such as mouse and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and we are now looking for biotin effects on specific genes and proteins, such as HCS and hexokinases, and on their proteomes.",

    "abstract": "The role of protein kinase C and intracellular Ca(2+) on amphetamine-mediated dopamine release through the norepinephrine plasmalemmal transporter in undifferentiated PC12 cells was investigated. The selective protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine completely inhibited endogenous dopamine release elicited by 1 microM amphetamine. Direct activation of protein kinase C increased dopamine release in a Ca(2+)-insensitive, imipramine-sensitive manner and the release was not additive with amphetamine. Exocytosis was not involved since these events were not altered by either deletion of extracellular Ca(2+) or reserpine pretreatment. Down-regulation of protein kinase C activity by long-term phorbol ester treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in amphetamine-mediated dopamine release with no apparent effect on [(3)H]dopamine uptake. To more completely examine a role for Ca(2+), intracellular Ca(2+) was chelated in the cells. Depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) considerably decreased dopamine release in response to 1 microM amphetamine compared with vehicle-treated cells, but had no effect on the [(3)H]dopamine uptake. Thus, our results suggest that amphetamine-mediated dopamine release through the plasmalemmal norepinephrine transporter is highly dependent on protein kinase C activity and intracellular but not extracellular Ca(2+). Furthermore, protein kinase C and intracellular Ca(2+) appear to regulate [(3)H]dopamine inward transport and amphetamine-mediated outward transport of dopamine independently in PC12 cells.",

The duration was longer with an increased bronchodilation (P less than 0.01) 6 h after D2343 inhalation compared with terbutaline. The mean fall in FEV1 3-6 h after inhalation was significantly greater with terbutaline than with D2343 (P less than 0.05).

    "title": "Emerging drugs for acromegaly.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acromegaly is due to growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion by a benign pituitary tumor (adenoma). Treatments include surgical removal of the adenoma (often incomplete when the tumor is large and/or invasive), radiotherapy of the pituitary region (sometimes effective only after &gt; 10 years, and potentially causing cerebrovascular disease), and medical therapy. METHODS: The scope of this article is to review the efficacy and safety of currently marketed drugs and to discuss the interest of new compounds. For this purpose, critical analysis of original articles and reviews was made and manufacturers were asked to provide all data that have been presented in congress and are not yet published. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Somatostatin analogs (first octreotide and then lanreotide) have been used for 20 years to treat patients in whom surgery and/or radiotherapy has failed, and also as first-line therapy when other modalities are contraindicated or are unlikely to control GH and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) hypersecretion. Long-lasting formulations, requiring only one monthly injection, have greatly improved the convenience of these treatments. GH/IGF-I hypersecretion is controlled by these drugs in about 50% of patients, but the remaining patients require another treatment. Pegvisomant, a drug belonging to a totally different therapeutic class (GH-receptor antagonists) with a different mode of action, is effective in most of these patients. According to current research goals, new developmental drugs include new somatostatin analogs (SAs) with different somatostatin receptor selectivity, and chimeric molecules that are able to bind to both somatostatin and dopamine receptors.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxic chemoreception in the carotid body involves selective inhibition of K+ channels in type I cells. We have investigated whether cytochrome P-450 may act as an O2 sensor coupling hypoxia to K+ channel inhibition, by investigating the actions of P-450 inhibitors to modulate channel activity (recorded using patch-clamp techniques) in type I cells isolated from 8-to 12-day-old rat pups. The imidazole antimycotic P-450 inhibitors miconazole and clotrimazole (1-10 microM) inhibited the Ca(2+)-activated (KCa) and voltage-gated K+ (Kv) currents in isolated type I cells. Single-channel recordings indicated that the KCa channels could be inhibited directly by miconazole. Miconazole also irreversibly inhibited Ca2+ channel currents. By contrast, acute application of the suicide substrate P-450 inhibitor, 1-aminobenzotriazole (1-ABT; 3 mM) was without effect on K+ or Ca2+ currents. Hypoxia (16-23 mmHg) reversibly inhibited K+ currents and prevented the inhibitory actions of miconazole. Furthermore, the inhibitory actions of miconazole could be partially reversed by hypoxia. Pretreatment of cells for 60 min with 3 mM 1-ABT substantially reduced the inhibitory actions of hypoxia on K+ currents. Our results indicate that imidazole antimycotic P-450 inhibitors can directly and nonselectively inhibit ionic channels in type I cells but, more importantly, provide evidence to suggest that hypoxic inhibition of K+ currents in type I cells is mediated in part at least by cytochrome P-450.",

    "title": "Serotonin 5-HT2C receptors as a target for the treatment of depressive and anxious states: focus on novel therapeutic strategies.",
    "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT)2C receptors play an important role in the modulation of monoaminergic transmission, mood, motor behaviour, appetite and endocrine secretion, and alterations in their functional status have been detected in anxiodepressive states. Further, 5-HT2C sites are involved in the actions of several classes of antidepressant. At the onset of treatment, indirect activation of 5-HT2C receptors participates in the anxiogenic effects of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as well as their inhibition of sleep, sexual behaviour and appetite. Conversely, progressive down-regulation of 5-HT2C receptors parallels the gradual onset of clinical efficacy of SSRIs. Other antidepressants, such as nefazodone or mirtazapine, act as direct antagonists of 5-HT2C receptors. These observations underpin interest in 5-HT2C receptor blockade as a strategy for treating depressive and anxious states. This notion is supported by findings that 5-HT2C receptor antagonists stimulate dopaminergic and adrenergic pathways, exert antidepressant and anxiolytic actions in behavioural paradigms, and favour sleep and sexual function. In addition to selective antagonists, novel strategies for exploitation of 5-HT2C receptors embrace inverse agonists, allosteric modulators, ligands of homo/heterodimers, modulators of interactions with 'postsynaptic proteins', dual melatonin agonists/5-HT2C receptor antagonists and mixed 5-HT2C/alpha2-adrenergic antagonists. Intriguingly, there is evidence that stimulation of regionally discrete populations of 5-HT2C receptors is effective in certain behavioural models of antidepressant activity, and promotes neurogenesis in the hippocampus. This article explains how these ostensibly paradoxical actions of 5-HT2C antagonists and agonists can be reconciled and discusses both established and innovative strategies for the exploitation of 5-HT2C receptors in the improved management of depressed and anxious states.",

    "abstract": "Etoposide is a phase-specific, schedule-dependent derivative of podophyllotoxin that appears to act by inhibiting DNA-topoisomerase II. Early preclinical work demonstrated sharp activity in mouse leukemias and possible synergy with cisplatin. As a single agent (either orally or intravenously), it demonstrated limited benefit in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with response rates around 10%. In combination with cisplatin, it has become a mainstay of chemotherapeutic efforts, either as primary therapy or in conjunction with radiation. Response rates in advanced disease average around 30%, climbing to more than 50% in patients with Stage IIIA or IIIB disease. More recent work suggests that the issue of the true synergy of etoposide with cisplatin in NSCLC needs reassessment. The relative roles of etoposide and cisplatin in the combination are unclear, as several studies conflict. Pharmacokinetic data suggest that multiple daily fractions of etoposide are superior to prolonged infusions, warranting several future trials. The current major role for etoposide plus cisplatin would appear to be in multimodality therapy where the combination can be readily combined with radiation and/or surgery. Several other agents have been studied with etoposide or etoposide plus cisplatin (mitomycin, vindesine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin), but it is unclear whether the addition of any of them offers any response or survival advantage.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) induces estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive ductal invasive mammary carcinomas in BALB/c mice. We sought to reproduce this MPA cancer model in C57BL/6 mice because of their widespread use in genetic engineering. Within this experimental setting, we studied the carcinogenic effects of MPA, the morphologic changes in mammary glands that are induced by MPA and progesterone, and the levels of ER and PR expression in MPA-treated and progesterone-treated mammary glands. Finally, we evaluated whether the differences found between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse strains were due to intrinsic differences in epithelial cells. METHODS: The carcinogenic effect of MPA was evaluated in C57BL/6 mice using protocols proven to be carcinogenic in BALB/c mice. In addition, BALB/c and C57BL/6 females were treated with progesterone or MPA for 1 or 2 months, and mammary glands were excised for histologic studies and for immunohistochemical and Western blot evaluation of ER and PR. Hormone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Isolated mammary epithelial cells were transplanted into cleared fat pads of 21-day-old female Swiss nu/nu mice or control congenic animals. RESULTS: MPA failed to induce mammary carcinomas or significant morphologic changes in the mammary glands of C57BL/6 mice. The expression of ER-alpha and PR isoform A in virgin mice was surprisingly much higher in BALB/c than in C57BL/6 mammary glands, and both receptors were downregulated in progestin-treated BALB/c mice (P &lt; 0.05). PR isoform B levels were low in virgin control mice and increased after progestin treatment in both strains. ER-beta expression followed a similar trend. No differences in hormone levels were found between strains. Surprisingly, the transplantation of the epithelial mammary gland cells of both strains into the cleared fat pads of Swiss (nu/nu) mice abolished the mammary gland morphologic differences and the ER and PR differences between strains. CONCLUSION: C57BL/6 mammary glands are resistant to MPA-induced carcinogenesis and to hormone action. MPA and progesterone have different effects on mammary glands. Low ER-alpha and PR-A levels in untreated mammary glands may be associated with a low-risk breast cancer profile. Although we cannot at this time rule out the participation of other, untested factors, our findings implicate the stroma as playing a crucial role in the strain-specific differential hormone receptor expression and hormone responsiveness.",

To further investigate this positive correlation and its possible therapeutic implications, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, etodolac, was tested on three variants of HT-29 colon cancer cell lines, HT-29/Inv1, HT-29/Inv2 and HT-29/Inv3, with graded increases of in vitro Matrigel invasive potential and COX-2 expression levels. HT-29 variants with higher invasive potential were found to be more sensitive to etodolac by in vitro growth inhibition assays, the estimated LD(50) being 0.5 mM for highly invasive HT-29/Inv2 and HT-29/Inv3 cells, 0.6 mM for slightly less invasive HT-29/Inv1, and 1.8 mM for the parental HT-29. Treatment of the highly invasive HT-29/Inv2 and Inv3 variants with as little as 0.1 mM etodolac in the growth medium produced signs of apoptosis, as detected by DNA fragmentation and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) assay. In vivo experiments in SCID mice showed that etolodac inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors induced by HT-29/Inv3 cells significantly more than those by the parental HT-29 cells. These results suggest that COX-2 inhibitors have a potential role in prevention of tumor invasion in colon cancer patients.",

The present study examined the long-term effects of a selective MMP inhibitor PG-530742 (PG) on the progression of LV dysfunction and remodeling in dogs with HF. Chronic HF [LV ejection fraction (LVEF), &lt;/=36%] was produced by multiple sequential intracoronary microembolizations in 24 dogs. Two weeks after the last embolization, dogs were randomized to 3 mo of therapy with either high-dose (HD) PG (3.5 mg/kg, n = 8), low-dose (LD) PG (0.2 mg/kg, n = 8), or to a matched placebo (PL, n = 8). PG has been shown to produce complete inhibition of MMP-2, -3, -9, and -13, while sparing MMPs-1 and -7. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements were made before and 3 mo after initiating therapy. In PL and LD dogs, LVEF decreased significantly, and LV end-systolic volume (ESV) and LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) increased significantly during the 3-mo follow-up period. Whereas in HD dogs ejection fraction increased from 36 +/- 1 to 40 +/- 1% (P = 0.003), EDV and ESV decreased (59 +/- 4 vs. 57 +/- 4 ml, P = 0.02; and 38 +/- 2 vs. 34 +/- 2 ml, P = 0.00001, respectively). When compared with controls, HD-treated dogs showed 30% reduction in replacement fibrosis, 29% reduction in interstitial fibrosis, and 28% reduction in myocyte cross-sectional area. mRNA expression of selective MMPs was also reduced in LV tissue in HD- but not LD-treated dogs. In conclusion, in dogs with moderate HF, long-term monotherapy with HD selective MMP inhibitor PG prevents LV remodeling and the progression of global LV dysfunction.",

The effect of trimebutine on the voltage-dependent inward Ca2+ current was investigated by the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique in single smooth muscle cells from rabbit ileum. 2. Trimebutine (3-100 microM) reduced the Ca2+ current in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect on the Ca2+ current was also dependent on the holding potential. The Ca2+ current after a low holding potential was inhibited to a greater extent than that after a high membrane potential: the IC50 values were 7 microM and 36 microM at holding potentials of -40 mV and -60 mV, respectively. The Ca2+ current elicited from a holding potential of -80 mV could not be reduced by as much as 50% of the control by trimebutine at concentrations as high as 100 microM. 3. Trimebutine (30 microM) shifted the voltage-dependent inactivation curve for the Ca2+ current by 18 mV in the negative direction. The affinity of the drug for Ca2+ channels was calculated to be 36 times higher in the inactivated state than in the closed-available state. 4. Blockade of the Ca2+ current by trimebutine, unlike verapamil, was not use-dependent. 5. The results suggest that trimebutine inhibits the voltage-dependent inward Ca2+ current through a preferential binding to Ca2+ channels in the inactivated state in the smooth muscle cell from rabbit ileum. The inhibitory effect of trimebutine on gastrointestinal motility is discussed in the light of the present findings.",

    "title": "Minocycline reduces traumatic brain injury-mediated caspase-1 activation, tissue damage, and neurological dysfunction.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Caspase-1 plays an important functional role mediating neuronal cell death and dysfunction after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice. Minocycline, a derivative of the antibiotic tetracycline, inhibits caspase-1 expression. This study investigates whether minocycline can ameliorate TBI-mediated injury in mice. METHODS: Brains from mice subjected to traumatic brain injury underwent immunohistochemical analyses for caspase-1, caspase-3, and a neuronal specific marker (NeuN). Minocycline- and saline-treated mice subjected to traumatic brain injury were compared with respect to neurological function, lesion volume, and interleukin-1beta production. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that activated caspase-1 and caspase-3 are present in neurons 24 hours after TBI. Intraperitoneal administration of minocycline 12 hours before or 30 minutes after TBI in mice resulted in improved neurological function when compared with mice given saline control, as assessed by Rotarod performance 1 to 4 days after TBI. The lesion volume, assessed 4 days after trauma, was significantly decreased in mice treated with minocycline before or after trauma when compared with saline-treated mice. Caspase-1 activity, quantified by measuring mature interleukin-1beta production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was considerably increased in mice that underwent TBI, and this increase was significantly diminished in minocycline-treated mice. CONCLUSION: We show for the first time that caspase-1 and caspase-3 activities localize specifically within neurons after experimental brain trauma. Further, these results indicate that minocycline is an effective pharmacological agent for reducing tissue injury and neurological deficits that result from experimental TBI, likely through a caspase-1-dependent mechanism. These results provide an experimental rationale for the evaluation of minocycline in human trauma patients.",

    "abstract": "The folate receptor (FR), an essential component in the process of folate uptake in various cells, is known to exist in three isoforms, FR-alpha, FR-beta and FR-gamma, with differential tissue expression. Transfer of folate across the human placenta from mother to fetus involves participation of a folate receptor expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast, but the isoform identity of this receptor has not been established. Based on the tissue/cell type from which these isoforms have been cloned, it is currently believed that FR-alpha is the isoform expressed in adult tissues whereas FR-beta is the isoform expressed in fetal tissues including placenta. The present study, undertaken primarily to establish the isoform identity of the FR expressed in the placental syncytiotrophoblast, does not support this currently prevailing nomenclature. Reverse transcription coupled with polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of total/poly(A)+ RNA from placenta, cultured trophoblast cells and JAR choriocarcinoma cells with primer pairs specific for either FR-alpha or FR-beta reveals that while both isoforms are detectable in the whole placental tissue, only FR-alpha is present in the normal trophoblast cells and in the choriocarcinoma cells. Northern analysis with probes designed to distinguish between the mRNA transcripts coding for these two isoforms corroborate the RT-PCR findings. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of the PCR products obtained from the trophoblast cells and JAR cells are identical to the nucleotide sequence of the FR-alpha cDNA. These studies establish that it is the FR-alpha isoform, and not the FR-beta isoform, which is selectively expressed in the placental trophoblast cells. FR-beta, which is known to be present in the placenta, most likely arises from the maternal decidua normally associated with this tissue.",

    "abstract": "The malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum can only synthesize pyrimidine nucleotides via the de novo pathway which is therefore a suitable target for development of antimalarial drugs. New assay procedures have been developed using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) which enable concurrent measurement of pyrimidine intermediates in malaria. Synchronized parasites growing in erythrocytes were pulse-labeled with [14C]bicarbonate at 6-h intervals around the 48-h asexual life cycle. Analysis of malarial extracts by HPLC showed tht incorporation of [14C]bicarbonate into pyrimidine nucleotides was maximal during the transition from trophozoites to schizonts. The reaction, N-carbamyl-L-aspartate--&gt;L-dihydroorotate (CA-asp--&gt;DHO) catalyzed by malarial dihydroorotase is inhibited by L-6-thiodihydroorotate (TDHO) in vitro (Ki = 6.5 microM), and TDHO, as the free acid or methyl ester, induces a major accumulation of CA-asp in malaria. Atovaquone, a naphthoquinone, is a moderate inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in vitro (Ki = 27 microM) but induces major accumulations of CA-asp and DHO. Pyrazofurin induces accumulation of orotate and orotidine in malaria, consistent with inhibition of orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase with subsequent dephosphorylation of the OMP accumulated. Although TDHO, atovaquone, and pyrazofurin arrest the growth of P. falciparum, only moderate decreases in UTP, CTP, and dTTP were observed. 5-Fluoroorotate also arrests the growth of P. falciparum with major accumulations of 5-fluorouridine mono-, di-, and triphosphates and the most significant inhibition of de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides.",

The two most promising compounds (7rh and 7rj) inhibited the enzymatic activity of DDR1, with IC50 values of 6.8 and 7.0 nM, respectively, but were significantly less potent in suppressing the kinase activities of DDR2, Bcr-Abl, and c-Kit. Further study revealed that 7rh bound with DDR1 with a Kd value of 0.6 nM, while it was significantly less potent to the other 455 kinases tested. The S(35) and S(10) selectivity scores of 7rh were 0.035 and 0.008, respectively. The compounds also potently inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells expressing high levels of DDR1 and strongly suppressed cancer cell invasion, adhesion, and tumorigenicity. Preliminary pharmacokinetic studies suggested that they possessed good PK profiles, with oral bioavailabilities of 67.4% and 56.2%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Male Fischer-344 rats (n = 38) at 5 months old were tested in a Morris water maze to determine if treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitor, phenserine (PHEN), would overcome a learning impairment induced by scopolamine (SCOP), a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist. Each rat was randomly assigned to one of five groups to receive two intraperitoneal injections 60 and 30 min, prior to testing, respectively, as follows: (1) saline-saline (SAL); (2) saline-1.0 mg/kg (SCOP); (3) 2 mg/kg PHEN- SCOP (PHEN2); (4) 4 mg/kg PHEN-SCOP (PHEN4); and (5) 1 mg/kg PHEN-SAL (PHEN1). Maze testing occurred across 5 days with 4 days of acquisition trials (4 trials per day) and a fifth day consisting of a single 120 sec probe trial. PHEN1 and SAL were combined into one control (CON) group for purposes of statistical analysis for both acquisition and probe trials as comparison of the two groups revealed that they did not significantly differ on any measure. SCOP-treated rats were significantly impaired compared to CON in learning the location of the submerged platform as measured by latency to locate the platform and the distance traversed to find the platform across days of testing. The PHEN4 group had significantly lower latencies and traveled a shorter distance to reach the submerged platform when compared to SCOP on the fourth day of trials while the PHEN2 group traveled more directly to the submerged platform but did not have shorter latencies than the SCOP group. For probe trials, CON rats swam closer to the target area (a measure of proximity to the removed platform) than did all other groups, and the PHEN4 group swam in an area more proximate to the target area than did the SCOP-treated group. These findings demonstrate the ability of this drug to improve learning when cholinergic function has been impaired in a spatial memory task.",

    "abstract": "We examined the hyperthermic and lethal toxic effects of methamphetamine in dopamine transporter (DAT) and/or serotonin transporter (SERT) knockout (KO) mice. Methamphetamine (45 mg/kg) caused significant hyperthermia even in the mice with a single DAT gene copy and no SERT copies (DAT+/- SERT-/- mice). Mice with no DAT copies and a single SERT gene copy (DAT-/- SERT+/- mice) showed significant but reduced hyperthermia when compared to wild-type mice after methamphetamine. Surprisingly, DAT/SERT double KO mice exhibited a paradoxical hypothermia after methamphetamine. These results demonstrate that methamphetamine exerts a hyperthermic effect via DAT, or via SERT, in the absence of DAT. The selective norepinephrine transporter blocker (20 mg/kg nisoxetine) caused hyperthermia in DAT/SERT double KO mice, suggesting that the norepinephrine system is not responsible for methamphetamine-induced paradoxical hypothermia in the double KO mice. DAT gene deletion in mice strikingly increased LD50 of methamphetamine by 1.7-1.8 times that of wild-type mice, suggesting that the lethal toxic effect of methamphetamine is mainly dependent on DAT. Moreover, dissociation between hyperthermic and lethal toxic effects of methamphetamine in DAT single KO mice and DAT/SERT double KO mice suggest that hyperthermia is not a prerequisite for methamphetamine-induced lethality. Methamphetamine (45 mg/kg) significantly increased mRNA of interleukin-1beta, which is the major endogenous pyrogen, in the hypothalamus of wild-type mice but not in DAT/SERT double KO mice, which provides a partial mechanism of methamphetamine-induced paradoxical hypothermia. These results suggest that DAT and SERT are key molecules for hyperthermic and lethal toxic effects of methamphetamine.",

    "title": "Modulation of HERG potassium channels by extracellular magnesium and quinidine.",
    "abstract": "Torsades de pointes is a polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia resulting from congenital or drug-induced (acquired) QT prolongation. Pharmacologic suppression of repolarizing potassium currents is one mechanism causing the acquired long QT (LQT) syndrome. Recent studies have linked mutations in a gene encoding a potassium channel subunit (HERG) to the LQT syndrome. Clinical experience indicates that intravenous magnesium sulfate is effective in reversing torsades de pointes, but the molecular basis of this effect is not understood. This study was designed to investigate the effects of extracellular magnesium (Mg2+) on HERG potassium currents. HERG potassium channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and in a human cell line and were examined by voltage-clamp methods. Extracellular Mg2+ (0.3-10 mM) caused a concentration-dependent shift in the membrane-potential dependence of HERG channel opening, causing a reduction in K+ current. This effect was much greater than that observed in another human delayed rectifier K+ channel, hKv1.5, suggesting a specific interaction with the HERG channel. Quinidine is an antiarrhythmic drug that also causes torsades de pointes under certain conditions. Quinidine (3 microM) inhibited HERG currents expressed in oocytes by 32.1 +/- 3.2% (n = 5), whereas 1 microM quinidine inhibited HERG currents in tsA201 cells by 75.8 +/- 2.4% (n = 12). Increasing extracellular Mg2+ did not relieve the inhibition by quinidine, but caused additional suppression. These results indicate that extracellular Mg2+ exerts a direct action on HERG potassium channels, resulting in suppression of outward repolarizing potassium current. It is concluded that modulation of this important K+ current is not the mechanism by which intravenous magnesium terminates drug-induced LQT and torsades de pointes. Potent suppression of HERG channel current by quinidine, compared with that of I(Ks) and I(Na), is a likely contributor to torsades de pointes arrhythmias.",

    "abstract": "The major side effects of racemic oxybutynin (OXY), which is used in the treatment of urinary incontinence are dry mouth (xerostomia) and blurred vision (mydriasis). Highly purified enantiomers of OXY [(R)OXY, (S)OXY] were compared with the racemate both in vitro in functional studies and in vivo in guinea pigs to evaluate their pharmacological action relative to their adverse effects. The affinity of (R)OXY and (S)OXY for different muscarinic receptor subtypes was determined using field stimulated rabbit vas deferens (M1) and guinea pig atria (M2) or bladder (M3) strips. Stereoselective antimuscarinic effects [(R)OXY greater than or equal to (R/S) OXY much greater than (S)OXY] were evident at all three receptor subtypes; the isomeric ratio [(S)OXY/(R)OXY] ranged from 12 to 88. Both (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY were slightly more selective (2-4-fold, P less than .01) for M1 and M3 relative to M2 muscarinic receptors. Stereoselectivity was also evident in vivo for volume-induced urinary bladder contractions as measured by cystometrogram parameters [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 21], mydriasis [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 136] and salivary gland secretory responses [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 30]. The absolute potencies of (R)OXY or (R/S)OXY for mydriasis and salivation were similar to those for inhibition of intravesical bladder pressure. Also, (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY equipotently antagonized cholinergic-mediated CNS effects in mice. Collectively, the data suggest that the activity of (R/S)OXY resides predominantly in the (R)-enantiomer. However, it appears that (R)OXY may offer no significant pharmacological advantage over (R/S)OXY in terms of its principal therapeutic and side effect profile.",

    "abstract": "1. The effect of diazoxide, an opener of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) has been investigated in the rat hippocampal slices by the use of extracellular and intracellular recording techniques. 2. In control solution, diazoxide enhanced the CA1 and CA3 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and produced interictal activities in CA3. These effects were neither prevented by KATP blockers, including glibenclamide (3-30 microM) or tolbutamide (500 microM), nor mimicked by another KATP opener such as galanine (1 microM); thus these effects are probably not mediated by KATP channels. 3. Using intracellular recording, we then studied, in CA3 pyramidal neurons, the effect of diazoxide on the EPSPs and the fast and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). 4. In presence of bicuculline (10 microM) and phaclofen (50 microM), to block, respectively, fast and slow IPSPs, diazoxide reversibly enhanced the EPSPs. 5. In presence of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 10 microM), to block EPSPs, diazoxide reversibly decreased both fast and slow IPSPs. 6. These effects of diazoxide on the EPSPs and fast and slow IPSPs were associated neither with a change of the reversal potential of the EPSPs or the fast and slow IPSPs nor with a change of the input resistance and membrane potential. 7. Using single electrode voltage-clamp technique, we then tested the effects of diazoxide on the currents generated by applications of glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -A and -B analogues. 8. In presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 microM), diazoxide reversibly enhanced the peak currents evoked by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionate (AMPA; 3-5 microM), quisqualate (5-10 microM) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 10 microM), but not those evoked by kainate (1-3 microM). 9. In presence of TTX (1 microM), diazoxide reversibly decreased the GABA- (1-5 mM), isoguvacine- (30-60 microM), and baclofen- (10-30 microM) mediated peak currents. 10. It is concluded that, in the hippocampus, diazoxide enhances the excitatory glutamatergic currents and reduces the GABAergic inhibition, thus generating paroxystic activities. We suggest that these effects are mediated by second messenger cascades.",

The investigation showed that sarpogrelate (10(-7)-10(-5) M) had a weak antagonistic effect on 5-HT-induced relaxation and its effect was weaker than that of ritanserin (10(-9)-10(-7) M) and cyproheptadine (10(-8)-10(-6) M). The rank order of the antagonistic effects was: ritanserin &gt; cyproheptadine &gt; sarpogrelate. The study also showed that both sarpogrelate and ritanserin had no inhibitory effect on bradykinin-induced relaxation. In our previous study, we investigated the binding affinity of sarpogrelate, ritanserin and cyproheptadine to the 5-HT2A-receptor in rabbit cerebral cortex membranes and the pKi values found were 7.22, 8.98 and 7.54, respectively (M.

Thus, these findings suggest that sarpogrelate has the lowest antagonistic effect on 5-HT-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation and the highest selectivity towards 5-HT2A receptor and might also be the safest drug with respect to its clinical implications in comparison with ritanserin and cyproheptadine.",

    "abstract": "The questions raised are: what is the physiological or pharmacological basis for the differentiation into beta 1- and beta 2-, and alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors?; and do the neurotransmitter norepinephrine and the hormone epinephrine differ in their receptors? On the basis of a preference of beta 2- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors for epinephrine, the hormone, and of beta 1-and alpha 1-receptors for norepinephrine, the neurotransmitter, it was postulated that the alpha 2- and beta 2-receptors are predominantly epinephrinergic in nature and located extrajunctionally and presynaptically whereas the alpha 1- and beta 1-receptors are predominantly norepinephrinergic in nature and located postsynaptically in the sympathetic terminal junction. The alpha 2- and beta 2-character of the presynaptic receptors matches that of the corresponding extrajunctional receptors. This indicates that a circulating catecholamine, namely epinephrine, is involved in the regulation of adrenergic transmitter release.",

    "abstract": "The action of hydralazine on collagen prolyl hydroxylation was studied in a cell culture system using WI-38 fibroblasts. The prolyl hydroxylation level was determined by a method involving the digestion of collagen by bacterial collagenase and the examination of specific peptides. The presence of low concentrations of hydralazine (0.2 mM) in both \"young\" and \"old\" fibroblast cultures strongly inhibited collagen prolyl hydroxylation. The degree of inhibition was greater in serum-deficient cultures. No significant improvement in the degree of hydroxylation was observed by increasing either ascorbate or iron levels in the hydralazine-containing cultures in which hydroxylation was inhibited. Some of the reported side effects of hydralazine seen in patients might be related to its inhibitory effects on mixed function oxidative (MFO) hydroxylation systems. While the ascorbate dependence of the prolyl hydroxylase system of WI-38 decreased with the \"age\" of the culture, hydralazine inhibition of hydroxylation was dramatic with cultures of all \"ages\".",

    "abstract": "E7080 is an orally active inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including VEGF, FGF and SCF receptors. In this study, we show the inhibitory activity of E7080 against SCF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and tumor growth of SCF-producing human small cell lung carcinoma H146 cells in vivo. E7080 inhibits SCF-driven tube formation of HUVEC, which express SCF receptor, KIT at the IC(50) value of 5.2 nM and it was almost identical for VEGF-driven one (IC(50) = 5.1 nM). To assess the role of SCF/KIT signaling in tumor angiogenesis, we evaluated the effect of imatinib, a selective KIT kinase inhibitor, on tumor growth of H146 cells in nude mice. Imatinib did not show the potent antitumor activity in vitro (IC(50) = 2,200 nM), because H146 cells did not express KIT. However, oral administration of imatinib at 160 mg/kg clearly slowed tumor growth of H146 cells in nude mice, accompanied by decreased microvessel density. Oral administration of E7080 inhibited tumor growth of H146 cells at doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg in a dose-dependent manner and caused tumor regression at 100 mg/kg. While anti-VEGF antibody also slowed tumor growth, it did not cause tumor regression. These results indicate that KIT signaling has a role in tumor angiogenesis of SCF-producing H146 cells, and E7080 causes regression of H146 tumors as a result of antiangiogenic activity mediated by inhibition of both KIT and VEGF receptor signaling. E7080 may provide therapeutic benefits in the treatment of SCF-producing tumors.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised a single-blind and randomized design with tamsulosin or terazosin taken once daily for 8 weeks. A total of 98 patients was enrolled, with 72 patients included in the analyses after 4 and 8 weeks. The primary variables assessed were changes in the maximum urinary flow rate Qmax and the total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), with the post-void residual urine volume, 'obstructive' and 'irritative' questions in the IPSS, and the investigators' global assessment of efficacy also determined. The number of patients with a clinically significant response to treatment with tamsulosin or terazosin was determined and defined as those with &gt; 20% improvement from the baseline Qmax or &gt; 20% decrease in total IPSS. Adverse reactions possibly or probably related to study medication were recorded throughout the treatment period. RESULTS: Both tamsulosin and terazosin produced similar significant improvements in subjective and objective symptoms of urinary outflow obstruction (P &gt; 0.05). Systolic and diastolic (standing) blood pressures decreased significantly in patients treated with terazosin (P &lt; 0.05). The adverse reactions, most frequently dry mouth and dizziness which were usually mild and transient, were significantly higher in patients on terazosin (18 patients, versus one on tamsulosin, P &lt; 0.001). The changes led to discontinuation of therapy in two patients on terazosin. CONCLUSION: Tamsulosin was as effective as terazosin in treating urinary outflow obstruction associated with BPH, but had a markedly better safety profile.",

    "abstract": "Diverse drugs from many therapeutic classes exert cardiotoxic side effects by inducing torsades de pointes (TdP), a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia, which often results from drug interaction with HERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) encoded K(+) channels, that generate an I(Kr) component of the delayed rectifier cardiac K(+) current. Men are known to be at a lower risk for drug-induced TdP than women suggesting a role of sex steroid hormones, androgens and estrogens, in modulation of drug sensitivity of cardiac K(+) channels, particularly those encoded by HERG. Here by using neuroleptic agents haloperidol, pimozide, and fluspirilene, all of which can induce TdP, and a steroid hormone-sensitive system Xenopus oocytes for HERG channels expression we show that testosterone is able to reduce HERG-blocking potency of neuroleptics. Haloperidol, pimozide, and fluspirilene inhibited HERG current with IC(50) of 1.36, 1.74, and 2.34 microM, and maximal block of 73%, 76% and 65%, respectively. The action of these neuroleptics was voltage-dependent, most consistent with an open-channel blocking mechanism. Pretreatment of HERG-expressing oocytes with 1 microM testosterone increased the IC(50) values to 2.73, 2.08, and 5.04 microM, reduced the maximal block to 65%, 59%, and 64%, and strongly diminished voltage-dependence of the blockade. Testosterone treatment per se produced about a 35% reduction of HERG current compared with untreated oocytes. Our data suggest that androgens may protect against the arrhythmogenic actions of some cardiotoxic drugs.",

    "title": "FPL 66096: a novel, highly potent and selective antagonist at human platelet P2T-purinoceptors.",
    "abstract": "1. ADP-dependent platelet aggregation is mediated by the P2T-purinoceptor and is specifically inhibited by ATP, which is a competitive P2T-purinoceptor antagonist. However, ATP functions as an agonist at other P2-purinoceptor subtypes in other tissues and is, therefore, non-selective. This paper describes the effects of the novel ATP analogue, FPL 66096 (2-propylthio-D-beta,gamma-difluoromethylene ATP), on ADP-induced and ADP-independent aggregation of human washed platelets and in standard preparations containing P2X- (rabbit ear artery) and P2Y-purinoceptors (guinea-pig aorta). 2. In suspensions of human washed platelets, FPL 66096 (1-100 nM) produced concentration-dependent rightward displacement of concentration-effect (E/[A]) curves obtained for ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Logistic fitting of E/[A] data indicated that the effect of FPL 66096 was consistent with simple competition with a pKB value of 8.66. FPL 66096 (10-1000 nM) had no effect on aggregation produced by the thromboxane A2-mimetic, U46619 (0.1-10 microM) when the response to this agent was rendered ADP-independent by inclusion of the non-selective P2-purinoceptor antagonist, suramin (100 microM). 3. The anti-aggregatory potency of FPL 66096 was not influenced by increasing the incubation time from 2 to 15 min nor by inclusion of the P1-purinoceptor antagonist 8-sulphophenyltheophylline at a concentration (300 microM) that produced a 68 fold rightward displacement of the anti-aggregatory E/[A] curve for the P1-purinoceptor agonist, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (0.1-1000 microM). 4. FLP 66096 behaved as a weak (pA\" 3.68) but full P2x-purinoceptor agonist in preparations of the rabbit isolated ear artery and as a weak, competitive antagonist (apparent pKB 4.71) at P2Y purinoceptors in the guinea-pig isolated aorta, indicating a selectivity of at least 9000 fold for the P2t-subtype. In the latter preparation, non-specific relaxations were produced by concentrations of FPL 66096 &gt;10M gM.5. These results indicate that FPL 66096 is a P2-purinoceptor antagonist of unprecedented potency and selectivity and that its effects are consistent with simple competition at the P2-purinoceptor. Therefore,FPL 66096 represents a novel pharmacological tool in the classification of P2-purinoceptors and in the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in activation of platelets by ADP.",

Evidence obtained in isolated circular strips from bovine coronary arteries indicates that SIN-1 increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate in close association with its relaxant effects in coronary strips under various pharmacologic conditions, suggesting that cyclic guanosine monophosphate mediates relaxation. Various nitrovasodilators act by the same mechanism, which is stimulation of guanylate cyclase. In this study the effect of nitroglycerin depended on the presence of a special thiol, cysteine, whereas SIN-1 was active also in the absence of cysteine. Cysteine deficiency was found to be associated with tolerance. After prolonged exposure to the drug, tolerance toward nitroglycerin developed in coronary strips that was antagonized by cysteine. SIN-1 produced no significant tolerance and was also fully active in nitroglycerin-tolerant strips. We conclude that SIN-1 relaxes vascular smooth muscle by direct stimulation of guanylate cyclase, whereas nitroglycerin probably must be converted into a cyclase stimulator by a cysteine-dependent reaction.",

Clinical experience in infectious patients has shown that oral telithromycin 800mg once daily for 5-10 days is effective for the treatment of community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Absorption of telithromycin in humans is estimated to be &gt; or = 90%. Prior to entering the systemic circulation, telithromycin undergoes first-pass metabolism (mainly by the liver). Its absolute bioavailability is 57% and is unaffected by food. The volume of distribution of telithromycin after intravenous infusion is 2.9 L/kg. Telithromycin is 60-70% bound to serum proteins and has extensive diffusion into a range of target biological tissues, achieving concentrations above its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against key respiratory pathogens throughout the dosing interval. After entering the systemic circulation, telithromycin is eliminated by multiple pathways (7% by biliary and/or intestinal excretion, 13% by renal excretion and 37% by hepatic metabolism). Telithromycin is metabolised via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and non-CYP pathways. The identified metabolites show minimal antibacterial activity compared with the parent drug. In healthy subjects receiving telithromycin 800 mg once daily, the peak plasma concentration achieved is 2.27 microg/mL. Plasma concentrations of telithromycin show a biphasic decrease over time, with an initial disposition half-life of 2.9 hours and a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 10 hours after multiple dose administration. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within 2-3 days of once-daily administration. Owing to elimination by multiple pathways there is a small increase in exposure when one of these elimination pathways is impaired, as indicated by the results of studies in special patient populations (e.g. those with hepatic or renal impairment). Dosage reductions may be recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by potent inhibitors such as itraconazole and ketoconazole results in a 54% and 95% increase in telithromycin area under the plasma concentration-time curve, respectively. The potential for telithromycin to inhibit the CYP3A4 pathway is similar to that of clarithromycin. The once-daily administration of telithromycin is likely to limit the potential for drug interactions and clinically significant increases in exposure. In phase III clinical trials, the telithromycin 800 mg once-daily dose has been shown to provide close to the maximum antimicrobial activity against S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. In conclusion, telithromycin has a well characterised and reproducible pharmacokinetic profile, with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships supporting an oral dosage regimen of 800 mg once daily.",

Analogues of 1t (3), which have (S)- and (R)-methyl groups at the benzylic methylene portion of 1t, were prepared and separated into the diastereomeric atropisomers, 3a-A, 3a-B and 3b-A, 3b-B, in enantiomerically pure forms. Among the four isomers of 3, the (aR, S)-enantiomer (3a-A) exhibited the most potent antagonistic activities with an IC50 value of 0.80 nM (in vitro inhibition of [125I]BH-SP binding in human IM-9 cells) and ED50 values of 9.3 micrograms/kg (iv) and 67.7 micrograms/kg (po) (in vivo inhibition of capsaicin-induced plasma extravasation in guinea pig trachea), while the activity of the (aS,R)-enantiomer (3b-B) was the weakest with an IC50 value of 620 nM. The structure-activity relationships in this series of antagonists indicate that the (R)-configuration at the axial bond and the stacking (or stacking-like) conformation between the two phenyl rings as shown in 1t-A and 3a-A are essential for high-affinity binding and suggest that the amide moiety functions as a hydrogen bond acceptor in the interaction with the receptor.",

In this study, the Ang II receptor blockade induced by the recommended starting dose of 3 antagonists was evaluated in normotensive subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 4-way crossover study. At 1-week intervals, 12 subjects received a single dose of losartan (50 mg), valsartan (80 mg), irbesartan (150 mg), or placebo. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system was assessed before and 4, 24, and 30 hours after drug intake by 3 independent methods: inhibition of the blood pressure response to exogenous Ang II, in vitro Ang II receptor assay, and reactive changes in plasma Ang II levels. At 4 hours, losartan blocked 43% of the Ang II-induced systolic blood pressure increase; valsartan, 51%; and irbesartan, 88% (P&lt;0.01 between drugs). The effect of each drug declined with time. At 24 hours, a residual effect was found with all 3 drugs, but at 30 hours, only irbesartan induced a marked, significant blockade versus placebo. Similar results were obtained when Ang II receptor blockade was assessed with an in vitro receptor assay and by the reactive rise in plasma Ang II levels. This study thus demonstrates that the first administration of the recommended starting dose of irbesartan induces a greater and longer lasting Ang II receptor blockade than that of valsartan and losartan in normotensive subjects.",

This has led to testing of tachykinin NK(3) receptor activity in gerbils and guinea pigs. As these species are much less common laboratory animals than rats and mice, there is a relative paucity of in vivo testing models for tachykinin NK(3) receptor activation. In the present study, locomotor activity induced by the tachykinin NK(3) receptor agonist senktide was characterized. Injection of senktide i.c.v. was found to dose-dependently induce hyperlocomotion from a dose of 0.06 nmol to the maximal dose tested, 0.6 nmol. Locomotion induced by 0.1 nmol of senktide could be blocked by injection of the tachykinin NK(3) receptor antagonists SB222200 (10 and 30 mg/kg i.p.) and talnetant (SB223412; 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p.), as well as by osanetant (SR142801; 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p.) when administered in a vehicle containing vitamin E and glycofurol. Senktide-induced activity was also reversed by the antipsychotics haloperidol (0.3 and 1 mg/kg p.o.) and risperidone (1 mg/kg p.o.), but not by the serotonin 5HT(2a/c) receptor antagonist MDL100907 (tested at 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg p.o.). Hyperlocomotion induced by 0.03 nmol of senktide was potentiated by antagonism of the tachykinin NK(1) receptor with aprepitant (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.). Thus, hyperlocomotion induced by senktide in gerbils is a tachykinin NK(3) receptor-mediated behavior that is appropriate for use in testing tachykinin NK(3) receptor activity of novel compounds.",

    "abstract": "In addition to antidepressant drugs, some neuroleptic (NL) drugs reduce serotonin2 (5-HT2) receptor binding sites after chronic administration. The present study was undertaken to characterize further this property of NL drugs. Scatchard analysis of [3H]spiperone binding in rat cerebral cortex revealed that 21-day treatment with chlorpromazine (CPZ), cis-flupenthixol, and thioridazine reduced 5-HT2 radioligand binding density by 60, 27, and 18%, respectively. The more selective dopamine-D2 antagonists haloperidol and sulpiride were totally ineffective in this regard. No reduction in 5-HT2 ligand binding sites occurred after 1 day of treatment with CPZ but 3-days of treatment was effective and this reduction persisted, although diminished, for at least 72 h after the last injection. cis-Flupenthixol and d-butaclamol were also effective after 3 days of treatment but trans-flupenthixol and l-butaclamol were not, indicating stereo-specificity of the response mechanism. Female rats showed the same response to CPZ as did male rats. Central 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-induced lesions of 5-HT neurons demonstrated that intact 5-HT neurons were not required for the reduction of 5-HT2 receptor ligand binding by CPZ. Since CPZ has high affinity for many receptors, including alpha 1, histamine1, and muscarinic receptors, the role of these effects in producing 5-HT2 receptor down-regulation was considered by studying the effects of prazosin, atropine, and pyrilamine administration on 5-HT2 radioligand binding. Results indicate that no one of these actions appears to account for the down-regulation of 5-HT2 receptors by CPZ. Several of these effects, in combination, or some unique mechanism, may be involved.",

    "abstract": "Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter regions is an important mechanism to silence the expression of many important genes in cancer. The hypermethylation status is passed to the daughter cells through the methylation of the newly synthesized DNA strand by 5-cytosine DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). We report herein that (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol from green tea, can inhibit DNMT activity and reactivate methylation-silenced genes in cancer cells. With nuclear extracts as the enzyme source and polydeoxyinosine-deoxycytosine as the substrate, EGCG dose-dependently inhibited DNMT activity, showing competitive inhibition with a K(i) of 6.89 microM. Studies with structural analogues of EGCG suggest the importance of D and B ring structures in the inhibitory activity. Molecular modeling studies also support this conclusion, and suggest that EGCG can form hydrogen bonds with Pro(1223), Glu(1265), Cys(1225), Ser(1229), and Arg(1309) in the catalytic pocket of DNMT. Treatment of human esophageal cancer KYSE 510 cells with 5-50 microM of EGCG for 12-144 h caused a concentration- and time-dependent reversal of hypermethylation of p16(INK4a), retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta), O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT), and human mutL homologue 1 (hMLH1) genes as determined by the appearance of the unmethylation-specific bands in PCR. This was accompanied by the expression of mRNA of these genes as determined by reverse transcription-PCR. The re-expression of RARbeta and hMLH1 proteins by EGCG was demonstrated by Western blot. Reactivation of some methylation-silenced genes by EGCG was also demonstrated in human colon cancer HT-29 cells, esophageal cancer KYSE 150 cells, and prostate cancer PC3 cells. The results demonstrate for the first time the inhibition of DNA methylation by a commonly consumed dietary constituent and suggest the potential use of EGCG for the prevention or reversal of related gene-silencing in the prevention of carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The vasopressin (AVP) V3 pituitary receptor (V3R) is a G protein-coupled corticotropic phenotypic marker that is overexpressed in ACTH-hypersecreting tumors. Studies of the agonist/antagonist binding profile and signal transduction pathways linked to the human V3R have been limited because of the scarcity of this protein. To define the signals activated by V3Rs and the eventual changes triggered by developmental or pathological receptor regulation, we developed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-V3 cells stably expressing low, medium, or high levels of human V3Rs (binding capacity, &lt;10, 10-25, and 25-100 pmol/mg, respectively). The affinity of the V3R for 21 peptide and nonpeptide AVP analogs was clearly distinct from that exhibited by the human V1R and V2R. AVP triggered stimulation of phospholipase C in CHO-V3 cells (partially sensitive to treatment with pertussis toxin) with a potency directly proportional to receptor density. V3R-mediated arachidonic acid release also was also sensitive to pertussis toxin and more efficacious in cells exhibiting medium than in those with high receptor density. AVP also stimulated the pertussis toxin-insensitive uptake of [3H]thymidine in CHO-V3 cells. The concentration-response curves for this effect were monophasic in cells expressing low and medium levels of V3Rs; on the contrary, a biphasic curve was observed in cells with high V3R density. Coupling of V3R to increased production of cAMP was only observed in CHOV3 high cells, suggesting a negative relationship between increased cAMP production and DNA synthesis. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by V3R was pertussis toxin insensitive, but was dependent on activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C; both the level and duration of activation were a function of the receptor density. Thus, the human V3R has a pharmacological profile clearly distinct from that of the human V1R and V2R and activates several signaling pathways via different G proteins, depending on the level of receptor expression. The increased synthesis of DNA and cAMP levels observed in cells expressing medium and high levels of V3Rs, respectively, may represent important events in the tumorigenesis of corticotroph cells.",

More than 65 PH1-related mutations are now documented in the AGT gene (AGXT), of which about 50% are missense. We have generated a spectrum of 15 missense changes including the most common PH1 mutation, G170R, and expressed them on the appropriate background of the major or minor allele, in an Escherichia coli overexpression system and in a rabbit reticulocyte transcription/translation system. We have investigated their effects on enzyme activity, dimerization, aggregation, and turnover. The effect of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) on dimerization and stability was also investigated. Although all 15 mutant AGTs were expressed as intact proteins in E. coli, only three: G41R and G41V on the major allele, and the common mutation G170R, resulted in significant amounts of enzymatic activity. Dimerization failure was a frequent observation (13/15) except for G41V and D183N. Dimerization was poor with S187F but was substantially improved with PLP. Proteasome-mediated protein degradation was observed for all the mutations except G41R on the major allele, G41V, D183N, G170R, and S218L. Increases in the stability of the mutant enzymes in the presence of PLP were small; however, G41R on the minor allele showed a direct relationship between its half life and the concentration of PLP. The minor allele AGT product and many of the mutants were subject to a limited non-proteasomal proteolytic cleavage when ATP was depleted.",

The study assessed CKD-516 as a vascular disrupting agent or anti-cancer drug. METHODS: To assess the effect of S516 on vascularization, we analyzed the effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). To determine the inhibition of cell proliferation of S516, we used H460 lung carcinoma cells. The alteration of microtubules was analyzed using immunoblot, RT-PCR and confocal imaging. To evaluate the anti-tumor effects of gemcitabine and/or CKD-516, H460 xenograft mice were treated with CKD-516 (2.5 mg/kg) and/or gemcitabine (40 mg/kg), and tumor growth was compared with vehicle-treated control. For histologic analysis, liver, spleen and tumor tissues from H460 xenograft mice were obtained 12 and 24 h after CKD-516 injection. RESULTS: Cytoskeletal changes of HUVECs treated with 10 nM S516 were assessed by immunoblot and confocal imaging. S516 disrupted tubulin assembly and resulted in microtubule dysfunction, which induced cell cycle arrest (G2/M). S516 markedly enhanced the depolymerization of microtubules, perhaps due to the vascular disrupting properties of S516. Interestingly, S516 decreased the amount of total tubulin protein in HUVECs. Especially, S516 decreased mRNA expression alpha-tubulin (HUVECs only) and beta-tubulin (HUVECs and H460 cells) at an early time point (4 h). Immunocytochemical analysis showed that S516 changed the cellular microtubule network and inhibited the formation of polymerized microtubules. Extensive central necrosis of tumors was evident by 12 h after treatment with CKD-516 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.). In H460 xenografts, CKD-516 combined with gemcitabine significantly delayed tumor growth up to 57 % and 36 % as compared to control and gemcitabine alone, respectively. CONCLUSION: CKD-516 is a novel agent with vascular disrupting properties and enhances anti-tumor activity in combination with chemotherapy.",

Several of them interact with acetylated lysine residues, leading to the recruitment and stabilization of protein complexes.

The recent identification of inhibitors of BET and non-BET bromodomains is one of the few examples in which effective blockade of a protein-protein interaction can be achieved with a small molecule. This has led to major strides in the understanding of the function of bromodomain-containing proteins and their involvement in diseases such as cancer and inflammation. Indeed, BET bromodomain inhibitors are now being clinically evaluated for the treatment of hematological tumors and have also been tested in clinical trials for the relatively rare BRD-NUT midline carcinoma.

METHODS: Nasal challenges were carried out with the TRPV1-activators capsaicin, anandamide and olvanil. Moreover, challenges were performed with mustard oil (allylisothiocyanate) and cinnamaldehyde as well as menthol, activators of TRPA1 and TRPM8, respectively.

RESULTS: The TRPV1, TRPA1 and TRPM8-activators produced sensory symptoms dominated by pain and smart. During seasonal allergen exposure, but not prior to season, TRPV1-activators also induced itch. Furthermore, the seasonal challenge to the TRPV1-activator olvanil was associated with rhinorrhoea.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To provide a rational basis for recommended daily allowances (RDA) of dietary phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and menaquinone (vitamin K2) intake that adequately supply extrahepatic (notably vascular) tissue requirements. BACKGROUND: Vitamin K has a key function in the synthesis of at least two proteins involved in calcium and bone metabolism, namely osteocalcin and matrix Gla-protein (MGP). MGP was shown to be a strong inhibitor of vascular calcification. Present RDA values for vitamin K are based on the hepatic phylloquinone requirement for coagulation factor synthesis. Accumulating data suggest that extrahepatic tissues such as bone and vessel wall require higher dietary intakes and have a preference for menaquinone rather than for phylloquinone. METHODS: Tissue-specific vitamin K consumption under controlled intake was determined in warfarin-treated rats using the vitamin K-quinone/epoxide ratio as a measure for vitamin K consumption. Immunohistochemical analysis of human vascular material was performed using a monoclonal antibody against MGP. The same antibody was used for quantification of MGP levels in serum. RESULTS: At least some extrahepatic tissues including the arterial vessel wall have a high preference for accumulating and using menaquinone rather than phylloquinone. Both intima and media sclerosis are associated with high tissue concentrations of MGP, with the most prominent accumulation at the interface between vascular tissue and calcified material. This was consistent with increased concentrations of circulating MGP in subjects with atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating the association between MGP and vascular calcification. The hypothesis is put forward that undercarboxylation of MGP is a risk factor for vascular calcification and that the present RDA values are too low to ensure full carboxylation of MGP.",

The nonselective PDE inhibitors, caffeine and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and the type IV-selective PDE inhibitors, rolipram and Ro 20-1724, had pronounced respiratory-stimulant effects during conditions of normocapnia and hypercapnia, and their potencies in increasing ventilation corresponded with their potencies as PDE inhibitors.

CGS 15943, a selective adenosine antagonist lacking PDE-inhibitory effects, also had only modest respiratory-stimulant effects at the highest dose studied. In contrast to their relative potencies and efficacies in stimulating respiration, caffeine and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were less efficacious than CGS 15943 in increasing fixed-interval responding, and CI-930, rolipram and Ro 20-1724 only decreased fixed-interval responding. Zaprinast had little or no behavioral effect. The results support the interpretation that inhibition of type IV PDE plays a prominent role in the respiratory-stimulant effects of xanthines, whereas the behavioral-stimulant effects are more closely related to antagonism of adenosine receptors.",

    "title": "Identification of indole derivatives exclusively interfering with a G protein-independent signaling pathway of the prostaglandin D2 receptor CRTH2.",
    "abstract": "The anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and ramatroban, the latter showing clinical efficacy in treating allergic asthma, have been shown to act as a classic agonist and antagonist, respectively, of the G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2 receptor). Here, we report the identification of two indole derivatives 1-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-5-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-carboxylic acid and N(alpha)-tosyltryptophan (hereafter referred to as 1 and 2, respectively), which are structurally related to indomethacin and ramatroban but which selectively interfere with a specific G protein-independent signaling pathway of CRTH2. In whole-cell saturation-binding assays, 1 and 2 both increase the number of [(3)H]prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)-recognizing CRTH2 sites and the affinity of PGD2 for CRTH2. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays show that they do not alter the total number of CRTH2 receptors on the cell surface. Analysis of their binding mode indicates that unlike indomethacin or ramatroban, 1 and 2 can occupy CRTH2 simultaneously with PGD2. On a functional level, however, 1 and 2 do not interfere with PGD2-mediated activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by CRTH2. In contrast, both compounds inhibit PGD2-mediated arrestin translocation via a G protein-independent mechanism. In human eosinophils endogenously expressing CRTH2, 1 selectively decreases the efficacy but not the potency of PGD2-induced shape change, unlike ramatroban, which displays competitive antagonistic behavior. These data show for the first time that \"antagonists\" can cause markedly dissimilar degrees of inhibition for different effector pathways and suggest that it may be possible to develop novel classes of specific signal-inhibiting drugs distinct from conventional antagonists.",

    "abstract": "For several years, our laboratory has investigated the role for the HPA axis in cocaine reinforcement. Two classes of drugs that we have studied include corticosterone synthesis inhibitors (e.g., metyrapone) and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g., oxazepam). In the experiments described in this manuscript, we tested the effects of various doses of metyrapone and oxazepam against several doses of self-administered cocaine. Behavioral, endocrine and pharmacokinetic measures of the effects of the combination of metyrapone and oxazepam on cocaine reward are presented. Combinations of metyrapone and oxazepam at doses that produced no observable effects when administered separately significantly reduced cocaine self-administration without affecting food-maintained responding during the same sessions. Changes in pharmacokinetics or endocrine function do not appear to mediate these effects, suggesting a central mechanism of action. Therefore, although these drugs produce their effects through distinct mechanisms, an additive effect on cocaine self-administration is obtained when these drugs are administered together, suggesting that combinations of low doses of metyrapone and oxazepam may be useful in reducing cocaine seeking with a reduced incidence of unwanted side effects and a decreased potential for abuse.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we reported that the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor, but not the alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor, mediates pupillary dilation elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation in rats. This study was undertaken to further characterize the alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating pupillary dilation in response to both neural and agonist activation. Pupillary dilator response curves were generated by intravenous injection of norepinephrine in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Involvement of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors was established as mydriatic responses were inhibited by systemic administration of nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, phentolamine (0.3-3 mg/kg) and phenoxybenzamine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), as well as by the selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.3 mg/kg). The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine (0.5 mg/kg), was without antagonistic effects. alpha(1A)-Adrenoceptor selective antagonists, 2-([2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl]aminomethyl)-1,4-benzodioxane (WB-4101; 0.1-1 mg/kg) and 5-methylurapidil (0.1-1 mg/kg), the alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor selective antagonist, 4-amino-2-[4-[1-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-2(S)- [[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]carbonyl]-piperazinyl]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (L-765314; 0.3-1 mg/kg), as well as the alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor selective antagonist, 8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione (BMY-7378; 1 mg/kg), were used to delineate the adrenoceptor subtypes involved. Mydriatic responses to norepinephrine were significantly antagonized by intravenous administration of both WB-4101 and 5-methylurapidil, but neither by L-765314 nor by BMY-7378. L-765314 (0.3-3 mg/kg, i.v.) was also ineffective in inhibiting the mydriasis evoked by cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation. These results suggest that alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors do not mediate sympathetic mydriasis in rats, and that the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor is the exclusive subtype mediating mydriatic responses in this species.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian cells, factor VIII (FVIII) secretion depends upon its interaction with chaperones of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and requires a unique ATP-dependent step to dissociate aggregates formed within the ER. To further elucidate mechanisms which might account for the inefficient secretion of recombinant FVIII (rFVIII), we have analyzed the pathways of recombinant full length (rFVIII-FL) and B-domain deleted (rFVIII Delta B) FVIII and compared these to the secretion route of native FVIII in primary hepatocytes. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy in combination with a pulse chase of a known secretion marker, we describe the trafficking route of FVIII, which upon release from the ER--where it colocalizes with calnexin--is transported to the Golgi complex in vesicular-tubular transport complexes (VTCs) which could be further identified as being COP I coated. However, a large portion of rFVIII is retained in the ER and additionally in structures which could not be assigned to the ER, Golgi complex or intermediate compartment. Moderate BiP transcription levels indicate that this observed retention of FVIII does not reflect cellular stress due to an overexpression of FVIII-protein in transduced cells. Moreover, a pulse of newly synthesized rFVIII protein is released within 4 hrs, indicating that once rFVIII is released from the ER there is no further limitation to its secretion. Our data provide new details about the secretory route of FVIII, which may ultimately help to identify factors currently limiting the efficient and physiological expression of FVIII in gene therapy and manufacture.",

AREAS COVERED: Efficacy and tolerability of treatment regimens containing the non-nucleoside analog polymerase inhibitor dasabuvir (ABT-333). EXPERT OPINION: Dasabuvir-containing regimens achieve high rates of sustained virologic response in HCV genotype 1a and 1b-infected patients when combined with other DAAs, namely paritaprevir (ABT-450), ritonavir and ombitasvir (ABT-267). In the populations studied, dasabuvir seems to be well tolerated and safe. The major limitations of this novel drug are its genotype-restricted activity, the necessity to include ribavirin for HCV genotype 1a and the emergence of resistance if not combined with other DDAs.",

In intact chick retina, agmatine 1 mM decreases dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP)-induced depolarizations measured in the optic nerve by approximately 70%, while having little effect on responses induced by glutamate analogues. DMPP dose-response curves are reduced in a manner consistent with a non-competitive effect of agmatine, and agmatine at 1 mM does not prevent binding of 125I-labelled neuronal bungarotoxin, a snake venom neurotoxin that competitively binds and blocks functional nicotinic receptors in chick retinal homogenates. 3. Agmatine (10 mM) substantially blocks both DMPP-induced depolarizations of rat superior cervical ganglion and synaptic transmission through the ganglion. Others have established that [3H]-agmatine will pass through nicotinic receptor channels in the rat ganglion.

    "abstract": "Environmental substances seem to be involved in the etiology of breast cancers. Many studies have found an association between human cancer and exposure to agricultural pesticides such as the organophosphorous pesticides. Parathion is a cholinesterase inhibitor that induces the hydrolysis of body choline esters, including acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The primary target of action in insects is the nervous system whereby pesticides inhibit the release of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase at the synaptic junction. Atropine is a parasympatholytic alkaloid used as an antidote to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of parathion and atropine on cell transformation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro. These studies showed that parathion alone was able to induce malignant transformation of an immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10F as indicated by increased cell proliferation, anchorage independency and invasive capabilities. There was also an increase in c-kit, Trio, Rho-A, Rac-3, EGFR, Notch-4, Dvl-2, Ezrin, beta catenin and mutant p53 protein expression in the parathion-treated cells. However, atropine significantly inhibited this increase. In a human cell cycle array of 96 genes, 13 of them were altered by parathion treatment. Among the genes affected were the cyclins, such as cyclin D3, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) such as CDK41 and the minichromosome maintenance deficient (MCM) MCM2 and MCM3. It is suggested that parathion influences human breast epithelial cell transformation and is an initiator factor in the transformation process in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that overproduction of prostanoids attributable to overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an important role in colon carcinogenesis. We have shown recently that the prostaglandin (PG) E receptor, EP(1), but not EP(3), is involved in mouse colon carcinogenesis. In line with our previous study, here we examined the role of prostanoid receptors in colon carcinogenesis using six additional lines of knockout mice deficient in prostanoid receptors EP(2), EP(4), DP, FP, IP, or TP. The animals were treated with the colon carcinogen, azoxymethane (AOM), and examined for the development of aberrant crypt foci (ACFs), putative preneoplastic lesions in the colon. Formation of ACFs was decreased only in the EP(4)-knockout mice, to 56% of the wild-type level. To confirm these results, we also examined the inhibitory effects of an EP(4)-selective antagonist, ONO-AE2-227, in the diet on the formation of AOM-induced colon ACFs in C57BL/6Cr mice and on the development of intestinal polyps in Min mice. ONO-AE2-227 at a dose of 400 ppm reduced the formation of ACFs to 67% of the control level, and intestinal polyp numbers in Min mice receiving 300 ppm were decreased to 69% of the control level. Plating efficiency assays showed that addition of 1.0 microM ONO-AE1-329, an EP(4)-selective agonist, resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in the colony number of the human colon cancer cell line, HCA-7, similar to the effect of PGE(2). Moreover, EP(4) mRNA expression was clearly observed in normal colon mucosa and colon tumors in mice. Our previous and present results indicate that PGE(2) contributes to colon carcinogenesis through its actions mediated through EP(1) and EP(4) receptors; therefore, antagonists for these two receptors may be good candidates as chemopreventive agents against colon cancer.",

The drugs effective in obesity treatment may act by different mechanisms such as reduction in food intake, inhibition of fat absorption, increase of thermogenesis and stimulation of adipocyte apoptosis. At present, we only have two marketed drugs for obesity treatment. Sibutramine is an inhibitor of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonina reuptake which inhibits food intake and increases thermogenesis. Sibutramine administration for a year can induce a weight loss of 4-7%. Its main side effects are hypertension, headache, insomnia and constipation. Orlistat is an inhibitor of pancreatic lipase which is able to block the absorption of 30% of ingested fat. Its administration induces weight loss and reduction of ulterior weight regain. Also, this drug improves hypertension dyslipdaemia and helps to prevent diabetes in 52% of cases when administered over four years. The increase in frequency of stools and interference with vitamin absorption are its main side effects. Glucagon-like peptide 1, which increases insulin sensitivity and satiety, adiponectin and PPAR-gamma agonists which reduce insulin resistance and modulates adipocyte generation are the basis for future therapeutic approaches of obesity. Phosphatase inhibitors induce PPAR-gamma phosphorylation and UCP-1 expression leading to an increase in thermogenesis and reduction in appetite.",

    "abstract": "Bupropion (2a) analogues were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit monoamine uptake and to antagonize the effects of human alpha3beta4*, alpha4beta2, alpha4beta4, and alpha1* nAChRs. The analogues were evaluated for their ability to block nicotine-induced effects in four tests in mice. Nine analogues showed increased monoamine uptake inhibition. Similar to 2a, all but one analogue show inhibition of nAChR function selective for human alpha3beta4*-nAChR. Nine analogues have higher affinity at alpha3beta4*-nAChRs than 2a. Four analogues also had higher affinity for alpha4beta2 nAChR. Analogues 2r, 2m, and 2n with AD(50) values of 0.014, 0.015, and 0.028 mg/kg were 87, 81, and 43 times more potent than 2a in blocking nicotine-induced antinociception in the tail-flick test. Analogue 2x with IC(50) values of 31 and 180 nM for DA and NE, respectively, and with IC(50) of 0.62 and 9.8 microm for antagonism of alpha3beta4 and alpha4beta2 nAChRs had the best overall in vitro profile relative to 2a.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin spindle protein (KSP), an ATPase responsible for spindle pole separation during mitosis that is present only in proliferating cells, has become a novel and attractive anticancer target with potential for reduced side effects compared to currently available therapies. We report herein the discovery of the first known ATP-competitive inhibitors of KSP, which display a unique activity profile as compared to the known loop 5 (L5) allosteric KSP inhibitors that are currently under clinical evaluation. Optimization of this series led to the identification of biphenyl sulfamide 20, a potent KSP inhibitor with in vitro antiproliferative activity against human cells with either wild-type KSP (HCT116) or mutant KSP (HCT116 D130V). In a murine xenograft model with HCT116 D130V tumors, 20 showed significant antitumor activity following intraperitoneal dosing, providing in vivo proof-of-principle of the efficacy of an ATP-competitive KSP inhibitor versus tumors that are resistant to the other known KSP inhibitors.",

The binding of [3H]ACh to endothelial membranes was displacable by nanomolar concentrations of scopolamine but only by micromolar concentrations of atropine and homatropine. The reverse was true for smooth muscle membranes, i.e. [3H]ACh binding was displacable by nanomolar concentrations of atropine and homatropine but only by micromolar concentrations of scopolamine. Pirenzepine, AF-DX 116 and 4-diphenyl-acetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP) displaced the binding of [3H]ACh from both tissues in the nano- to micromolar range. Our findings indicate that endothelial receptors are characterised by a high affinity for scopolamine, which possesses a scopine base, and that muscle binding sites have a high affinity for antagonists possessing a tropine base (atropine, homatropine). Both the endothelial and smooth muscle binding sites have a low affinity for AF-DX 116, indicating that they are not of the cardiac type.",

    "title": "Polyamines, androgens, and skeletal muscle hypertrophy.",
    "abstract": "The naturally occurring polyamines, spermidine, spermine, and their precursor putrescine, play indispensible roles in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, from basic DNA synthesis to regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The rate-limiting polyamine biosynthetic enzymes, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, are essential for mammalian development, with knockout of the genes encoding these enzymes, Odc1 and Amd1, causing early embryonic lethality in mice. In muscle, the involvement of polyamines in muscle hypertrophy is suggested by the concomitant increase in cardiac and skeletal muscle mass and polyamine levels in response to anabolic agents including beta-agonists. In addition to beta-agonists, androgens, which increase skeletal mass and strength, have also been shown to stimulate polyamine accumulation in a number of tissues. In muscle, androgens act via the androgen receptor to regulate expression of polyamine biosynthetic enzyme genes, including Odc1 and Amd1, which may be one mechanism via which androgens promote muscle growth. This review outlines the role of polyamines in proliferation and hypertrophy, and explores their possible actions in mediating the anabolic actions of androgens in muscle.",

    "abstract": "Three series of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibiting the cyclooxygenase/5-lipoxygenase (COX/5-LOX) pathways as such as formation of hydroxyl radicals and adhesion were prepared: 4,5-diaryl isothiazoles, 4,5-diaryl 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thiones and 4,5-diaryl 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-ones. The aim of the present study was to develop substances which can intervene into the inflammatory processes via different mechanisms of action as multiple target non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (MTNSAIDs) with increased anti-inflammatory potential. The current lead 11a was evaluated in COX-1/2, 5-LOX and (*)OH scavenging in vitro assays and in a static adhesion assay where it proved to inhibit adhesion. Moreover, 11a treatment attenuated expression of macrophage adhesion molecule-1 (Mac-1) on extravasated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) which indicates that the activation was reduced. The assays used are predictive for the in vivo efficacy of test compounds as shown for 11a in a peritonitis model of acute inflammation in mice. Thus, the novel 5-LOX/COX and (*)OH inhibitor 11a possesses anti-inflammatory activity that, in addition to COX/5-LOX inhibition, implicates effects on leukocyte-endothelial interactions.",

G6PDH catalyzes the first step of the pentose-phosphate pathway supplying cells with ribose 5-phosphate, a precursor of nucleic acid synthesis, and NADPH for biosynthetic processes and protection against oxidative stress. In this paper we demonstrate that also G6PDH of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is uncompetitively inhibited by DHEA and epiandrosterone (EA), with K(i) values in the lower micromolar range. A viability assay confirmed the toxic effect of both steroids on cultured T. brucei bloodstream form cells. Additionally, RNAi mediated reduction of the G6PDH level in T. brucei bloodstream forms validated this enzyme as a drug target against Human African Trypanosomiasis. Together these findings show that inhibition of G6PDH by DHEA derivatives may lead to the development of a new class of anti-trypanosomatid compounds.",

We evaluated the role of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in determining the sensitivity of leukemia cells to PTL-induced apoptosis. In this study, the level of PTL-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis was significantly higher in the MPO-high leukemia cell lines compared with the MPO-low leukemia cell lines. Pretreatment of MPO-high leukemia cells with a MPO-specific inhibitor, 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide, or a MPO-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated the PTL-induced ROS generation and apoptosis, indicating that MPO plays a crucial role in PTL-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. PTL-induced apoptosis was accompanied by down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, and survivin and selectively observed in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells expressing higher levels of MPO (&gt;=50%) while sparing both AML cells with lower MPO and normal CD34-positive (CD34+) normal bone marrow cells. The extent of PTL-induced apoptosis of the CD34+CD38- cell fraction was significantly greater in the MPO-high AML cases, compared with the MPO-low AML (P &lt; 0.01) and normal CD34+ marrow cells (P &lt; 0.01). Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient human leukemia mouse model also revealed that PTL preferentially targets the MPO-high AML cells. Our data suggest that MPO plays a crucial role in determining the susceptibility of leukemia cells to PTL-induced apoptosis. PTL can be considered a promising leukemic stem cell-targeted therapy for AML expressing high levels of MPO.",

The natural history of the disease often leads to respiratory failure and death, with a mortality rate greater than some cancers. To date, no management approach has proven to be efficacious for the treatment of this disease. IPF has been characterised as an 'epithelial-fibroblastic disorder', characterised by abnormal wound healing with excessive fibrosis and minimal inflammation. These emerging data have focused attention on antifibrotic drugs. Interferon-gamma1b (IFN-gamma1b) has recently been proposed as a promising candidate for the treatment of IPF. The reason for this is that IFN-gamma1b has the ability to modulate the Th1/Th2 imbalance and to suppress fibroblast activation. The view that IPF is untreatable at present requires reconsideration, as improved survival has been suggested in three controlled trials of IFN-gamma1b in IPF therapy.",

    "abstract": "Polyamines are required for cell growth and cell division in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. In the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, biosynthesis of the commonly occurring polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) is dependent on the activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, EC 4.1.1.17) catalyzing the formation of putrescine, which is the precursor of the other two polyamines. In synchronized C. reinhardtii cultures, transition to the cell division phase was preceded by a 4-fold increase in ODC activity and a 10- and a 20-fold increase, respectively, in the putrescine and spermidine levels. Spermine, however, could not be detected in C. reinhardtii cells. Exogenous polyamines caused a decrease in ODC activity. Addition of spermine, but not of spermidine or putrescine, abolished the transition to the cell division phase when applied 7 to 8 h after beginning of the light (growth) phase. Most of the cells had already doubled their cell mass after this growth period. The spermine-induced cell cycle arrest could be overcome by subsequent addition of spermidine or putrescine. The conclusion that spermine affects cell division via a decreased spermidine level was corroborated by the findings that spermine caused a decrease in the putrescine and spermidine levels and that cell divisions also could be prevented by inhibitors of S-adenosyl-methionine decarboxylase and spermidine synthase, respectively, added 8 h after beginning of the growth period. Because protein synthesis was not decreased by addition of spermine under our experimental conditions, we conclude that spermidine affects the transition to the cell division phase directly rather than via protein biosynthesis.",

The melanocortins (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), beta-MSH and gamma-MSH) are agonist peptide ligands for the melanocortin receptors and these peptides are processed from the pre-prohormone proopiomelanocortin (POMC).

We measured ammonium import during the incubation of RBC in a solution containing a radiolabelled analogue of NH4Cl (14C-methyl-NH3Cl). Rhnull cells of the regulator type (expressing no Rh complex proteins) accumulated significantly higher levels (P = 0.05) of radiolabelled methyl-ammonium ions than normal RBC, at room temperature. Rhnull cells of the amorph type (expressing limited amounts of Rh complex proteins) accumulated an intermediate amount of methyl-ammonium ions. To show that decreased ammonium export contributes to its accumulation, the release of intracellular methyl-ammonium from the cells was measured over time. In 30 s, normal RBC released 87% of the intracellular methyl-ammonium ions, whereas Rhnull cells of the regulator type released only 46%.

It is an authentic inhibitor of HIV-1 integration, since treatment of infected cells results in an elevation of two-long terminal repeat circles and a decrease of integration junctions. GS-9160 has potent and selective antiviral activity in primary human T lymphocytes producing a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of approximately 2 nM, with a selectivity index (50% cytotoxic concentration/EC(50)) of approximately 2,000. The antiviral potency of GS-9160 decreased by 6- to 10-fold in the presence of human serum. The antiviral activity of GS-9160 is synergistic in combination with representatives from three different classes of antiviral drugs, namely HIV-1 protease inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Viral resistance selections performed with GS-9160 yielded a novel pattern of mutations within the catalytic core domain of IN; E92V emerged initially, followed by L74M. While E92V as a single mutant conferred 12-fold resistance against GS-9160, L74M had no effect as a single mutant. Together, these mutations conferred 67-fold resistance to GS-9160, indicating that L74M may potentiate the resistance caused by E92V. The pharmacokinetic profile of GS-9160 in healthy human volunteers revealed that once-daily dosing was not likely to achieve antiviral efficacy; hence, the clinical development of this compound was discontinued.",

    "abstract": "Tiazofurin and ribavirin are clinically used inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase (DH), binding to the NAD and IMP sites, respectively, of the target enzyme. In patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis, daily tiazofurin infusions decreased the high IMP DH activity in blast cells and resulted in 77% response (G. Weber. In: R. A. Harkness et al., Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism in Man, Vol. VII, Part B, pp. 287-292, 1991). However, patients relapsed in a few weeks with emergence of high IMP DH activity (G. Tricot et al., Int. J. Cell Cloning, 8: 161-170, 1990). The present study showed that the tiazofurin-induced depression of IMP DH activity in rat bone marrow can be maintained by ribavirin injection. Tiazofurin (150 mg/kg, i.p., once a day for 2 days) decreased IMP DH activity to 10% and ribavirin (250 mg/kg, i.p., once a day for the subsequent 3 days) maintained the enzymic activity at 20 to 30% of control values. In control rats where no ribavirin was given, IMP DH activity of the tiazofurin-treated rats rapidly returned to the range of untreated animals. The decrease of IMP DH activity (t1/2 = 2.6 h) sharply preceded that of the bone marrow cellularity (t1/2 = 17.4 h). In addition to the target enzyme, IMP DH, tiazofurin also decreased activities of the guanylate metabolic enzymes, guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and GMP reductase, and the pyrimidine salvage enzymes, deoxycytidine and thymidine kinases with t1/2 of 2.6, 4.7, 6.0, 3.4, and 6.5 h, respectively. In cycloheximide-treated rats, where much of protein biosynthesis was blocked, the t1/2(8) of these five enzymes in bone marrow were shorter, 1.6, 4.3, 3.0, 0.6, and 0.8 h, respectively. Thus, the impact of tiazofurin in the bone marrow entails a decrease in the activity of the target enzyme, IMP DH, and also of other enzymes in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis as a result of the enzyme half-lives shortened by this drug. These novel observations should assist in achieving better protection and recovery of bone marrow during and after chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The hallmark characteristics of cancer include an unrestrained proliferation involving activation of growth signals, loss of negative regulation and dysfunctional apoptotic pathways. Targeting abnormal cell signalling pathways should provide a more selective approach to cancer treatment than conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Tyrosine kinases play an essential role in the signalling pathways involved in the control of cellular proliferation and growth. Imatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the ABL fusion gene, platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) and KIT. This agent has demonstrated considerable activity in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) by inhibiting the BCR-ABL fusion protein and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), which are predominantly driven by activating mutations in KIT. A number of other rare conditions are also responsive, for example, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, which is driven by a chromosomal translocation involving PDGF-B and Col1A1, resulting in overexpression of PDGF-B, and hypereosinophillic syndrome, which can be caused by activating PDGFR mutations. The pivotal registration study for newly diagnosed CML was a large randomised trial comparing 400 mg/day of imatinib to a combination of IFN-alpha and cytarabine, which demonstrated a significantly higher complete haematological and cytogenetic response rate in the imatinib arm. In the case of GIST a randomised study in patients with inoperable or metastatic disease explored doses of 400 - 600mg and reported a response rate of &gt; 50% in each arm plus disease stabilisation and an improvement in performance status. Large randomised trials have subsequently been performed, comparing 400 with 800mg/day. The first to report indicates that the larger dose is associated with improved progression-free survival, although it is not yet known whether or not this will translate into a difference in overall survival. The most common KIT mutation involves exon 11 and is associated with a statistically significant better response and prognosis compared with other mutations or no detectable mutations. Mutational analysis is likely to become increasingly important in the selection of patients for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment and in helping to understand the nature of acquired resistance.",

Furthermore, the suppression of the immediate-phase asthmatic response and the late-phase asthmatic response by TEI-9874 was almost completely extinguished by the exogenous administration of rat anti-ovalbumin antiserum. These results indicate that the efficacy of TEI-9874 on the asthmatic response is mainly mediated by the suppression of allergen-specific IgE production and TEI-9874 appears to be a good candidate as therapy for IgE-mediated allergic asthma.",

    "title": "In vivo blockade of platelet ADP receptor P2Y12 reduces embolus and thrombus formation but not thrombus stability.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: ADP is a key platelet agonist in thromboembolism. One of the receptors involved in ADP-induced platelet activation is the P2Y12 receptor, which is a target for antithrombotic drugs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we present first evidence for a differential role of this receptor in thrombus and embolus formation in vivo. Anesthetized rabbits were treated with the selective P2Y12 antagonists AR-C69931 MX (3 microg x kg x min(-1) IV) or clopidogrel (25 mg/kg orally). Efficacy of these treatments was monitored by aggregation and thrombin generation measurements in blood samples ex vivo. Mesenteric arterioles were mechanically injured; thrombus growth and subsequent embolus formation were visualized by real-time intravital microscopy. AR-C69931 MX and clopidogrel significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced the total duration of embolization (by 52% and 36%, respectively), and fewer and smaller emboli were produced. The size of the initial thrombus was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.005), but its stability was unaffected: plug formation was still effective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that ADP and its P2Y12 receptor are involved in thrombus growth and especially in the formation of emboli on the downstream side of the initial thrombus. This may explain the beneficial effects of P2Y12 receptor antagonists in secondary prevention of ischemic events in patients with arterial thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: First-trimester abortions especially cervical dilation and suction aspiration are associated with pain despite various methods of pain control. STUDY DESIGN: Following the guidelines for a Cochrane review, we systematically searched for and reviewed randomized controlled trials comparing methods of pain control in first-trimester surgical abortion at less than 14 weeks gestational age using electric or manual suction aspiration. Outcomes included intra- and postoperative pain, side effects, recovery measures and satisfaction. RESULTS: We included 40 trials with 5131 participants. Because of heterogeneity, we divided studies into seven groups: Local anesthesia: Data were insufficient to show a clear benefit of a paracervical block (PCB) compared to no PCB. Reported mean pain scores (10-point scale) during dilation and aspiration were improved with carbonated lidocaine [weighted mean difference (WMD), -0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.89 to -0.71; WMD, -0.96; 95% CI, -1.67 to -0.25], deep injection (WMD, -1.64; 95% CI, -3.21 to -0.08; WMD, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.09 to 0.91), and with adding a 4% intrauterine lidocaine infusion (WMD, -2.0; 95% CI, -3.29 to -0.71; WMD, -2.8; 95% CI, -3.95 to -1.65). PCB with premedication: Ibuprofen and naproxen resulted in small reduction of intra- and postoperative pain. Conscious sedation: The addition of conscious intravenous sedation using diazepam and fentanyl to PCB decreased procedural pain. General anesthesia: Conscious sedation increased intraoperative but decreased postoperative pain compared to general anesthesia (GA) [Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 14.77 (95%, CI 4.91-44.38) and Peto OR 7.47 (95% CI, 2.2-25.36) for dilation and aspiration, respectively, and WMD -1.00 (95% CI, -1.77 to -0.23) postoperatively). Inhalation anesthetics are associated with increased blood loss (p&lt;0.001). GA with premedication: The cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor etoricoxib; the nonselective COX inhibitors lornoxicam, diclofenac and ketorolac IM; and the opioid nalbuphine improved postoperative pain. Nonpharmacological intervention: Listening to music decreased procedural pain. No major complication was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Conscious sedation, GA and some nonpharmacological interventions decreased procedural and postoperative pain, while being safe and satisfactory to patients. Data on the widely used PCB are inadequate to support its use, and it needs to be further studied to determine any benefit.",

(2) ANP and CNP produced concentration-dependent relaxations of mouse aorta that were significantly attenuated by the natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A/B antagonist HS-142-1 (10(-5) M). Both ANP and CNP were more potent in aortae from eNOS KO mice compared to WT. (3) The potency of ANP and CNP in aortae from WT animals was increased in the presence of the NOS inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (3 x 10(-4) M) and the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolol[4,3,a]quinoxalin-1-one (5 x 10(-6) M). (4) In contrast, the potency of ANP and CNP in aortae from eNOS KO animals was reduced following pretreatment of tissues with supramaximal concentrations of the NO-donor, glyceryl trinitrate (3 x 10(-5) M, 30 min) or ANP (10(-7) M, 30 min). (5) Responses to acetylcholine in aortae from WT mice (dependent on the release of endothelium-derived NO) were significantly reduced following pretreatment of tissues with GTN (3 x 10(-5) M, 30 min) and ANP (10(-7) M, 30 min). (6) CNP and the NO-donor, spermine-NONOate caused concentration-dependent relaxations of mesenteric small arteries from WT animals that were significantly increased in eNOS KO mice compared to WT. ANP was unable to significantly relax mesenteric arteries from WT or eNOS KO animals. (7) In conclusion, both NPR-A- and NPR-B-linked pGC pathways are modulated by NO-cGMP in murine aorta and mesenteric small arteries and crossdesensitisation occurs between NPR subtypes. The biological activity of endothelium-derived NO is also influenced by the ambient concentration of NO and natriuretic peptides. Such an autoregulatory pathway may represent an important physiological homeostatic mechanism and link the paracrine activity of NO and CNP with the endocrine functions of ANP and BNP in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure.",

Our study revealed that substitutions in the C7 OH group enhanced the potency toward ALR2, while the C6 OH group interferes with ALR1 inhibition activity. Having the phenyl moiety at C4 leads to improved potency and improved selectivity. A molecular docking study suggested that 6,7-dihydroxy-4-phenylcoumarin (15) binds to ALR2 in a different manner from epalrestat. Furthermore, compound 15 clearly suppressed galactitol accumulation in a dose-dependent manner.

In T cells, ITK is an important mediator for actin reorganization, activation of PLCgamma, mobilization of calcium, and activation of the NFAT transcription factor. ITK plays an important role in the secretion of IL-2, but more critically, also has a pivotal role in the secretion of Th2 cytokines, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. As such, ITK has been shown to regulate the development of effective Th2 response during allergic asthma as well as infections of parasitic worms. This ability of ITK to regulate Th2 responses, along with its pattern of expression, has led to the proposal that it would represent an excellent target for Th2-mediated inflammation. We discuss here the possibilities and pitfalls of targeting ITK for inflammatory disorders.",

All patients were clinically stable and JNJ-39393406 was administered as an adjunct treatment to antipsychotics. No indication was found that JNJ-39393406 has the potential to reverse basic deficits of information processing in schizophrenia (sensory P50 gating) or has a significant effect on other tested electrophysiological markers (MMN, P300 and quantitative resting EEG). Sensitivity analyses including severity of disease, baseline P50 gating, medication and gene variants of the CHRNA7 gene did not reveal any subgroups with consistent significant effects.

    "abstract": "Chronic constipation affects up to 27% of the population and negatively impacts health-related quality-of-life. Prescription medications targeting chronic constipation currently include polyethylene glycol, lactulose and tegaserod, a serotonin type 4 receptor partial agonist. The most recent addition is lubiprostone (Amitiza), a type-2 chloride channel (ClC-2) activator which is a member of a new class of compounds known as prostones. Lubiprostone is a bicyclic fatty acid that acts locally on ClC-2 channels located in the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. This stimulation of chloride secretion induces the passive movement of sodium and water into the intestinal lumen, yielding a net increase in isotonic fluid, which results in improved bowel function. In double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, lubiprostone increased the number of spontaneous bowel movements compared with placebo and was generally well tolerated. The predominant adverse effects were nausea and diarrhea. Lubiprostone represents a new therapeutic class of compounds for the treatment of chronic constipation and will be the focus of this review.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of tuberculosis (TB) is impaired by the long duration and complexity of therapy and the rising incidence of drug resistance. There is an urgent need for new agents with improved efficacy, safety, and compatibility with combination chemotherapies. Oxazolidinones offer a potential new class of TB drugs, and linezolid-the only currently approved oxazolidinone-has proven highly effective against extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB in experimental trials. However, widespread use of linezolid is prohibited by its significant toxicities. AZD5847, a novel oxazolidinone, demonstrates improved in vitro bactericidal activity against both extracellular and intracellular M. tuberculosis compared to that of linezolid. Killing kinetics in broth media and in macrophages indicate that the rate and extent of kill obtained with AZD5847 are superior to those obtained with linezolid. Moreover, the efficacy of AZD5847 was additive when tested along with a variety of conventional TB agents, indicating that AZD5847 may function well in combination therapies. AZD5847 appears to function similarly to linezolid through impairment of the mycobacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. Future studies should be undertaken to further characterize the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of AZD5847 in both in vitro and animal models as well is in human clinical trials.",

In paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients, hemolysis can contribute to thromboembolism (TE), the most feared complication in PNH, and the leading cause of disease-related deaths. We evaluated whether long-term treatment with the complement inhibitor eculizumab reduces the rate of TE in patients with PNH. Clinical trial participants included all patients in the 3 eculizumab PNH clinical studies, which recruited patients between 2002 and 2005 (n = 195); patients from these studies continued treatment in the current multinational open-label extension study. Thromboembolism rate with eculizumab treatment was compared with the pretreatment rate in the same patients. The TE event rate with eculizumab treatment was 1.07 events/100 patient-years compared with 7.37 events/100 patient-years (P &lt; .001) prior to eculizumab treatment (relative reduction, 85%; absolute reduction, 6.3 TE events/100 patient-years). With equalization of the duration of exposure before and during treatment for each patient, TE events were reduced from 39 events before eculizumab to 3 events during eculizumab (P &lt; .001). The TE event rate in antithrombotic-treated patients (n = 103) was reduced from 10.61 to 0.62 events/100 patient-years with eculizumab treatment (P &lt; .001).

    "abstract": "We developed a method for the simultaneous determination of drug affinity constants for rat alpha 2A- and alpha 2B-adrenoceptor subtypes by using [3H]RX821002 radioligand binding in the kidney. Three competition curves were obtained for each drug: one for the test compound in the absence of ARC 239 (a drug found to have 108-fold higher affinity for alpha 2B- than for alpha 2A-adrenoceptors), one in the presence of ARC 239, and one for ARC 239. It is possible to determine the Kds of a tested drug for both alpha 2A- and alpha 2B-adrenoceptors by simultaneous computer modelling because of the increased constraint in the calculations given by the inclusion of ARC 239 into the assay. Using this approach, we found guanfacine and oxymetazoline to be highly alpha 2A-selective. The most alpha 2B-selective were ARC 239, prazosin and corynanthine. A number of other drugs, for example UK-14,304, rilmenidine and clonidine, were non-selective or showed minor selectivity for alpha 2A- or alpha 2B-adrenoceptors. Moreover, using Monte Carlo simulations, we showed that the three-curve method gives more accurate estimates of drug binding constants for assays when two receptor sites are present than methods analysing only one competition curve.",

Although overall mortality appears to be decreasing in recent years due to improvements in supportive care, there are presently no proven, effective pharmacological therapies to treat ARDS and prevent its associated complications. The most common cause of death in ARDS is not hypoxemia or pulmonary failure, but rather multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), suggesting that improving survival in patients with ARDS may be linked to decreasing the incidence or severity of MODS. The key to developing novel treatments depends, in part, on identifying and understanding the mechanisms by which ARDS leads to MODS, although the heterogeneity and complexity of this disorder certainly poses a challenge to investigators. Novel therapies in development for treatment of ALI/ARDS include exogenous surfactant, therapies aimed at modulating neutrophil activity, such as prostaglandin and complement inhibitors, and treatments targeting earlier resolution of ARDS, such as beta-agonists and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. From a clinical perspective, identifying subpopulations of patients most likely to benefit from a particular therapy and recognising the appropriate stage of illness in which to initiate treatment could potentially lead to better outcomes in the short term.",

However, NE-100 does not inhibit dopamine agonist-induced behaviors nor induces catalepsy. The mode of action of NE-100 is estimated to be the indirect modulation of the NMDA/PCP-receptor ion channel complex and the modulation of dopamine release from the dopaminergic nerve terminals. The recently reported MS-355/MS-377, which is also a selective sigma1-receptor antagonist, has a similar pharmacological profiles as NE-100, but in addition, MS-355/MS-377 inhibits methamphetamine-induced formation of reversal tolerance and also inhibits apomorphine-induced climbing behavior like dopamine D2-receptor antagonists. The report on clinical trial targeting schizophrenia shows results on rimcazole, remoxipride, BMY 14802, panamesine (EMD 57445) and SL 82.0715. Rimcazole was effective in the open study, but the double blind trial was discontinued due to seizure induction. Remoxipride showed efficacy different from those of dopamine D2-receptor antagonists (less extrapyramidal adverse effects), but the trial was discontinued due to occurrence of aplastic anemia.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Chemokine receptors are important therapeutic targets for the treatment of many human diseases. This study will provide an overview of approved chemokine receptor antagonists and promising candidates in advanced clinical trials.Areas covered: We will describe clinical aspects of chemokine receptor antagonists regarding their clinical efficacy, mechanisms of action, and re-purposed applications.Expert opinion: Three chemokine antagonists have been approved: (i) plerixafor is a small-molecule CXCR4 antagonist that mobilizes hematopoietic stem cells; (ii) maraviroc is a small-molecule CCR5 antagonist for anti-HIV treatment; and (iii) mogamulizumab is a monoclonal-antibody CCR4 antagonist for the treatment of mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome. Moreover, phase 3 trials are ongoing to evaluate many potent candidates, including CCR5 antagonists (e.g. leronlimab), dual CCR2/CCR5 antagonists (e.g. cenicriviroc), and CXCR4 antagonists (e.g. balixafortide, mavorixafor, motixafortide). The success of chemokine receptor antagonists depends on the selective blockage of disease-relevant chemokine receptors which are indispensable for disease progression. Although clinical translation has been slow, antagonists targeting chemokine receptors with multifaced functions offer the potential to treat a broad spectrum of human diseases.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) 1 A receptor agonists have a potentially marked neuroprotective reaction by both neuroprotective and hypothermic effects. We previously reported (1) the neuroprotective effect against the cerebral ischemia under normothermic condition, and (2) the hypothermic effect of the novel compound of 5-HT 1 A agonist, SUN N4057. The present investigation was designed to examine the enhancement of the neuroprotective effect by its pharmacological hypothermia. METHODS: In 24 anesthetized cats(body weight 1.9-4.6 kg), the left middle cerebral artery(MCA) occlusion was performed via the transorbital approach. Just after MCA occlusion, SUN N4057(6 micrograms/kg/min) was infused. Physiological parameters were measured continuously, and arterial blood gas was analyzed hourly for 6 hours and maintained within the normal ranges. Animals were randomly allocated to the following three groups: (1) ischemic controls infused with sterile saline(Group A, n = 8), (2) SUN N4057 under normothermic condition(Group B, n = 8), (3) SUN N4057 (Group C, n = 8). Then, brain coronal sections of 3 mm in thickness were stained with 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride(TTC) solution, and hemispheric infarct volumes were calculated by using a computerized image analysis system. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in any physiological parameters among 3 groups. In Group C, brain temperature decreased significantly starting 1 hour after MCA occlusion and dropped by 2.1 +/- 0.7 degrees C 5 hours. Infarct volumes were 35.6 +/- 6.9% (Group A), 23.3 +/- 5.8% (Group B) and 12.3 +/- 11.3% (Group C), respectively. There were significant differences among three groups(p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: On the basis of these data, we conclude that SUN N4057 provides more effective neuroprotection by the combination of hypothermic and neuroprotective effects. Chemical hypothermia may lead to a new therapeutic approaches for treatment of brain ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent introduction of a number of new compounds, there has of late been a cooling of interest by pharmaceutical companies in the development of centrally-active, selective kappa opioid agonists for therapeutic purposes. This is reflected in the discontinuation of a number of clinical trials, for reasons that are often not completely clear to outside observers. Spiradoline and enadoline have apparently been abandoned as potential analgesics because they induce dose-limiting central side-effects (i.e., dysphoria) in models of post-surgical pain. The development of niravoline as an aquaretic for the treatment of cirrhosis with ascites and other hyponatraemic disorders has also been halted. Enadoline may yet find some application against ischaemic stroke and severe head injury, presumably in comatose patients in whom psychiatric side-effects are taken to be immaterial, while apadoline and TRK 820 remain in Phase II clinical testing against cancer pain. The peripherally-selective kappa agonists, asimadoline, and the atypical compound, fedotozine, are well-tolerated in man. Results of Phase III trials of fedotozine against irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia have, however, ultimately been disappointing, whereas asimadoline is currently in Phase II clinical trials against pain of rheumatic and osteoarthritic origin. The results of these trials are eagerly awaited.",

    "title": "New pyrazoline bearing 4(3H)-quinazolinone inhibitors of monoamine oxidase: synthesis, biological evaluation, and structural determinants of MAO-A and MAO-B selectivity.",
    "abstract": "A new series of pyrazoline derivatives were prepared starting from a quinazolinone ring and evaluated for antidepressant, anxiogenic and MAO-A and -B inhibitory activities by in vivo and in vitro tests, respectively. Most of the synthesized compounds showed high activity against both the MAO-A (compounds 4a-4h, 4j-4n, and 5g-5l) and the MAO-B (compounds 4i and 5a-5f) isoforms. However, none of the novel compounds showed antidepressant activity except for 4b. The reason for such biological properties was investigated by computational methods using recently published crystallographic models of MAO-A and MAO-B. The differences in the intermolecular hydrophobic and H-bonding of ligands to the active site of each MAO isoform were correlated to their biological data. Compounds 4i, 4k, 5e, 5i, and 5l were chosen for their ability to reversibly inhibit MAO-B and MAO-A and the availability of experimental inhibition data. Observation of the docked positions of these ligands revealed interactions with many residues previously reported to have an effect on the inhibition of the enzyme. Among the pyrazoline derivatives, it appears that the binding interactions for this class of compounds are mostly hydrophobic. All have potential edge-to-face hydrophobic interactions with F343, as well as pi-pi stacking with Y398 and other hydrophobic interactions with L171. Strong hydrophobic and H-bonding interactions in the MAO recognition of 4i could be the reason why this compound shows selectivity toward the MAO-B isoform. The very high MAO-B selectivity for 4i can be also explained in terms of the distance between the FAD and the compound, which was greater in the complex of MAO-A-4i as compared to the corresponding MAO-B complex.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: HMN-214 is an oral prodrug of HMN-176, a stilbene derivative that interferes with the subcellular spatial location of polo-like kinase-1, a serine/threonine kinase that regulates critical mitotic events. We conducted a dose escalation study of HMN-214 in patients with advanced cancer to assess the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of HMN-214 and to establish the maximum tolerated dose. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-three patients were enrolled onto four dosing cohorts of HMN-214 from 3 to 9.9 mg/m2/d using a continuous 21-day dosing schedule every 28 days, with pharmacokinetic sampling during cycle 1. RESULTS: A severe myalgia/bone pain syndrome and hyperglycemia were dose-limiting toxicities at 9.9 mg/m2/d. A dose reduction and separate enrollment by pretreatment status (lightly versus heavily pretreated) was undertaken, with one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 bone pain) at 8 mg/m2/d. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as 8 mg/m2/d for both treatment cohorts. Dose-proportional increases were observed in AUC but not Cmax. There was no accumulation of HMN-176, the metabolite of HMN-214, with repeated dosing. Seven of 29 patients had stable disease as best tumor response, including 6-month stable disease in a heavily pretreated breast cancer patient. A transient decline in carcinoembryonic antigen in a patient with colorectal cancer was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of HMN-214 when administered on this schedule was 8 mg/m2/d regardless of pretreatment status. Further development of HMN-214 will focus on patient populations for which high expression of polo-like kinase-1 is seen (i.e., prostate and pancreatic cancer patients).",

    "title": "Probing the hirudin-thrombin interaction by incorporation of noncoded amino acids and molecular dynamics simulation.",
    "abstract": "Thrombin is a primary target for the development of novel anticoagulants, since it plays two important and opposite roles in hemostasis: procoagulant and anticoagulant. All thrombin functions are influenced by Na+ binding, which triggers the transition of this enzyme from an anticoagulant (slow) form to a procoagulant (fast) form. In previous studies, we have conveniently produced by chemical synthesis analogues of the N-terminal fragment 1-47 of hirudin HM2 containing noncoded amino acids and displaying up to approximately 2700-fold more potent antithrombin activity, comparable to that of full-length hirudin. In the work presented here, we have exploited the versatility of chemical synthesis to probe the structural and energetic properties of the S3 site of thrombin through perturbations introduced in the structure of hirudin fragment 1-47. In particular, we have investigated the effects of systematic replacement of Tyr3 with noncoded amino acids retaining the aromatic nucleus of Tyr, as well as similar hydrophobic and steric properties, but possessing different electronic (e.g., p-fluoro-, p-iodo-, or p-nitro-Phe), charge (p-aminomethyl-Phe), or conformational (homo-Phe) properties. Our results indicate that the affinity of fragment 1-47 for thrombin is proportional to the desolvation free energy change upon complex formation, and is inversely related to the electric dipole moment of the amino acid side chain at position 3 of hirudin. In this study, we have also identified the key features that are responsible for the preferential binding of hirudin to the procoagulant (fast) form of thrombin. Strikingly, shaving at position 3, by Tyr --&gt; Ala exchange, abolishes the differences in the affinity for thrombin allosteric forms, whereas a bulkier side chain (e.g., beta-naphthylalanine) improves binding preferentially to the fast form. These results provide strong, albeit indirect, evidence that the procoagulant (fast) form of thrombin is in a more open and accessible conformation with respect to the less forgiving structure it acquires in the slow form. This view is also supported by the results of molecular dynamics simulations conducted for 18 ns on free thrombin in full explicit water, showing that after approximately 5 ns thrombin undergoes a significant conformational transition, from a more open conformation (which we propose can be related to the fast form) to a more compact and closed one (which we propose can be related to the slow form). This transition mainly involves the Trp148 and Trp60D loop, the S3 site, and the fibrinogen binding site, whereas the S1 site, the Na+-binding site, and the catalytic pocket remain essentially unchanged. In particular, our data indicate that the S3 site of the enzyme is less accessible to water in the putative slow form. This structural picture provides a reasonable molecular explanation for the fact that physiological substrates related to the procoagulant activity of thrombin (fibrinogen, thrombin receptor 1, and factor XIII) orient a bulky side chain into the S3 site of the enzyme. Taken together, our results can have important implications for the design of novel thrombin inhibitors, of practical utility in the treatment of coagulative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Atherogenesis in the vasculature is accelerated by changes in the dynamic equilibrium between endogenous tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Increased expression of PAI-1, decreased expression of tissue plasminogen activator, or both can lead to decreased fibrinolytic activity and predispose to thrombosis. Increased concentrations of insulin (and proinsulin) in the plasma increase plasma PAI-1, although the mechanisms of this effect are not known. In addition, it has been observed that basal fibrinolytic activity is decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes; this may accelerate atherosclerosis by exposing vascular luminal wall surfaces to persistent and recurrent thrombi. Abnormalities in the vessel wall appear to contribute to the increased risk. There is also evidence that PAI-1 content is increased in atherosclerotic lesions of patients with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that interventions to reduce insulin resistance and improve glycemic control may improve the fibrinolytic response. Clinical studies in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (characterized by insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, ovarian androgen overproduction, and impaired fibrinolytic capacity) demonstrated that treatment with troglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing agent, can markedly reduce blood levels of PAI-1. There is also clinical evidence that these agents may contribute to regression of intimal medial thickness in patients with type 2 diabetes, providing further indication that antidiabetic interventions may help inhibit the progression of early atherosclerotic lesions.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to characterize pharmacologically the 5-HT receptor(s) mediating contraction in the mouse aorta and the pathways these receptors are coupled with to mediate contraction. We hypothesized that a 5-HT2A receptor, as in the rat, mediates contraction by activating L-type calcium channels, phospholipase C (PLC), and tyrosine kinase(s). Endothelium-denuded aortic strips were placed in a tissue bath for measurement of isometric contractile force. 5-HT, the 5-HT2A receptor agonist alpha-methyl-5-HT, and partial 5-HT2A receptor agonist (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (+/--DOI) caused the most potent and efficacious contraction. The 5-HT(1E/1F) receptor agonist BRL 54443 also induced contraction (-log EC(50) = 6.52); however, the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin antagonized this contraction. Our hypothesis was further supported by the finding that antagonists with affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor, ketanserin, 1-(1-naphthyl)piperazine, spiperone, and LY53857, reduced 5-HT-induced contraction. A correlation of 0.927 was found between literature-derived compound binding affinities for the agonists and antagonists at the 5-HT2A receptor of the rat and the data generated in our experiments (-log EC(50) and pK(B) values). The L-type calcium channel blockers nifedipine and nitrendipine, PLC inhibitor 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenylcarbamate, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and PD 098,059 all shifted and/or reduced maximum contraction to 5-HT. We conclude that contraction to 5-HT in the mouse aorta is mediated primarily by a 5-HT2A receptor and is coupled to L-type calcium channels, PLC, and tyrosine kinases.",

METHODS: This 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled trial was conducted at 60 centers across the United States. Male and female patients aged &gt;or=35 years with physician-diagnosed COPD received arformoterol (15 microg BID, 25 microg BID, or 50 microg QD via nebulizer), salmeterol (42 microg BID via metered dose inhaler), or placebo. Pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry; dyspnea, by the Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI); and health status, by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by site personnel at all clinic visits (screening, first dose at week 0, and at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and follow-up). COPD exacerbations were defined as worsening respiratory status requiring a change in medication or an unscheduled provider visit. RESULTS: A total of 717 patients received study medication. The demographic composition of all treatment arms was similar. The mean age was 62.9 years, 58% were men, and mean baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) was 1.2 L (41% predicted). Mean improvement in trough FEV(1) over 12 weeks was significantly greater with all 3 arformoterol doses (15 microg BID, +16.9%; 25 microg BID, +18.9%; 50 microg QD, +14.9%) and for salmeterol (+17.4%) relative to placebo (+6.0%; P &lt; 0.001). There were significantly greater improvements in the mean percentage change in FEV(1) AUC(0-12h) from the predose value over 12 weeks (15 microg BID, 12.7%, 25 microg BID, 13.9%, 50 microg QD, 18.9%; salmeterol, 9.8%) versus placebo (2.7%; P &lt;or= 0.001); all doses of arformoterol were statistically different from salmeterol for this end point (P &lt;or= 0.024). At week 12, TDI focal scores were significantly greater with all arformoterol doses compared with placebo (mean [95% CI]: 15 microg BID, 0.97 [0.25-1.69]; 25 microg BID, 1.08 [0.3-1.86]; 50 microg QD, 1.04 [0.32-1.771), suggesting treatment-associated improvement in dyspnea, however, the difference between salmeterol and placebo was not statistically significant (0.36 [-0.40 to 1.12]). Improvements in health status, as measured using SGRQ total scores, were -2.6 to -3.6 U in the arformoterol groups, -4.4 U for salmeterol, and -1.2 U for placebo; 95% CI of differences versus placebo suggested significant improvement for the arformoterol 25 microg BID and salmeterol groups. There was a similar frequency of AEs and COPD exacerbations across all groups, including placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, patients with moderate to severe COPD administered nebulized arformoterol over 12 weeks were observed to have significant and sustained improvements in airway function and dyspnea compared with placebo. The results also suggest that all doses of arformoterol, including the lowest dose (15 microg BID), were effective. Overall, nebulized arformoterol was well tolerated.",

    "abstract": "This work describes the discovery and characterization of a novel series of tricyclic natural product-derived metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors. Natural product screening of the Bacillus cereus II enzyme identified an extract from a strain of Chaetomium funicola with inhibitory activity against metallo-beta-lactamases. SB236050, SB238569, and SB236049 were successfully extracted and purified from this extract. The most active of these compounds was SB238569, which possessed K(i) values of 79, 17, and 3.4 microM for the Bacillus cereus II, Pseudomonas aeruginosa IMP-1, and Bacteroides fragilis CfiA metallo-beta-lactamases, respectively, yet none of the compounds exhibited any inhibitory activity against the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia L-1 metallo-beta-lactamase (50% inhibitory concentration &gt; 1,000 microM). The lack of activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme and serine beta-lactamases demonstrated the selective nature of these compounds. The crystal structure of SB236050 complexed in the active site of CfiA has been obtained to a resolution of 2.5 A. SB236050 exhibits key polar interactions with Lys184, Asn193, and His162 and a stacking interaction with the indole ring of Trp49 in the flap, which is in the closed conformation over the active site groove. SB236050 and SB238569 also demonstrate good antibacterial synergy with meropenem. Eight micrograms of SB236050 per ml gave rise to an eightfold drop in the MIC of meropenem for two clinical isolates of B. fragilis producing CfiA, making these strains sensitive to meropenem (MIC &lt; or = 4 microg/ml). Consequently, this series of metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors exhibit the most promising antibacterial synergy activity so far observed against organisms producing metallo-beta-lactamases.",

    "abstract": "The human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) have been widely used as one mammalian expression system in the study of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels. Understanding the endogenous Kv channels in these cells is the prerequisite for the characterization of the heterogeneously expressed Kv channels in these cells. In the present study we screened the transcriptional expression of different Kv genes in HEK-293 cells using reverse transcribed DNApolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Among 16 Kv genes examined in native HEK-293 cells 10 Kv genes were reproducibly amplified, including those Kv a subunits encoding for the delayed rectifier (IK) [Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.6, and Kv3.1], and for the transient outward Kv channels (IA) [Kv1.4, Kv3.3, Kv3.4, and Kv4.1] as well as a Kvbeta2 subunit. The whole-cell outward rectifier IK currents in the native HEK-293 cells were recorded (203 +/- 13 pA at +30 mV, n = 82) with the patch-clamp technique. In about 42% of the examined cells, IA coexisted with IK currents. IK currents were inhibited by tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) at 1 and 10 mM by 39.5 and 48.4%, respectively. A 39.6% inhibition of IK currents was also observed in the presence of4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 5 mM). Interestingly, both TEAand 4-AP also inhibited IA currents. 4-acelamido-4'-isothiocyanalostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid (1 mM), a Cl- channel blocker, had no effect on the endogenous outward currents. We concluded that multiple endogenous Kv genes were expressed in native HEK-293 cells, which possessed significant endogenous IK and IA currents with unique pharmacological properties.",

    "abstract": "Adrogolide (ABT-431; DAS-431) is a chemically stable prodrug that is converted rapidly (<1 min) in plasma to A-86929, a full agonist at dopamine D1 receptors. In in vitro functional assays, A-86929 is over 400 times more selective for dopamine D1 than D2 receptors. In rats with a unilateral loss of striatal dopamine, A-86929 produces contralateral rotations that are inhibited by dopamine D1 but not by dopamine D2 receptor antagonists. Adrogolide improves behavioral disability and locomotor activity scores in MPTP-lesioned marmosets, a model of Parkinson's disease (PD), and shows no tolerance upon repeated dosing for 28 days. In PD patients, intravenous (i.v.) adrogolide has antiparkinson efficacy equivalent to that of L-DOPA with a tendency towards a reduced liability to induce dyskinesia. The adverse events associated with its use were of mild-to-moderate severity and included injection site reaction, asthenia, headache, nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension, vasodilitation, and dizziness. Adrogolide can also attenuate the ability of cocaine to induce cocaine-seeking behavior and does not itself induce cocaine-seeking behavior in a rodent model of cocaine craving and relapse. In human cocaine abusers, i.v. adrogolide reduces cocaine craving and other cocaine-induced subjective effects. The results of animal abuse liability studies indicate that adrogolide is unlikely to have abuse potential in man. Adrogolide has also been reported to reverse haloperidol-induced cognitive deficits in monkeys, suggesting that it may be an effective treatment for the cognitive dysfunction associated with aging and disease. Adrogolide undergoes a high hepatic \"first-pass\" metabolism in man after oral dosing and, as a result, has a low oral bioavailability (approximately 4%). This limitation may potentially be circumvented by oral inhalation formulations for intrapulmonary delivery that greatly increase the bioavailability of adrogolide. As the first full dopamine D1 receptor agonist to show efficacy in PD patients and to reduce the craving and subjective effects of cocaine in cocaine abusers, adrogolide represents an important tool in understanding the pharmacotherapeutic potential of dopamine D1 receptor agonists.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced myocardial dysfunction has not been clearly defined. Our aim was to investigate the contribution of p38 MAPK in myocardial tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression, cardiac function and survival during acute endotoxemia in mice. METHODS: Acute endotoxemia was induced by LPS (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice. Two hours after LPS treatment, left ventricular (LV) function was assessed. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was measured by Western blotting. TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels were determined by semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: LPS rapidly increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, followed by TNF-alpha mRNA expression and protein expression in the LV myocardium. Pre-treatment of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (2 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased TNF-alpha mRNA and protein by 65 and 36%, respectively (P&lt;0.05). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed that cardiomyocytes were the major source of TNF-alpha production in the myocardium and blocking p38 MAPK activation inhibited TNF-alpha expression in response to LPS. Pre-treatment of SB202190 or a TNF-alpha antagonist etanercept (2 mg/kg, i.p) significantly reversed LPS-induced LV depression (P&lt;0.05). LPS (20 mg/kg, i.p.) induced 94% mortality in mice within 72 h and pre-treatment with SB202190 and etanercept decreased LPS-induced mortality to 65 and 40%, respectively (P&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: p38 MAPK activation represents an important mechanism leading to myocardial TNF-alpha production and cardiac dysfunction during acute endotoxemia in mice. Our data suggest that p38 MAPK is a potential therapeutic target of endotoxemia.",

    "abstract": "Differing effects of labetalol and dilevalol on cardiovascular preparations have been reported. I have studied the effects of labetalol and dilevalol on the contractile responses of the rat and guinea-pig left atria and rat portal vein. On the guinea-pig left atria low concentrations of labetalol (&gt; or = 10(-8) M) and of dilevalol (&gt; or = 10(-7) M) inhibited to a small extent the responses to electrical cardiac stimulation, which is indicative of membrane stabilizing activity. Labetalol (&gt; or = 3 x 10(-8) M) and dilevalol (&gt; or = 10(-8) M) caused surmountable antagonism of the isoprenaline responses of the atria and the pA2 values were 8.60 and 8.98 at the beta 1-adrenoceptors of the rat left atria and 7.90 and 8.31, respectively, on the guinea-pig left atria which has functional beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Labetalol and dilevalol (both at &gt; or = 10(-7) M) attenuated the spontaneous contractile activity of the rat portal vein and the attenuation to labetalol at 10(-6) M was abolished by ICI 118,551 which illustrates that the labetalol-induced attenuation is beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated. The isoprenaline attenuation responses of the portal vein were inhibited by labetalol and dilevalol (both at &gt; or = 10(-7) M) and the pA2 value for the labetalol at beta 2-adrenoceptors was 7.59. It is concluded that labetalol and dilevalol are beta 1-adrenoceptor selective antagonists.",

    "title": "Is mutated serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) involved in the etiology of neural tube defects?",
    "abstract": "Neural tube defects (NTD) arise in the first weeks of pregnancy due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors. In mothers of children with NTD elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels and decreased plasma folate levels were observed, which suggests a defect in the folate-dependent Hcy metabolism. Therefore, mutations in genes coding for enzymes of this metabolism could be involved in NTD. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) catalyzes the reversible reaction of serine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) to glycine and 5,10-methylene THF. Two different isoforms of SHMT are known, one is present in the cytosol (cSHMT) and the other in the mitochondrion (mSHMT). Theoretically, mutated SHMT could lead to elevated Hcy levels and to an altered distribution of the different folate derivatives and might therefore become a risk factor for NTD. This study concerns the molecular genetic analysis of genes coding for both isoforms of the SHMT enzyme by single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis. Several mutations as well as polymorphisms were found in both genes. The relevance of two variations, the 1420 C&gt;T mutation of the cytosolic isoform and the 4-bp deletion of the mitochondrial isoform (delTCTT 1721-1724), to NTD risk was tested in a study group, which consisted of 109 NTD patients, 120 mothers of children with NTD, and 420 controls. Neither of the two polymorphisms led to an increased risk of NTD. In mothers with the 1420 CC genotype, significant increased Hcy levels are present. Also, significantly decreased red blood cell folate and plasma folate levels were present in individuals with the 1420 CC genotype. Probably, the 1420 C&gt;T polymorphism causes a shift in distribution of the different folate derivatives. The 4-bp deletion of the mSHMT gene did not lead to altered Hcy or folate levels. So far, the results of this study provide no direct evidence for a role of defective SHMT functioning in NTD. Still, the influence of the 1420 C&gt;T polymorphism of the cSHMT gene on the folate-related risk of NTD needs further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Pramipexole is a clinically effective nonergot dopamine agonist. Pramipexole's receptor interactions differ from ergot agonists in several ways. First, it has high selectivity for interacting with dopamine D2 subfamily receptors (D2, D3, and D4 receptor subtypes) and has little interaction with adrenergic or serotonergic receptors. Second, within the D2 subfamily, it has preferential affinity for the D3 receptor subtype, which, according to preclinical studies, could contribute additional efficacy for treatment of both motor and psychiatric syndromes in Parkinson's disease. Third, it has full intrinsic activity at dopamine D2 subfamily receptors. In addition to pramipexole's unusual receptor profile, whole-animal and cell culture studies suggest that pramipexole might provide neuroprotective effects through depression of dopamine metabolism, antioxidant effects, and stimulation of trophic activity. Pramipexole's demonstrated clinical efficacy for successful treatment in early disease for several years in the absence of L-dopa and as adjunctive therapy with L-dopa in late disease suggests a potential new paradigm for treatment of Parkinson's disease whereby new patients are initiated with pramipexole therapy and L-dopa is added only as necessary.",

Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) has been shown to be a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregant. It may be possible to produce a vasodilatory and anti-thrombotic effect by blockade of the TXA2 receptors. ICI 192,605 is a potent TXA2 receptor antagonist and we studied its effects on platelet aggregation and digital blood flow in patients with RS. Sixteen patients with RS completed this double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study. Each patient was seen on three separate occasions and was given ICI 192,605 (100 mg orally) on one occasion and matching placebo tablets on the other two. We measured platelet aggregation using platelet rich plasma (PRP) stimulated by U46619, a thromboxane (TX) mimetic. The concentration of U46619 required to cause just over 50% platelet aggregation before the administration of either ICI 192,605 or placebo (pre-dose) was noted. The same concentration of U46619 was used to stimulate the PRP sample at 1 h after the administration of ICI 192,605 or placebo (post-dose) and the percentage of platelet aggregation was again noted. Fingertip skin blood flow was also measured 1.25 h post-dose using a laser Doppler flowmeter. Patients were seated in a temperature controlled chamber which was initially heated to 40 degrees C to induce centrally mediated vasodilatation. The temperature was then lowered to 12 degrees C followed by rewarming to 40 degrees C. Steady blood flow values at these temperatures were measured and the rates of cooling and rewarming were also noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a group of uncommon mature T-cell lymphomas presenting primarily or exclusively in the skin. The most common subtype, mycosis fungoides and its leukemic variant Sezary syndrome, frequently behave as a chronic lymphoma with good prognosis for early-stage disease and shortened survival only for patients in advanced stages. Historically, these patients have experienced excessive toxicity from chemotherapy without durable benefit, leading to current conservative treatment strategies. An increasing number of novel therapies are available or in development. These newer therapies often have unique mechanisms of action and different toxicities with less myelosuppression than traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Among these novel systemic therapies are so-called biologic therapies such as retinoids like bexarotene, the fusion toxin denileukin diftitox, lenalidomide, and toll-like receptor agonists. Other important novel or emerging agents include the histone deacetylase inhibitors; a novel antifolate, pralatrexate; the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib; and the purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitor forodesine. Even agents considered to be conventional chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, have demonstrated activity in CTCL at relatively lower doses with less myelosuppression. The mechanisms of action of the novel agents are reviewed as well as available clinical data. As the role of these new agents is better understood, particularly with regard to nonoverlapping toxicities, combination strategies might emerge. Evaluation through carefully designed clinical trials should lead to better, safer, and more effective treatment strategies in the future.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To test the efficacy of the novel candidate anticonvulsant talampanel (GYKI 53773) in a rodent model of hypoxic neonatal seizures. Talampanel is a noncompetitive antagonist of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid subtype of the glutamate receptor (AMPAR). We have previously shown that AMPARs play a critical role in the generation of acute seizures and later-life seizure susceptibility in this model of neonatal seizures. METHODS: Seizures were induced in postnatal day (P) 10 Long-Evans rat pups by a 15 min exposure to global hypoxia. Acute seizure activity at P10 and subsequent susceptibility to seizure-induced neuronal injury with a \"second-hit\" kainate-induced seizure at P30-31 were compared between animals receiving talampanel (1, 5, 7.5, or 10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p.) versus saline vehicle treatment. RESULTS: Talampanel treatment suppressed seizures in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal effect at 7.5 and 10 mg/kg. In addition, talampanel treatment 30 min before hypoxia prevented later-life increases in seizure-induced neuronal injury as assessed by in situ DNA nick end-labeling (ISEL). DISCUSSION: We have previously demonstrated efficacy of other AMPAR antagonists such as NBQX and topiramate in this model. The present finding shows that the novel agent talampanel, under evaluation as an antiepileptic drug in children and adults, may have clinical potential in the treatment of neonatal seizures, particularly those occurring in the context of hypoxic encephalopathy.",

    "abstract": "Carbimazole (CBZ) is one of the major drugs currently used for the treatment of Graves' disease. It is a carbethoxy derivative of methimazole (MMI), originally developed in the hope of obtaining a longer acting drug than methimazole. In the present study we have demonstrated that carbimazole is rapidly converted to methimazole in vitro by serum from rats and humans, and we have obtained evidence that this conversion is enzymatic. Experiments with [35S] CBZ in rats showed that the drug is so rapidly transformed to MMI after i.v. injection (within 3 min) that very little of the unchanged drug would be expected to reach the thyroid gland. The antithyroid action of CBZ in rats, therefore, can be ascribed entirely to the MMI to which it is rapidly converted. Although no experiments were performed with human subjects in vivo, the very rapid conversion of CBZ to MMI by human serum in vitro suggests that the antithyroid action of CBZ in humans can also be attributed to MMI. The original expectation of a longer acting drug has, therefore, not been met by CBZ. On the basis of the studies reported here there appears to be no advantage in using CBZ in preference to MMI for the treatment of Graves' disease. Although the in vivo action of CBZ must be attributed to its rapid conversion to MMI, the drug does possess inherent antithyroid activity. This was shown in the present study by the finding that CBZ is as potent as MMI in blocking thyroid peroxidase-catalysed iodination of thyroglobulin.",

Here we evaluate the potency, in vivo efficacy, and safety of a selected set of these inhibitors. The adverse effects induced by boronic acid-based DPP-IV inhibitors are essentially limited to what has been observed previously for non-boronic acid inhibitors and attributed to cross-reactivity with DPP8/9. While consistent with the DPP8/9 hypothesis, they are also consistent with cross-reactivity with some other intracellular target.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Activation of principal hippocampal neurons is controlled by feedforward and feedback inhibition mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons. The effects of halothane on glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic excitation of inhibitory interneurons have not been reported yet. METHODS: The effects of halothane on glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents and on spike threshold in visually identified interneurons were studied with tight-seal, whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp recordings in thin slices from adult mouse hippocampus. The excitatory postsynaptic currents were pharmacologically isolated into their N-methyl-D-aspartate and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated components using selective antagonists. RESULTS: Halothane (0.37-2.78 mM) reversibly blocked non-N-methyl-D-aspartate and N-methyl-D-aspartate excitatory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal oriens-alveus interneurons. Half-maximal inhibition was observed at similar concentrations (0.59 mM and 0.50 mM, respectively). Halothane inhibited synaptically generated action potentials at concentrations that did not elevate the spike threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Halothane blocks glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic activation of inhibitory interneurons in the mouse hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As the role of lipids and inflammation in the genesis and progression of the atherosclerosis disease is unquestionable, novel treatment modalities that target both aspects are currently under investigation. RECENT FINDINGS: For a long time atherosclerosis was regarded as a lipid-driven disease, but now it is evident that it also involves the simultaneous and combined effect of inflammation and immunological pathways. The secreted PLA2s and the lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) have been associated with atherogenesis and its complications. These two enzymes produce biologically active metabolites that are involved in several phases of the atherosclerosis process. SUMMARY: In animal, pathological and epidemiological studies, the increased levels of these two phospholipases (i.e. PLA2s and Lp-PLA2) have been related with an increase in complex coronary lesions and increase in major cardiovascular clinical events, respectively. Therefore, inhibition of these enzymes has become the focus of research in this last decennium. Novel pharmacological inhibitors of those enzymes such as darapladib and varespladib emerge as promising therapeutical options for treating patients with coronary artery disease. Ongoing mechanistic and clinical outcome trials will further elucidate their role in this context.",

    "title": "Theoretical possibilities for the development of novel antiarrhythmic drugs.",
    "abstract": "One possible mechanism of action of the available K-channel blocking agents used to treat arrhythmias is to selectively inhibit the HERG plus MIRP channels, which carry the rapid delayed rectifier outward potassium current (I(Kr)). These antiarrhythmics, like sotalol, dofetilide and ibutilide, have been classified as Class III antiarrhythmics. However, in addition to their beneficial effect, they substantially lengthen ventricular repolarization in a reverse-rate dependent manner. This latter effect, in certain situations, can result in life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes). Selective blockers (chromanol 293B, HMR-1556, L-735,821) of the KvLQT1 plus minK channel, which carriy the slow delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Ks)), were also considered to treat arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF). However, I(Ks) activates slowly and at a more positive voltage than the plateau of the action potential, therefore it remains uncertain how inhibition of this current would result in a therapeutically meaningful repolarization lengthening. The transient outward potassium current (I(to)), which flows through the Kv 4.3 and Kv 4.2 channels, is relatively large in the atrial cells, which suggests that inhibition of this current may cause substantial prolongation of repolarization predominantly in the atria. Although it was reported that some antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, disopyramide, flecainide, propafenone, tedisamil) inhibit I(to), no specific blockers for I(to) are currently available. Similarly, no specific inhibitors for the Kir 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 channels, which carry the inward rectifier potassium current (I(kl)), have been developed making difficult to judge the possible beneficial effects of such drugs in both ventricular arrhythmias and AF. Recently, a specific potassium channel (Kv 1.5 channel) has been described in human atrium, which carries the ultrarapid, delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Kur)). The presence of this current has not been observed in the ventricular muscle, which raises the possibility that by specific inhibition of this channel, atrial repolarization can be lengthened without similar effect in the ventricle. Therefore, AF could be terminated and torsades de pointes arrhythmia avoided. Several compounds were reported to inhibit I(Kur)(flecainide, tedisamil, perhexiline, quinidine, ambasilide, AVE 0118), but none of them can be considered as specific for Kv 1.5 channels. Similarly to Kv 1.5 channels, acetylcholine activated potassium channels carry repolarizing current (I(KAch)) in the atria and not in the ventricle during normal vagal tone and after parasympathetic activation. Specific blockers of I(KAch) can, therefore, also be a possible candidate to treat AF without imposing proarrhythmic risk on the ventricle. At present several compounds (amiodarone, dronedarone, aprindine, pirmenol, SD 3212) were shown to inhibit I(KAch) but none of them proved to be selective. Further research is needed to develop specific K-channel blockers, such as I(Kur)and I(KAch) inhibitors, and to establish their possible therapeutic value.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review the mechanisms of action of methylnaltrexone and its effects on opioid bowel dysfunction, as well as its effects on other opioid-induced adverse effects (ADEs), and its potential roles in clinical practice. DATA SOURCES: A literature search using the MEDLINE and Cochrane Collaboration databases for articles published between 1966 and March 2007 was performed. Additional data sources were obtained from manual searches of recent journal articles, book chapters, and monographs. An updated literature search showed no additional publications. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Abstracts and original preclinical and clinical research reports published in the English language were identified for review. Review articles, commentaries, and news reports of this compound were excluded. Literature related to opioids, opioid receptors, opioid antagonists, methylnaltrexone, opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, constipation, nausea, and vomiting was evaluated and selected based on consideration of the support shown for the proof of concept, mechanistic findings, and timeliness. Fifty-eight original articles from preclinical studies and clinical trials using methylnaltrexone were identified. Pharmacologic action, benefits, and ADEs of methylnaltrexone were reviewed, with a focus on its effects on bowel dysfunction after opioids. Emphases were placed on its receptor binding activities and therapeutically relevant sites of action (peripheral vs central), in which peripheral opioid receptors in the body contribute to physiological and drug-induced effects. DATA SYNTHESIS: Morphine and related opioids are associated with a number of limiting ADEs, including opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Methylnaltrexone, a quaternary derivative of naltrexone, blocks peripheral effects of opioids while sparing central analgesic effects. It is currently under late-stage clinical investigation for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness. Reported results showed the drug to be generally well-tolerated. The rapid reversal of constipation is very encouraging. Hastening postoperative discharge may also be possible. CONCLUSIONS: Methylnaltrexone has the potential to prevent or treat opioid-induced peripherally mediated ADEs on bowel dysfunction without interfering with central analgesia. The study of methylnaltrexone leads to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of action of opioid pharmacology.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin II receptor antagonists block angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors and reduce the pressor effects of angiotensin in the vasculature. By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure (BP). However, AT1 antagonists differ from ACE inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, which is related to bradykinin activation. Within the class of angiotensin II antagonists, eprosartan differs from other currently clinically available agents in terms of its chemical structure and its dual pharmacological mode of action. Eprosartan acts not only at vascular AT1 receptors but also at presynaptic AT1 receptors, causing inhibition of sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release. Eprosartan is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes and therefore has a low potential for metabolic drug interactions, which may be of importance when treating the elderly and patients on multiple drugs. In clinical trials eprosartan has proven to be at least as effective as the ACE inhibitor enalapril in reducing BP, but with a significantly lower incidence of side effects. Eprosartan is safe, effective and well tolerated in long-term treatment, either as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide.",

    "abstract": "Postganglionic sympathetic neurons and brain noradrenergic neurons use alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors as presynaptic autoreceptors. The present experiments were carried out in order to see whether they possess presynaptic alpha(2B)-autoreceptors as well. Pieces of atria, vasa deferentia, the occipito-parietal cortex and the hippocampus were prepared from either wildtype (WT) mice or mice in which both the alpha(2A)- and the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor gene had been disrupted (alpha(2AC)KO). The pieces were incubated with (3)H-noradrenaline and then superfused and stimulated electrically. In a first series of experiments, single pulses or brief, autoinhibition-poor pulse trains were used for stimulation. The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14,304 (brimonidine) reduced the evoked overflow of tritium in all four tissues from WT mice but did not change it in any tissue from alpha(2AC)KO mice. A different pattern was obtained with medetomidine as alpha(2 )agonist. Like UK 14,304, medetomidine reduced the evoked overflow of tritium in all four tissues from WT mice and did not affect overflow in brain slices from alpha(2AC)KO mice; however, in contrast to UK 14,304, medetomidine reduced evoked overflow also in atrial and vas deferens pieces from alpha(2AC)KO mice, although with a lower maximum and potency than in WT preparations. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists rauwolscine, phentolamine, prazosin, spiroxatrine and WB 4101 shifted the concentration-response curve of medetomidine in alpha(2AC)KO atria and vasa deferentia to the right. The pK(d) values of the five antagonists against medetomidine in alpha(2AC)KO atria and vasa deferentia correlated with pK(d) values at prototypical alpha(2B) radioligand binding sites but not at alpha(2A) or alpha(2C) binding sites. In a second series of experiments, autoinhibition-rich pulse trains were used for stimulation. Under these conditions, rauwolscine and phentolamine increased the evoked overflow of tritium from alpha(2AC)KO atrial and vas deferens pieces but not from alpha(2AC)KO brain slices. The increase was smaller (by 40% in atria and by 70% in the vas deferens) than previously observed in WT preparations (by 200-400%). In a last series of experiments, mRNA for the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor was demonstrated by RT-PCR in thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglia from WT, alpha(2A)KO, alpha(2C)KO and alpha(2AC)KO mice but not from alpha(2B)KO mice. The results show that brain noradrenergic neurons express only alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors as autoreceptors. Postganglionic sympathetic neurons, however, can express alpha(2B)-adrenoceptors as presynaptic autoreceptors as well. The alpha(2B)-autoreceptors are activated by medetomidine but not by UK 14,304. They are also activated by previously released noradrenaline. The two-alpha(2)-autoreceptor hypothesis has to be replaced by a three-autoreceptor hypothesis for postganglionic sympathetic neurons.",

    "abstract": "The design of compounds selective for the MT1 melatonin receptor is still a challenging task owing to the limited knowledge of the structural features conferring selectivity for the MT1 subtype, and only few selective compounds have been reported so far. N-(Anilinoalkyl)amides are a versatile class of melatonin receptor ligands that include nonselective MT1/MT2 agonists and MT2-selective antagonists. We synthesized a new series of N-(anilinoalkyl)amides bearing 3-arylalkyloxy or 3-alkyloxy substituents at the aniline ring, looking for new potent and MT1-selective ligands. To evaluate the effect of substituent size and shape on binding affinity and intrinsic activity, both flexible and conformationally constrained derivatives were prepared. The phenylbutyloxy substituent gave the best result, providing the partial agonist 4 a, which was endowed with high MT1 binding affinity (pKi=8.93) and 78-fold selectivity for the MT1 receptor. To investigate the molecular basis for agonist recognition, and to explain the role of the 3-arylalkyloxy substituent, we built a homology model of the MT1 receptor based on the beta2 adrenergic receptor crystal structure in its activated state. A binding mode for MT1 agonists is proposed, as well as a hypothesis regarding the receptor structural features responsible for MT1 selectivity of compounds with lipophilic arylalkyloxy substituents.",

    "title": "Recent insights into the role of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV) and aminopeptidase N (APN) families in immune functions.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the past, different research groups could show that treatment of immune cells with inhibitors of post-proline splitting dipeptidyl aminopeptidases leads to functional changes in the immune system consistent with immunosuppression. This is due to the inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes and the production of inflammatory cytokines of the TH1, TH2, and TH17, cells as well as the induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and interleukin (IL)-1RA. Until recently, most of the effects of these inhibitors on immune functions were attributed to the inhibition of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV/CD26). With the identification of new peptidases of the DPIV family (DASH) with the same or similar substrate specificity [fibroblast activation protein (FAP), DP8/9], the question arose whether and to what extent the inhibition of intracellularly localized enzymes, DP8 and DP9, contribute to the observed immunosuppression. In addition, members of the aminopeptidase N (APN) family are also involved in the regulation of immune functions. Hence, the concept of a combined targeting of both families of peptidases for treatment of inflammatory diseases is a promising strategy. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Summarizing data obtained from the usage of different non-selective and selective inhibitors of DPIV, DP8/9, FAP, and DPII, this review provides evidence that in addition to DPIV, DP8/9 also regulate the immune response via modulation of cell cycle progression and cytokine production. The strongest and most consistent effects in vitro were, however, observed with non-selective inhibitors for the suppression of DNA synthesis and cytokine production. Similar effects were provoked by APN inhibitors, which were also found to suppress DNA synthesis and the production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. However, different mechanisms and signaling pathways appear to mediate the cellular effects resulting from the inhibition of either APN or DPIV family members. In particular, members of the APN family uniquely influence the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells. Consequently, the concomitant inhibition of both APN and DPIV enzyme families by means of two separate inhibitors or by binary inhibitors with specificity for both enzyme families (PETIR, peptidase targeted immunoregulation) synergistically affects immune cells on the level of cell cycle regulation, suppression of TH1, TH2, and TH17 cytokines as well as the activation of regulatory T-cells. Besides leukocytes, dermal cells as sebocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts are also targeted by these inhibitors. This strongly suggests a broad potential of the multiple anti-inflammatory effects of PETIR in treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and transplant rejections, as well as of inflammatory skin diseases, such as acne, psoriasis, rosacea or atopic dermatitis. The first active dual inhibitor, IP10.C8, has been developed by IMTM for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and has just entered the first phase II study.",

Dysregulated histamine neurotransmission is associated with an altered circadian rhythmicity that is partially restored following central histamine H1 receptor blockade in cirrhotic animals. We studied the effects of the histamine H1 blocker hydroxyzine in sleep alterations in patients with cirrhosis in a double-blind, randomized controlled fashion. METHODS: A total of 35 patients (age 56 yr [36-69], Pugh's score 9 [7-12], portosystemic shunt: N = 7) with minimal HE and long-standing sleep difficulties (8 months [4-48]) and free from benzodiazepines were randomized to hydroxyzine 25 mg at bedtime (N = 17) or placebo (N = 18) for a 10-day period. Measurements of sleep behavior using visual analog scale and wrist actigraphy, neuropsychological tests, and protein s100beta serum levels were performed at baseline and at day 10. RESULTS: Subjective improvement in sleep was observed in 40% of hydroxyzine-treated patients but in none receiving placebo (P &lt; 0.04). Objectively, 65% of hydroxyzine-treated patients versus 25% of patients under placebo had a &gt;or=30% increase in sleep efficiency as measured by wrist actigraphy (P &lt; 0.04). Neuropsychological tests (Z scores) and protein s100beta levels remained statistically unchanged in both groups. One patient developed an acute episode of encephalopathy reversible upon cessation of hydroxyzine. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to placebo, hydroxyzine 25 mg at bedtime improved sleep behavior (subjectively and using wrist actigraphy) in patients with cirrhosis and minimal HE. The risk of precipitating overt HE warrants some caution when prescribing this drug.",

Inhibition of ET-1 activation by the endothelin-converting enzymes 1(a)(-)(d) (ECE-1(a)(-)(d); EC 3.4.24.71) represents another approach to block the ET-1 effect in cancer. To evaluate this potential, we synthesized and characterized a series of low nanomolar nonpeptidic thiol-containing ECE-1 inhibitors, and evaluated their effect, as well as the effect of inhibitors for the related metalloproteases neprilysin (NEP; EC 3.4.24.11) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1), on human glioblastoma cell growth. Only ECE-1 inhibitors inhibited DNA synthesis by human glioblastoma cells. Exogenous addition of ET-1 or bigET-1 to glioblastoma cells did not counterbalance the growth inhibition elicited by ECE-1 inhibitors, suggesting that ECE-1 inhibitors block the proliferation of human glioblastoma cells most likely via a mechanism not involving extracellular production of ET-1. This class of molecules may thus represent novel therapeutic agents for the potential treatment of human cancer.",

(+/-)- SDZ NVI 085 had no effect upon caudal arteries precontracted with vasopressin or U46619 (9,11-dideoxy-11 alpha, 9 alpha-epoxymethano-prostaglandin F2 alpha). In other studies, (+/-)-SDZ NVI 085 shifted 5-HT concentration-effect curves to the right, in a concentration-dependent manner, and Schild regression gave a pA2 estimate of 8.0 (slope of 1.0). Experiments using pharmacological resultant analysis indicated a syntopic interaction of (+/-)-SDZ NVI 085 with ketanserin (a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist) toward 5-HT-induced contractions. It is concluded that (+/-)-SDZ NVI 085 behaves as a reversible competitive 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, a property which may be of importance regarding its pharmacological effects in vivo.",

    "title": "Efficacy of Tenofovir 1% Vaginal Gel in Reducing the Risk of HIV-1 and HSV-2 Infection.",
    "abstract": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that can result in rare opportunistic infections occurring in humans. The onset of these infections is known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Sexual transmission is responsible for the majority of infections 1, resulting in transmission of HIV due to infected semen or vaginal and cervical secretions containing infected lymphocytes. HIV microbicides are formulations of chemical or biological agents that can be applied to the vagina or rectum with the intention of reducing the acquisition of HIV. Tenofovir is an NRTI that is phosphorylated by adenylate kinase to tenofovir diphosphate, which in turn competes with deoxyadeosine 5'-triphosphate for incorporation into newly synthesized HIV DNA. Once incorporated, tenofovir diphosphate results in chain termination, thus inhibiting viral replication. Tenofovir has been formulated into a range of vaginal formulations, such as rings, tablets gels and films. It has been shown to safe and effective in numerous animal models, while demonstrating safety and acceptability in numerous human trials. The most encouraging results came from the CAPRISA 004 clinical trial which demonstrated that a 1% Tenofovir vaginal gel reduced HIV infection by approximately 39%.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews have found that luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists are effective in treating premenopausal women with early breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted long-term follow-up (median 12 years) of 2706 women in the Zoladex In Premenopausal Patients (ZIPP), which evaluated the LHRH agonist goserelin (3.6 mg injection every 4 weeks) and tamoxifen (20 or 40 mg daily), given for 2 years. Women were randomly assigned to receive each therapy alone, both, or neither, after primary therapy (surgery with or without radiotherapy/chemotherapy). Hazard ratios and absolute risk differences were used to assess the effect of goserelin treatment on event-free survival (breast cancer recurrence, new tumor or death), overall survival, risk of recurrence of breast cancer, and risk of dying from breast cancer, in the presence or absence of tamoxifen. RESULTS: Fifteen years after the initiation of treatment, for every 100 women not given tamoxifen, there were 13.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17.5 to 19.4) fewer events among those who were treated with goserelin compared with those who were not treated with goserelin. However, among women who did take tamoxifen, there were 2.8 fewer events (95% CI = 7.7 fewer to 2.0 more) per 100 women treated with goserelin compared with those not treated with goserelin. The risk of dying from breast cancer was also reduced at 15 years: For every 100 women given goserelin, the number of breast cancer deaths was lower by 2.6 (95% CI = 6.6 fewer to 2.1 more) and 8.5 (95% CI = 2.2 to 13.7) in those who did and did not take tamoxifen, respectively, although in the former group the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Two years of goserelin treatment was as effective as 2 years of tamoxifen treatment 15 years after starting therapy. In women who did not take tamoxifen, there was a large benefit of goserelin treatment on survival and recurrence, and in women who did take tamoxifen, there was a marginal potential benefit on these outcomes when goserelin was added.",

    "title": "Cannabis and cannabinoids: pharmacology and rationale for clinical use.",
    "abstract": "It is now known that there are at least two types of cannabinoid receptors. These are CB1 receptors, present mainly on central and peripheral neurones, and CB2 receptors, present mainly on immune cells. Endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists ('endocannabinoids') have also been identified. The discovery of this 'endogenous cannabinoid system' has led to the development of selective CB1 and CB2 receptor ligands and fueled renewed interest in the clinical potential of cannabinoids. Two cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonists are already used clinically, as antiemetics or as appetite stimulants. These are D 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and nabilone. Other possible uses for CB1 receptor agonists include the suppression of muscle spasm/spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, the relief of chronic pain and the management of glaucoma and bronchial asthma. CB1 receptor antagonists may also have clinical applications, e. g. as appetite suppressants and in the management of schizophrenia or disorders of cognition and memory. So too may CB2 receptor ligands and drugs that activate cannabinoid receptors indirectly by augmenting endocannabinoid levels at cannabinoid receptors. When taken orally, THC seems to undergo variable absorption and to have a narrow 'therapeutic window' (dose range in which it is effective without producing significant unwanted effects). This makes it difficult to predict an oral dose that will be both effective and tolerable to a patient and indicates a need for better cannabinoid formulations and modes of administration. For the therapeutic potential of cannabis or CB1 receptor agonists to be fully exploited, it will be important to establish objectively and conclusively (a) whether these agents have efficacy against selected symptoms that is of clinical significance and, if so, whether the benefits outweigh the risks, (b) whether cannabis has therapeutic advantages over individual cannabinoids, (c) whether there is a need for additional drug treatments to manage any of the disorders against which cannabinoids are effective, and (d) whether it will be possible to develop drugs that have reduced psychotropic activity and yet retain the ability to act through CB1 receptors to produce their sought-after effects.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of FR133605, a novel inhibitor of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), on bone and cartilage destruction in adjuvant arthritic rats and compared it to corticosteroid, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), and disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD). METHODS: The antiinflammatory responses were evaluated by measurement of hind paw swelling, body weight, femoral bone mineral density, and glycosaminoglycan content (GAG) in femoral condyles in adjuvant arthritic rats. RESULTS: FR133605 inhibited IL-1 and TNF-alpha production stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in human monocytes. FR133605 also inhibited serum IL-1 and TNF-alpha concentrations in LPS treated mice. In contrast, among comparison antirheumatic drugs, only corticosteroid inhibited production at nontoxic concentrations. In adjuvant arthritis, FR133605 significantly inhibited paw swelling, bone and cartilage destruction, and increased body weight. On the other hand, indomethacin significantly inhibited paw swelling, but not bone and cartilage loss. Dexamethasone completely inhibited paw swelling and bone loss, but augmented cartilage breakdown. DMARD weakly restored the loss of GAG contents in articular cartilage. CONCLUSIONS: FR133605 improved bone loss and articular cartilage destruction in adjuvant arthritic rats and the inhibitory effect was closely correlated with the suppressive activity of IL-1 and TNF-alpha production.",

    "title": "Involvement of vacuolar H+ -ATPase in incorporation of risedronate into osteoclasts.",
    "abstract": "Although osteoclasts incorporate bisphosphonates during bone resorption, the mechanism of this incorporation by osteoclasts is not known. We previously reported that bisphosphonates disrupt the actin rings (clear zones) formed in normal osteoclasts, but did not disrupt actin rings in osteoclasts derived from osteosclerotic oc/oc mice, which have a defect in the gene encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase). The present study showed that V-ATPase is directly involved in the incorporation of risedronate, a nitrogen containing bisphosphonate, into osteoclasts. Treatment of osteoclasts with risedronate disrupted actin rings and inhibited pit formation by osteoclasts on dentine slices. Bafilomycin A(1), a V-ATPase inhibitor, inhibited the pit-forming activity of osteoclasts but did not disrupt actin rings. Risedronate failed to disrupt actin rings in the presence of bafilomycin A(1). E-64, a lysosomal cysteine proteinase inhibitor, showed no inhibitory effect on the demineralization of dentine by osteoclasts but inhibited the digestion of dentine matrix proteins without disrupting actin rings. Risedronate disrupted actin rings even in the presence of E-64. Treatment of osteoclasts placed on plastic plates with risedronate also disrupted actin rings. Bafilomycin A(1) but not E64 prevented the disruption of actin rings in osteoclasts treated with risedronate on plastic plates. Inhibition of V-ATPase with bafilomycin A(1) also prevented disruption of actin rings by etidronate, a non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate. These results suggest that V-ATPase induced acidification beneath the ruffled borders of osteoclasts and subsequent bone demineralization triggers the incorporation of both nitrogen-containing and non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates into osteoclasts.",

    "abstract": "Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain is principally mediated by the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and its synaptic target, the type A GABA receptor (GABAA receptor). Dysfunction of this receptor results in neurological disorders and mental illnesses including epilepsy, anxiety and insomnia.

Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human alpha1beta2gamma2 GABAA receptor, the predominant isoform in the adult brain, in complex with GABA and the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil, the first-line clinical treatment for benzodiazepine overdose. The receptor architecture reveals unique heteromeric interactions for this important class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor. This work provides a template for understanding receptor modulation by GABA and benzodiazepines, and will assist rational approaches to therapeutic targeting of this receptor for neurological disorders and mental illness.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) the precursor of noradrenaline (NA) has been shown to have many functions such as its influence on endorphins activity and its association with hedonic impact, anxiety and depression. However with regard to the sympathetic nervous system activity, the role of DA has merely been considered as being the precursor of NA. We have shown in a previous study a positive correlation between the resting plasma level of NA and those found during exposure to a physical stress. No explanation was proposed to explain this finding. Enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity has been shown to increase the secretion of NA as well as DA. It is not known however if the secretion of DA during exposure to stress parallels that of NA. What are the interactions between the two amines and also between values at rest and during exposure to stress? For that reason a test was used which consisted of blowing cold wind (4 degrees C at 60 km/h) on the face of a group of subjects and measuring plasma concentration of the two amines before, during and after the test. For a given individual, the increase of either plasma NA or DA in response to the cold wind stress parallels the resting plasma concentrations of these two amines respectively. Low level of one amine at rest coincides with low increase during the stress. Furthermore the results have shown that when the plasma level of either one of these two amines is high in response to stress, the values of the other amine are small; both amines are not high or low at the same time. The literature suggests that dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH), the enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of NA from DA, may provide an explanation to our findings. Lower DBH activity of this enzyme would result in a lower NA and a greater DA storage and secretion. Further investigation is needed to verify this possibility.",

These enzymes covalently modify the N-terminal lysine residues of histones by the addition of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA. Dysfunction of these enzymes is often associated with the manifestation of several diseases, predominantly cancer. Here we report that anacardic acid from cashew nut shell liquid is a potent inhibitor of p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor histone acetyltranferase activities. Although it does not affect DNA transcription, HAT-dependent transcription from a chromatin template was strongly inhibited by anacardic acid. Furthermore, we describe the design and synthesis of an amide derivative N-(4-chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-2-ethoxy-6-pentadecyl-benzamide (CTPB) using anacardic acid as a synthon, which remarkably activates p300 HAT activity but not that of p300/CBP-associated factor. Although CTPB does not affect DNA transcription, it enhances the p300 HAT-dependent transcriptional activation from in vitro assembled chromatin template. However, it has no effect on histone deacetylase activity. These compounds would be useful as biological switching molecules for probing into the role of p300 in transcriptional studies and may also be useful as new chemical entities for the development of anticancer drugs.",

Procainamide has been shown to inhibit DNA methyltransferase activity and reactivate silenced gene expression in cancer cells by reversing CpG island hypermethylation. We report here that procainamide specifically inhibits the hemimethylase activity of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the mammalian enzyme thought to be responsible for maintaining DNA methylation patterns during replication. At micromolar concentrations, procainamide was found to be a partial competitive inhibitor of DNMT1, reducing the affinity of the enzyme for its two substrates, hemimethylated DNA and S-adenosyl-l-methionine. By doing so, procainamide significantly decreased the processivity of DNMT1 on hemimethylated DNA. Procainamide was not a potent inhibitor of the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b2. As further evidence of the specificity of procainamide for DNMT1, procainamide failed to lower genomic 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine levels in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells when DNMT1 was genetically deleted but significantly reduced genomic 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine content in parental HCT116 cells and in HCT116 cells where DNMT3b was genetically deleted. Because many reports have strongly linked DNMT1 with epigenetic alterations in carcinogenesis, procainamide may be a useful drug in the prevention of cancer.",

Furthermore, coagulation Factor VIII and activated Factor IX (Factor IXa) have been identified as proteins that are able to bind to LRP. In the present review, the potential contribution of LRP to the regulation of the coagulation cascade through these novel pathways is discussed, with particular reference to the interaction between LRP and coagulation Factor VIII.",

    "abstract": "Most clinically used opioids are thought to induce analgesia through activation of the mu opioid receptor (MOR). However, disparities have been observed between the efficacy of opioids in activating the MOR in vitro and in inducing analgesia in vivo. In addition, some clinically used opioids do not produce cross-tolerance with each other, and desensitization produced in vitro does not match tolerance produced in vivo. These disparities suggest that some opioids could be acting through other targets in vivo, but this has not been comprehensively tested. We thus screened 9 clinically relevant opioids (buprenorphine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, O-desmethyl-tramadol, oxycodone, oxymorphone, tapentadol, tramadol) against 9 pain-related receptor targets (MOR, delta opioid receptor [DOR], kappa opioid receptor [KOR], nociceptin receptor [NOP], cannabinoid receptor type 1 [CB1], sigma-1 receptor [sigma1R], and the monoamine transporters [NET/SERT/DAT]) expressed in cells using radioligand binding and functional activity assays. We found several novel interactions, including monoamine transporter activation by buprenorphine and sigma1R binding by hydrocodone and tapentadol. Tail flick anti-nociception experiments with CD-1 mice demonstrated that the monoamine transporter inhibitor duloxetine selectively promoted buprenorphine anti-nociception while producing no effects by itself or in combination with the most MOR-selective drug oxymorphone, providing evidence that these novel interactions could be relevant in vivo. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the receptor interaction profiles of clinically relevant opioids, which has not previously been performed. Our findings also suggest novel receptor interactions for future investigation that could explain some of the disparities observed between opioid performance in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Estrogen-related receptor (ERR) alpha-1 shares a high amino acid sequence homology with estrogen receptor alpha. Although estrogens are not ligands of ERR alpha-1, our recent results suggest that toxaphene and chlordane, two organochlorine pesticides with estrogen-like activity, behave as antagonists for this orphan nuclear receptor. The two compounds increased ERR alpha-1-mediated expression of the reporter enzyme beta-galactosidase in a yeast-based assay. The screen was developed by expressing the hERR alpha-1-yeast Gal 4 activation domain fusion protein in yeast cells carrying the beta-galactosidase reporter plasmid, which contains an ERR alpha-1-binding element. In transfection experiments using mammalian cell lines, such as the SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell line, the compounds were found to have an antagonist activity against ERR alpha-1-mediated expression of the reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. In contrast to the findings with ERR alpha-1, the two compounds were found to slightly induce the estrogen receptor a-mediated expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in SK-BR-3 cells. In a ligand-independent manner, the ERR alpha-1 activity in SK-BR-3 cells was induced 3-fold by cotransfection with the GRIP1 coactivator expression plasmid. Toxaphene was found to be capable of suppressing the GRIP1 coactivator-induced ERR alpha-1 activity in SK-BR-3 cells. In addition, a stable ERR alpha-1 expressing HepG2 hepatoma cell line was generated, and the aromatase activity in the transfected cell line was found to be twice that in the untransfected cell line. The enzyme aromatase converts androgens to estrogens, and aromatase expression in HepG2 cells is regulated in part by an ERR alpha-1-modulating promoter. A 24-h incubation of an ERR alpha-1-transfected HepG2 cell line with 10 microM toxaphene reduced its aromatase activity to the level in the untransfected cell line. Because toxaphene is not an inhibitor of aromatase, it is thought that the decrease of the aromatase activity in ERR alpha-1 transfected HepG2 cells following toxaphene treatment resulted from a suppression of the aromatase expression by toxaphene acting as the antagonist of ERR alpha-1. Toxaphene and chlordane are among the 12 persistent organic pollutants identified by the United Nations Environment Programme as requiring urgent attention. Their antagonistic effects on ERR alpha-1 should not be overlooked.",

In order to assess the effects of antalarmin treatment on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function we measured the plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone in animals treated with either antalarmin or vehicle for 1 week or for 8 weeks. We found that antalarmin treatment for 1 week did not affect basal concentrations of ACTH or corticosterone. In contrast, treatment for 8 weeks significantly lowered basal ACTH and corticosterone concentrations and also significantly decreased the basal corticosterone to ACTH ratio, indicating decreased basal adrenocortical responsiveness to ACTH. However, immobilization stress resulted in ACTH and corticosterone concentrations that were the same in animals treated with vehicle or antalarmin for either 1 or 8 weeks. We conclude that even though 8-week antagonism of CRHR1 by the non-peptide antalarmin blunts basal concentrations of ACTH and corticosterone, and affects the adrenal responsiveness to ACTH, it does not blunt the HPA response to acute stress, and it does not appear to cause stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.",

Progestins are compounds that demonstrate progesterone-like activity and are used in oral contraception, hormone therapy, and treatment of some reproductive disorders, but differ widely in their chemical structures, potency, and pharmacokinetics. While numerous studies have assessed progestins on specific endpoints, little is known about the activation of global gene expression by progestins. We used Affymetrix GeneChip U133A expression arrays to examine the action of P4 and six clinically relevant synthetic progestins (3-ketodesogestrel, drospirenone, levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone acetate, and trimegestone) on the progesterone receptor (PR)-positive T47Dco and the PR-negative T47D-Y breast cancer cell lines. Excluding drospirenone, one or more of the progestins-regulated 329 genes, with 30 genes regulated by at least 2.0-fold by all progestins in the T47Dco cells. The synthetic progestins show a high degree of similarity in their transcriptional responses, and each progestin regulates between 77 and 91% of the genes regulated by P4. Independent quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed a similar regulation for S100P, PPL, IL20RA, NET1, ATP1A1, HIG2, and CXCL12 (SDF-1) by all seven progestins. Attempts to find differentially regulated genes by any progestin compared to all other treatments failed, suggesting any differences are quantitative, not qualitative. This analysis demonstrates a high degree of similarity among these progestins on PR-regulated gene expression in T47D cells, suggesting a similar and fairly specific mode of action.",

    "abstract": "Cerulenin is a fungal mycotoxin that potently inhibits fatty acid synthesis by covalent modification of the active site thiol of the chain-elongation subtypes of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthases. The Bacillus subtilis fabF (yjaY) gene (fabF(b)) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-ACP with acyl-ACP to extend the growing acyl chain by two carbons. There were two mechanisms by which B. subtilis adapted to exposure to this antibiotic. First, reporter gene analysis demonstrated that transcription of the operon containing the fabF gene increased eightfold in response to a cerulenin challenge. This response was selective for the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis, since triclosan, an inhibitor of enoyl-ACP reductase, triggered an increase in fabF reporter gene expression while nalidixic acid did not. Second, spontaneous mutants arose that exhibited a 10-fold increase in the MIC of cerulenin. The mutation mapped at the B. subtilis fabF locus, and sequence analysis of the mutant fabF allele showed that a single base change resulted in the synthesis of FabF(b)[I108F]. The purified FabF(b) and FabF(b)[I108F] proteins had similar specific activities with myristoyl-ACP as the substrate. FabF(b) exhibited a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of cerulenin of 0.1 microM, whereas the IC(50) for FabF(b)[I108] was 50-fold higher (5 microM). These biochemical data explain the absence of an overt growth defect coupled with the cerulenin resistance phenotype of the mutant strain.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of the hair cycle takes place at the pilo-sebaceous unit with the sebaceous gland as a sex hormone-dependent part. Although minoxidil stimulates proliferation of follicular cells and activation of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1, it was suggested that other mechanisms, such as an increase in the local blood flow, might mediate the drug effect on hair growth. If that is the case, it is possible that minoxidil counteracts some vasoconstrictive mediator of male-pattern alopecia. This hypothetical vasoconstrictive mediator X would have to meet some criteria: (I) vasoconstriction both in the general circulation and in the hair-growing skin; (II) local vasoconstrictive activity in the hair growing skin should be related to the circulating testosterone level; (III) only an increase in the local mediator X activity causes male-pattern alopecia, since hypertensive patients are not balder than expected. The sebaceous gland is a possible place of the mediator X secretion since it is a sex-hormone-dependent part of the pilo-sebaceous unit. ET-1 might be a suitable candidate for the mediator X, since male hormones raise ET-1 plasma levels and female hormones lower them. The speculation presented here is that ET-1, beside vasoconstriction in the general circulation, might also regulate the sebum secretion, by triggering contractions of the myoepithelial cells. This hypothetical mechanism would normally remain confined to the sebaceous gland. During puberty, sex hormones stimulate growth of sebaceous glands in both sexes. In women hypertrophied sebaceous glands under estrogen control would not increase its ET-1 content, while in men, testosterone would increase ET-1 secretion that might affect the neighboring arterioles. Induced vasoconstriction might reduce the hair growth and promote hair loss. If ET-1 plays the described role, then an ET-1 antagonist, i.e. bosentane, should also have some hair-growing properties.",

In vitro and in vivo assays were developed for the evaluation of a novel 5-LOX inhibitor using conditions of maximal enzyme activity. PF-4191834 exhibits good potency in enzyme- and cell-based assays, as well as in a rat model of acute inflammation. Enzyme assay results indicate that PF-4191834 is a potent 5-LOX inhibitor, with an IC(50) = 229 +/- 20 nM. Furthermore, it demonstrated approximately 300-fold selectivity for 5-LOX over 12-LOX and 15-LOX and shows no activity toward the cyclooxygenase enzymes. In addition, PF-4191834 inhibits 5-LOX in human blood cells, with an IC(80) = 370 +/- 20 nM. This inhibitory concentration correlates well with plasma exposures needed for in vivo efficacy in inflammation in models of inflammatory pain.

Single oral doses of MK-5046 inhibited 2-h and overnight food intake and increased fasting metabolic rate in wild-type but not Brs3 knockout mice. Upon dosing for 14 days, MK-5046 at 25 mg   kg(-1)   day(-1) reduced body weight of diet-induced obese mouse by 9% compared with vehicle-dosed controls. In mice, 50% brain receptor occupancy was achieved at a plasma concentration of 0.34 +- 0.23 muM. With chronic dosing, effects on metabolic rate, rather than food intake, seem to be the predominant mechanism for weight reduction by MK-5046. The compound also effectively reduced body weight in rats and caused modest increases in body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. These latter effects on temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure were transient in nature and desensitized with continued dosing. MK-5046 is the first BRS-3 agonist with properties suitable for use in larger mammals. In dogs, MK-5046 treatment produced statistically significant and persistent weight loss, which was initially accompanied by increases in body temperature and heart rate that abated with continued dosing. Our results demonstrate antiobesity efficacy for MK-5046 in rodents and dogs and further support BRS-3 agonism as a new approach to the treatment of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Macrophage Fcgamma receptors have an important role in host defense and the pathophysiology of immune mediated disorders. Alteration of splenic macrophage Fcgamma receptors expression predisposes to severe infection. Inhibition or blockade of splenic macrophage Fcgamma receptors is one of the mechanisms by which immune cytopenias improve. Dopaminergic drugs have clinically significant regulatory functions on the immune response. Using an experimental model in the guinea pig we assessed the effect of commonly used dopaminergic drugs on the expression of macrophage Fcgamma receptors. Three dopa-antagonists, bromocryptine, leuprolide, and pergolide, and seven dopa-antagonists, chlorpromazine, SCH 23390, metochlopramide, sulpiride, veralipride, alizapride, and cisapride, were studied. Following guinea pig treatment with dopaminergic drugs, the clearance of IgG-sensitized RBCs in vivo, the in vitro binding of IgG-sensitized RBCs by isolated splenic macrophages and flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies were performed. Treatment with dopa-agonists enhanced the clearance of IgG-sensitized RBCs, the in vitro binding of IgG-sensitized RBCs by isolated splenic macrophages, and the cell surface expression of both macrophage Fcgamma receptors, and vice versa, dopa-antagonists impaired macrophage Fcgamma receptors expression. Macrophage FcgammaR1,2 was more sensitive than FcgammaR2 to such dopaminergic effect. These alterations of macrophage Fcgamma receptors expression are mediated by both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors, with a major participation of D2 receptors. Dopaminergic drugs alter the clearance of IgG-coated cells by an effect at the expression of splenic macrophage Fcgamma receptors.",

A microdilution broth assay established that the MIC of TMP for B. anthracis Sterne is &gt;2,048 but &lt; or =4,096 microg/ml. A putative DHFR sequence was amplified from B. anthracis Sterne genomic DNA. The PCR product was cloned into the Invitrogen pCRT7/CT-TOPO vector, followed by transformation into Escherichia coli TOP10F' chemically competent cells. Plasmid DNA from a clone showing the correct construct with a thrombin cleavage site attached downstream from the terminus of the cloned PCR product was transformed into E. coli BL21 Star (DE3)pLysS competent cells for expression of the six-histidine-tagged fusion protein and purification on a His-Bind resin column. Functionality of the purified Sterne recombinant DHFR (Sterne rDHFR) was confirmed in an established enzyme assay. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of TMP and methotrexate for the Sterne rDHFR were found to be 77,233 and 12.2 nM, respectively. TMP resistance was observed with E. coli BL21 Star (DE3)pLysS competent cells transformed with the Sterne DHFR gene. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the Sterne DHFR gene revealed 100% homology with various virulent strains of B. anthracis. These results confirm the natural resistance of B. anthracis to TMP and clarify that the resistance is correlated to a lack of selectivity for the chromosomally encoded gene product. These findings will assist in the development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents for treatment of anthrax.",

The ability of BILD 1351 SE to inhibit the replication of HSV-1 when used in combination with acyclovir (ACV) for the treatment of HSV infections was investigated in baby hamster kidney cells using a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effective concentrations to achieve 50% inhibition (EC50) of virus replication by BILD 1351 SE in serum-starved and non serum-starved cells were 2 +/- 0.9 and 4.1 + 1.6 microM, respectively. The EC50 of ACV under both assay conditions was equal to 2.7 +/- 0.9 microM when tested alone. However, upon addition of BILD 1351 SE, the antiviral activity of ACV was potentiated in a synergistic manner as determined by the isobole method. At a concentration of BILD 1351 SE that produced 30% inhibition of HSV-1 replication, the EC50 of ACV decreased by about 15-fold in confluent cells and 17-fold in serum-starved cells. Similar conclusions were reached when evaluating drug interactions by the median dose-effect. Assuming mutually non-exclusive conditions at a drug ratio of ACV/BILD 1351 SE of 1/2, synergy was demonstrated in confluent cells with a drug enhancement index at EC50 of 14 and a combination index of 0.25. None of the drug combinations tested showed increased cytotoxicity in comparison with each drug alone. These results are consistent with the expected mode of action of a selective HSV RR inhibitor and support the strategy of combining these inhibitors with ACV for improved therapy of HSV infections.",

On the sequence of our previous work on methotrexate (MTX) derivatives, we have developed and evaluated novel MTX analogues, containing a pteridine moiety conjugated with benzenesulfonamide derivatives, thus endowed with the potential capacity for dual inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and carbonic anhydrases (CA).

Their simultaneous inhibition may turn beneficial in terms of enhanced antitumor activity. Herein we report the design and synthesis of several diaminopteridine-benzenesulfonamide and -benzenesulfonate conjugates, differing in the nature and size of the spacer group between the two key moieties. The inhibition studies performed on a set of CAs and DHFR, revealed the activities in the low nanomolar and low micromolar ranges of concentration, respectively. Some inhibitors showed selectivity for the tumor-related CA (isozyme IX). Cell proliferation assays using two tumor cell lines (the non-small cell lung carcinoma, A549, and prostate carcinoma, PC-3) showed activities only in the millimolar range. Nevertheless, this fact points out the need of improving the cell intake properties of these new compounds, since the general inhibitory profiles revealed their potential as anticancer agents.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Recent studies indicate that mu opioids are generally more potent and effective as antinociceptive agents in male than female rodents. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of sex on the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine and cross-tolerance to the lower efficacy mu opioids buprenorphine and dezocine in F344 and Lewis rats. METHODS: Using a warm-water tail-withdrawal procedure, the antinociceptive effects of morphine, buprenorphine and dezocine were determined before and during chronic morphine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, b.i.d., for 7 and 14 days) administration. RESULTS: Under acute conditions, morphine was more potent in males and during chronic morphine administration tolerance development was generally greater in males. As males were more sensitive to the acute effects of morphine, the functional chronic morphine dose (i.e., chronic morphine dose/acute morphine ED50) administered to males was larger than in females. Analyses of the relationship between the functional chronic morphine dose and tolerance indicated that morphine tolerance development was comparable in males and females. Under acute conditions, buprenorphine and dezocine were more potent and effective in males. During chronic morphine administration, cross-tolerance was conferred to these opioids as evidenced by rightward, and in some cases downward, shifts in their dose-effect curves. Decreases in the maximal effects produced by buprenorphine and dezocine were more frequently observed in females. CONCLUSIONS: That comparable levels of morphine tolerance were obtained in males and females when the functional chronic morphine dose was taken into consideration suggests that the mechanism underlying tolerance is not sex-dependent. Sex differences in the effectiveness of buprenorphine and dezocine when administered acutely and during chronic morphine administration further suggest that these opioids have lower efficacy at the mu opioid receptor in females.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In patients with severe hemophilia A, standard treatment is regular prophylactic and episodic intravenous infusions of factor VIII. However, these treatments are burdensome, especially for children, and may lead to the formation of anti-factor VIII alloantibodies (factor VIII inhibitors). Emicizumab (ACE910), a humanized bispecific antibody mimicking the cofactor function of factor VIII, was developed to abate these problems. METHODS: We enrolled 18 Japanese patients with severe hemophilia A (with or without factor VIII inhibitors) in an open-label, nonrandomized, interindividual dose-escalation study of emicizumab. The patients received subcutaneous emicizumab weekly for 12 weeks at a dose of 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg per kilogram of body weight (cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The end points were safety and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. An additional, exploratory end point was the annualized bleeding rate, calculated as 365.25 times the number of bleeding episodes, divided by the number of days in the treatment period as compared with the 6 months before enrollment. RESULTS: Emicizumab was associated with neither serious adverse events nor clinically relevant coagulation abnormalities. Plasma concentrations of emicizumab increased in a dose-dependent manner. Activated partial-thromboplastin times remained short throughout the study. The median annualized bleeding rates in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 decreased from 32.5 to 4.4, 18.3 to 0.0, and 15.2 to 0.0, respectively. There was no bleeding in 8 of 11 patients with factor VIII inhibitors (73%) and in 5 of 7 patients without factor VIII inhibitors (71%). Episodic use of clotting factors to control bleeding was reduced. Antibodies to emicizumab did not develop. CONCLUSIONS: Once-weekly subcutaneous administration of emicizumab markedly decreased the bleeding rate in patients who had hemophilia A with or without factor VIII inhibitors.

More recent evidence indicates that mAChR activators might also have utility in treating psychosis and other symptoms associated with schizophrenia and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Efforts to develop mAChR subtype-selective agonists have been hampered by difficulty in achieving high selectivity for individual mAChR subtypes important for CNS function (M(1) and M(4)) and adverse effects due to activation of peripheral mAChRs (especially M(2) and M(3)). Major advances have now been achieved in the discovery of allosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators of M(1) and M(4) that show greater selectivity for individual mAChR subtypes than do previous mAChR agonists. Early studies indicate that these allosteric mAChR activators have properties needed for optimization as potential clinical candidates and have robust effects in animal models that predict efficacy in the treatment of AD, schizophrenia and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone, Copolymer 1) is an approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and is highly effective in the suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in various species. The mode of action of GA is by initial strong promiscuous binding to MHC molecules and consequent competition with various myelin antigens for their presentation to T cells. A further aspect of its action is potent induction of specific suppressor cells of the T helper 2 (Th2) type that migrate to the brain and lead to in situ bystander suppression. Furthermore, the GA-specific cells in the brain express the antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta, in addition to brain-derived neurotrophic factor, whereas they do not express IFN-gamma. Based on this immunomodulatory mode of action, we explored the potential of GA for two other applications: prevention of graft rejection and amelioration of inflammatory bowel diseases. GA was effective in amelioration of graft rejection in two systems by prolongation of skin graft survival and inhibition of functional deterioration of thyroid grafts, across minor and major histocompatibility barriers. In all transplantation systems GA treatment inhibited the detrimental secretion of Th1 inflammatory cytokines and induced beneficial Th2/3 antiinflammatory response. GA was effective also in combination with low-dose immunosuppressive drugs. Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by detrimental imbalanced proinflammatory immune reactivity in the gut. GA significantly suppressed the various manifestations of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, including mortality, weight loss, and macroscopic and microscopic colonic damage. GA suppressed local lymphocyte proliferations and tumor necrosis factor alpha detrimental secretion but induced transforming growth factor beta, thus confirming the involvement of Th1 to Th2 shift in GA mode of action.",

    "abstract": "Suggestion of a role for protein phosphorylation in the regulation of intestinal active NaCl transport was found by studying the effects of low concentrations of promethazine on Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein phosphorylation of ileal microvillus membranes and on active ileal electrolyte transport. Ca2+-CaM increased the phosphorylation of six microvillus peptides (Mr 137,000, 116,000, 77,000, 58,000, 53,000, and 50,000) in a concentration-dependent manner. Promethazine inhibited the Ca2+-CaM-induced increases in each of these phosphorylations. The effect of promethazine was concentration dependent, with concentrations of 5-12 microM (mean 8 microM) causing 50% inhibition. Promethazine also caused a concentration-dependent increase in net Cl absorption and decrease in the ileal short-circuit current, with 9 microM promethazine causing a change in short-circuit current 50% of maximum. The promethazine effect on microvillus membrane phosphorylation was specific, since neither cAMP- and cGMP-induced phosphorylation in the microvillus membrane nor the stimulation by Ca2+-CaM of myosin light chain kinase phosphorylation of myosin light chain were affected by promethazine. The similar, and unusual sensitivity to low concentrations of promethazine on ileal microvillus membrane phosphorylation increased by Ca2+-CaM and on ileal electrolyte transport is consistent with Ca2+-CaM-dependent microvillus membrane phosphorylation being involved in the regulation of active electrolyte transport in ileal absorptive cells.",

    "abstract": "Structure-activity relationships for inhibition of erbB1, erbB2, and erbB4 were determined for a series of alkynamide analogues of quinazoline- and pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine-based compounds. The compounds were prepared by coupling the appropriate 6-aminoquinazolines or 6-aminopyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidines with alkynoic acids, using EDCI.HCl in pyridine. The compounds showed pan-erbB enzyme inhibition but were on average about 10-fold more potent against erbB1 than against erbB2 and erbB4. For cellular inhibition, the nature of the alkylating side chains was an important determinant, with 5-dialkylamino-2-pentynamide type Michael acceptors providing the highest potency. This is suggested to be due to an improved ability of the amine to participate in an autocatalysis of the Michael reaction with enzyme cysteine residues. Pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine analogue 39 was selected for in vivo evaluation and achieved tumor regressions at 10 mg/kg in the A431 human epidermoid carcinoma and at 40 mg/kg for the SF767 human glioblastoma and the SKOV3 human ovarian carcinoma.

    "abstract": "The hypothesis that endotoxemia may modify histamine synthesis or histamine receptor expression and that these changes may contribute to cardiovascular dysfunction was tested in rabbits which were rendered endotoxemic by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 micro g/kg, i.v.). The plasma histamine concentration was elevated shortly after LPS, remaining elevated (a 50-fold increase) over the experimental period of 6 h. The sustained increase in plasma histamine was associated with a time-dependent increase in expression of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) in different tissues including atrium, as determined by Western blot analysis. The H(1)-receptor antagonist diphenhydramine significantly shortened the duration of the initial hypotension and the H(2)-receptor antagonist ranitidine greatly suppressed the lasting tachycardia following LPS injection. Northern blot analysis showed that LPS dramatically induced gene expressions of histamine H(1)- and H(2)-receptors in cardiac tissues. In right atrium isolated from the septic animal, the positive chronotropic effect of histamine was significantly diminished. This was possibly due to a marked reduction in G(s)(alpha) protein expression, indicating the impaired H(2)-receptor cellular signaling. In conclusion, LPS-induced endotoxemia causes prominent increases in production of histamine through induction of HDC and in gene expression of histamine receptors. We suggest that overproduction of histamine may be partly responsible for the hemodynamic alterations of endotoxemia.",

In the present study, we investigated the effects of propofol and thiamylal on sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels activities induced by nicorandil in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. METHODS: We used inside-out patch clamp configurations to investigate the effects of propofol and thiamylal on nicorandil induced K(ATP) channel activities. RESULTS: K(ATP) channel was not spontaneously activated by patch excision in the absence of intracellular ATP. Application of nicorandil (100 microM) induced a marked activation of KATP channel currents, which was completely blocked by 3 microM glibenclamide, the sulfonylurea that blocks K(ATP) channels. Nicorandil induced KATP channel currents were not significantly inhibited by application of 10 and 100 microM propofol to intracellular surface. However, application of 100 and 300 microM thiamylal to intracellular surface significantly inhibited the nicorandil induced K(ATP) channel currents, with relative channel activities decreasing to 0.65 +/- 0.08 and 0.46 +/- 0.10 of control, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol had no effect on nicorandil induced sarcolemmal KATP channel activities in rat aortic smooth muscle cells, whereas thiamylal significantly inhibited these channel activities at clinically relevant concentrations.",

The nucleotide analogs 5'-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IdU) and 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) were used; these are incorporated into DNA, impairing its function, and have amnestic actions in defined models of learning in mice. We studied the effects of 5'-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine of the formation of long-term memory in chicks during training in different models: passive avoidance, imprinting, taste aversion, and spatial learning in a maze. In the taste aversion model, i.p. administration of IdU (10 mg/kg 5 min before or 50 min after training) had an amnestic effect on testing 1-2 days after training. IdU-induced amnesia developed more than 6 h after training, while administration of IdU 2 h after training had no amnestic effect. 5'-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine also had a similar amnestic action in the taste aversion model. In the passive avoidance, imprinting, and spatial maze learning models, administration of IdU at the same dose before and after training did not induce amnesia. These data lead to the suggestion that DNA synthesis in the brain may play a critical role in the mechanisms of memory consolidation in chicks in types of learning such as taste aversion.",

METHODS: BISTRO I patients received oral dabigatran etexilate postsurgery for 6-10 days. Dabigatran plasma concentrations and aPTT/ECT were measured on the day of surgery, on subsequent days and at steady state. PK-PD characteristics of the dabigatran-aPTT/ECT relationships were evaluated using NONMEM V. RESULTS: The dabigatran concentration-aPTT relationship was described combining a linear and an E(max) model. Mean baseline aPTT was 33.4 s and E(max) (maximum increase in aPTT contributed by the E(max) model) was 26.9 s. The dabigatran concentration needed to attain 50% of maximum effect (EC(50)) was 94.7 ng ml(-1) and the mean slope of the linear concentration-response relationship (SLOP) was 0.0509 s ng(-1) ml(-1). Baseline aPTT and E(max) were highest following surgery and declined with time. The dabigatran concentration-ECT relationship fitted a linear model. Mean baseline ECT was 28 s and decreased with time; 50% of the maximum effect was observed after 2.9 days. SLOP decreased from 0.38 to 0.27 s ng(-1) ml(-1) with a half-life of 1.1 day, indicating greater PD effects on the day of surgery. Interindividual and residual variability was low. Covariates could not explain variability of this model. CONCLUSIONS: aPTT and ECT prolongation were directly correlated with dabigatran concentrations. Blood coagulation prolongation was most pronounced following surgery. Data suggest that ECT provides a more precise description of the anticoagulant effect than aPTT.",

    "title": "Adiponectin--a key adipokine in the metabolic syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Adiponectin is a recently described adipokine that has been recognized as a key regulator of insulin sensitivity and tissue inflammation. It is produced by adipose tissue (white and brown) and circulates in the blood at very high concentrations. It has direct actions in liver, skeletal muscle and the vasculature, with prominent roles to improve hepatic insulin sensitivity, increase fuel oxidation [via up-regulation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity] and decrease vascular inflammation. Adiponectin exists in the circulation as varying molecular weight forms, produced by multimerization. Recent data indicate that the high-molecular weight (HMW) complexes have the predominant action in the liver. In contrast to other adipokines, adiponectin secretion and circulating levels are inversely proportional to body fat content. Levels are further reduced in subjects with diabetes and coronary artery disease. Adiponectin antagonizes many effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) and this, in turn, suppresses adiponectin production. Furthermore, adiponectin secretion from adipocytes is enhanced by thiazolidinediones (which also act to antagonize TNF-alpha effects). Thus, adiponectin may be the common mechanism by which TNF-alpha promotes, and the thiazolidinediones suppress, insulin resistance and inflammation. Two adiponectin receptors, termed AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, have been identified and these are ubiquitously expressed. AdipoR1 is most highly expressed in skeletal muscle and has a prominent action to activate AMPK, and hence promote lipid oxidation. AdipoR2 is most highly expressed in liver, where it enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces steatosis via activation of AMPK and increased peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha ligand activity. T-cadherin, which is expressed in endothelium and smooth muscle, has been identified as an adiponectin-binding protein with preference for HMW adiponectin multimers. Given the low levels of adiponectin in subjects with the metabolic syndrome, and the beneficial effect of the adipokine in animal studies, there is exciting potential for adiponectin replacement therapy in insulin resistance and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "ST-246 is a low-molecular-weight compound (molecular weight = 376), that is potent (concentration that inhibited virus replication by 50% = 0.010 microM), selective (concentration of compound that inhibited cell viability by 50% = &gt;40 microM), and active against multiple orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia, monkeypox, camelpox, cowpox, ectromelia (mousepox), and variola viruses. Cowpox virus variants selected in cell culture for resistance to ST-246 were found to have a single amino acid change in the V061 gene. Reengineering this change back into the wild-type cowpox virus genome conferred resistance to ST-246, suggesting that V061 is the target of ST-246 antiviral activity. The cowpox virus V061 gene is homologous to vaccinia virus F13L, which encodes a major envelope protein (p37) required for production of extracellular virus. In cell culture, ST-246 inhibited plaque formation and virus-induced cytopathic effects. In single-cycle growth assays, ST-246 reduced extracellular virus formation by 10 fold relative to untreated controls, while having little effect on the production of intracellular virus. In vivo oral administration of ST-246 protected BALB/c mice from lethal infection, following intranasal inoculation with 10x 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of vaccinia virus strain IHD-J. ST-246-treated mice that survived infection acquired protective immunity and were resistant to subsequent challenge with a lethal dose (10x LD(50)) of vaccinia virus. Orally administered ST-246 also protected A/NCr mice from lethal infection, following intranasal inoculation with 40,000x LD(50) of ectromelia virus. Infectious virus titers at day 8 postinfection in liver, spleen, and lung from ST-246-treated animals were below the limits of detection (&lt;10 PFU/ml). In contrast, mean virus titers in liver, spleen, and lung tissues from placebo-treated mice were 6.2 x 10(7), 5.2 x 10(7), and 1.8 x 10(5) PFU/ml, respectively. Finally, oral administration of ST-246 inhibited vaccinia virus-induced tail lesions in Naval Medical Research Institute mice inoculated via the tail vein. Taken together, these results validate F13L as an antiviral target and demonstrate that an inhibitor of extracellular virus formation can protect mice from orthopoxvirus-induced disease.",

This finding provided the first evidence for the direct phosphate-phosphate interaction between the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and the substrate alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate in the phosphorylase catalytic reaction (Takagi, M., Fukui, T., and Shimomura, S. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 3716-3719). We have examined whether pyridoxal(5')triphospho(1)-alpha-D-glucose can act in a similar manner to the diphospho compound or not. In the absence of glucan the enzyme-bound triphospho compound was stable for 1 day at pH 6-9. In the presence of glucan, however, its glucosidic linkage was cleaved, and the glucosyl moiety liberated was transferred to glycogen with the formation of a new alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkage. Allosteric activator AMP accelerated the reaction and allosteric inhibitor glucose 6-phosphate showed the reverse effect. The pH optimum of the reaction was pH 8.1-8.4. Mg2+ slightly but significantly accelerated the reaction, whereas Mn2+ and Ca2+ inhibited the reaction. These results indicate that the glucosyltransfer from the triphospho compound occurs in an identical manner to that from the diphospho compound. Based on the present and previous data, we discuss the catalytic mechanism of phosphorylase, especially in comparison with that of phosphoryltransferases.",

Previously the mammalian SPT was described as a heterodimer composed of two subunits, SPTLC1 and SPTLC2. Recently we identified a novel third SPT subunit (SPTLC3). SPTLC3 shows about 68% identity to SPTLC2 and also includes a pyridoxal phosphate consensus motif. Here we report that the overexpression of SPTLC3 in HEK293 cells leads to the formation of two new sphingoid base metabolites, namely C(16)-sphinganine and C(16)-sphingosine. SPTLC3-expressing cells have higher in vitro SPT activities with lauryl- and myristoyl-CoA than SPTLC2-expressing cells, and SPTLC3 mRNA expression levels correlate closely with the C(16)-sphinganine synthesis rates in various human and murine cell lines. Approximately 15% of the total sphingolipids in human plasma contain a C(16) backbone and are found in the high density and low density but not the very low density lipoprotein fraction. In conclusion, we show that the SPTLC3 subunit generates C(16)-sphingoid bases and that sphingolipids with a C(16) backbone constitute a significant proportion of human plasma sphingolipids.",

    "abstract": "The anti-inflammatory effects of pseudoephedrine/ephedrine were investigated using the experimental model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute liver failure in D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-sensitised male rats in order to elucidate effects other than sympathomimetic effects. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with D-GalN (400 mg/kg) and LPS (40 mug/kg) to induce acute liver failure. The treatment groups were then intraperitoneally administered pseudoephedrine/ephedrine at 0 h and 4 h after induction and the activation induced by treatment with pseudoephedrine and/or LPS on the primary Kupffer cells (KCs) was monitored. Compared with controls induced by GalN/LPS alone, pseudoephedrine dramatically reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells and bile ductular hyperplasia and hepatic necrosis observed in liver sections. It inhibited both hepatocellular apoptosis and the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1. It lowered the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the beginning of acute liver failure induced by D-GalN/LPS. Correspondingly, levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBIL) and malondialdehyde were attenuated. Ephedrine demonstrated all these identical protective effects as well. In addition, pseudoephedrine significantly suppressed the production of p-IkappaB-alpha, reducing the degradation of sequestered nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) in the cytoplasm, and inhibited the translocation of NF-kappaB/p65 to the nucleus, the transcription of TNF-alpha mRNA and the production of TNF-alpha in primary KCs.

In cells expressing the 5-HT(4(b)) and 5-HT(4(e)) splice variants, SL65.0155 acted as a partial agonist, stimulating cAMP production with a maximal effect of 40 to 50% of serotonin. However, in the rat esophagus preparation, SL65.0155 acted as a 5-HT(4) antagonist with a pK(b) of 8.81. In addition, SL65.0155 potently improved performance in several tests of learning and memory. In the object recognition task, it improved retention at 24 h when administered i.p. or p.o. (0.001-0.1 mg/kg). This effect was antagonized by the 5-HT(4) antagonist SDZ 205,557, itself without effect, demonstrating that the promnesic effects of SL65.0155 are mediated by 5-HT(4) agonism. SL65.0155 also reversed the cognitive deficits of aged rats in the linear maze task and the scopolamine-induced deficit of mice in the water maze task. Furthermore, the combined administration of an inactive dose of SL65.0155 with the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine resulted in a significant promnesic effect, suggesting a synergistic interaction. SL65.0155 was devoid of unwanted cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or central nervous system effects with doses up to more than 100-fold higher than those active in the cognitive tests. These results characterize SL65.0155 as a novel promnesic agent acting via 5-HT(4) receptors, with an excellent preclinical profile. Its broad range of activity in cognitive tests and synergism with cholinesterase inhibitors suggest that SL65.0155 represents a promising new agent for the treatment of dementia.",

We attempted to achieve pharmacologically-induced enhancement of the parasympathomimetic activity of GAL in the key areas of rat brain, using an interactive combination of the alkaloid with the transmembrane enhancer L-carnitine (CAR). METHODS: We investigated activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in brain areas (frontal cortex, basal ganglia, septum and hippocampus) and the hypophysis, and that of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in plasma and liver. RESULTS: Following administration of the highest of the GAL doses used (2.5; 5; 10 mg/kg i.m.), AChE activity decreased mainly in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypophysis. In the interaction of GAL and CAR, AChE inhibition was stronger but without any statistical significance. The peripheral inhibition of BuChE was found to be dose-dependent. Premedication by CAR led to a slight change in the values of the activities monitored. CONCLUSIONS: CAR in terms of positive modulation of GAL targeting to the central nervous system had no statistically significant effect.",

    "abstract": "MRS-2179 is a selective P2Y(1) receptor antagonist, a strong inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation in vitro and ex vivo. By i.v. administration to mice MRS-2179 increases resistance to thromboembolism induced by a mixture of collagen and epinephrine or by a tissue factor. Likewise, it significantly increases the time to thrombus formation in a ferric chloride-induced model of localized arterial thrombosis. MRS-2179 also confers resistance to localized venous thrombosis, which is dependent on thrombin generation and in which platelets play a relatively minor role as compared to stasis or activation of coagulation. These data provide considerable encouragement for the development of new P2Y(1) receptor antagonists. Nevertheless, the properties of MRS-2179 indicate that new compounds should be optimized in order to increase the half-life of the molecule in vivo and its selectivity and potency at the P2Y(1) receptor. Further directions include the synthesis of molecules with modifications of the nucleotide structure which replace the fragile moiety by a stable bond and should lead to a non-hydrolysable structure. In conclusion, P2Y(1) antagonists have been shown to be efficient antithrombotic agents. MRS-2179 is the first P2Y(1) antagonist with antithrombotic action. Its effectiveness demonstrates that the P2Y(1) receptor is a potentially promising target for drugs designed to treat thrombotic syndromes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inhaled corticosteroids, anticholinergics and beta2-adrenoceptor agonists are frequently combined for treating chronic respiratory diseases. We examine the corticosteroid, budesonide, and novel NO-donating derivative, TPI 1020, against histamine- and methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction and whether they enhance the beta2-adrenoceptor agonist formoterol or muscarinic antagonist tiotropium in conscious guinea pigs. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs received inhaled histamine (3 mM) or methacholine (1.5 mM) and specific airway conductance (sG(aw)) was measured before and 15 or 75 min after treatment with budesonide, TPI 1020, tiotropium or formoterol alone or in combinations. KEY RESULTS: Formoterol (0.7-10 microM) and budesonide (0.11-0.7 mM) inhibited histamine-induced bronchoconstriction and tiotropium (2-20 microM) inhibited methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction by up to 70.8 +- 16.6%, 34.9 +- 4.4% and 85.1 +- 14.3%, respectively. Formoterol (2.5 microM) or tiotropium (2 microM) alone exerted small non-significant bronchoprotection. However, when co-administered with TPI 1020 0.11 mM, which alone had no significant effect, there was significant inhibition of the bronchoconstriction (45.7 +- 12.2% and 79.7 +- 21.4%, respectively). Co-administering budesonide (0.11 mM) with tiotropium (2 microM), which alone had no effect, also significantly inhibited the methacholine bronchoconstriction (36.5 +- 13.0%), but there was no potentiation of formoterol against histamine. The NO scavenger, CPTIO, prevented the bronchoprotection by SNAPand TPI 1020. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: TPI 1020 potentiated the bronchoprotection by formoterol and tiotropium. Budesonide also enhanced the effects of tiotropium but not formoterol. Combination of TPI 1020 with a long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist or muscarinic receptor antagonist may therefore be a more potent therapeutic approach for treatment of chronic respiratory diseases.",

Postural tachycardia, decreased salivary flow, impaired psychomotor function and a diminished level of arousal were observed after intravenous PCZ. Similar effects, but of lower magnitude were observed after single oral doses. During chronic dosing postural tachycardia and antihistaminic effects were observed, the latter not being observed after single doses. 6. After single intravenous dosing the maximal drug effects occurred 2-4 h after peak plasma drug concentrations for all measures except for plasma prolactin and self-scored restlessness 7.

    "abstract": "The effects of two antidepressant drugs, amoxapine and amitriptyline, that belong to distinct chemical classes, have been examined on various biochemical parameters related to serotoninergic and opioidergic neurotransmission in the rat brain and spinal cord. In vitro binding studies showed that both amoxapine and amitriptyline interact in the nanomolar range with 5-HT2 receptors labelled by [3H]ketanserin in cortical membranes. By contrast, neither amoxapine nor amitriptyline can be considered as possible ligands of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors because their affinities for these sites are in the micromolar range (or even worse). Interestingly, amoxapine binds with a good affinity (IC50 = 0.30 microM) to 5-HT3 receptors labelled by [3H]zacopride in cortical membranes. Complementary experiments using the 5-HT3-dependent Bezold-Jarisch reflex confirmed that amoxapine really acts in vivo as a 5-HT3 antagonist (IC50 = 50 micrograms/kg i.v.), whereas amitriptyline is essentially inactive on 5-HT3 receptors. The second part of this study consisted of looking for possible changes in central 5-HT receptors 24 h after either a single or a repeated (for 14 days) treatment with amoxapine (10 mg/kg i.p. each day) or amitriptyline (10 mg/kg i.p.). A marked decrease in the density of 5-HT2 receptors was found in the cerebral cortex in both treatment groups. By contrast, neither 5-HT1A nor 5-HT1B receptors were significantly affected in any brain region studied. Finally we explored whether acute and/or chronic administration of amoxapine or amitriptyline affected the levels of opioid peptides and the mu and delta classes of opioid receptors in various regions of the brain and the spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to ethambutol (EMB) has been assigned to an operon, embCAB, which has been proposed to be a structural gene for mycobacterial arabinosyl transferases. Recently, genetic events resulting in structural mutations at embB have been proposed as major contributors to the EMB-resistance of isolates whose minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) level is higher than 20 microgram/ml. On the contrary, isolates with a MIC level lower than 20 microgram/ml do not seem to contain any sequence alterations. In this study, in an effort to understand the role of embB mutations at a low-level of EMB resistance, we investigated the sequence polymorphisms of clinical isolates whose MIC levels are lower than 10 microgram/ml. Accordingly, the sequence alterations of a 312-bp region of the embB gene containing the 306th codon, which has been assigned as a hot-spot for EMB-resistance related mutations, were determined for 21 EMB-resistant and 5 EMB-susceptible clinical isolates. In brief, among 21 EMB- resistant isolates examined, 12 (57.1%) contained mutations in embB (10 at the 306th codon and 2 at other sites), and the remaining isolates 9 contained no mutations in any region of embB. The observed mutations included M306V, M306I, and M306L substitutions that have been reported previously. However, 3 were novel types, which included M306T, A313G and Y319C, D328Y [corrected] double substitutions. On the other hand, all of the EMB-susceptible isolates were found to be free of mutations. In conclusion, our findings suggest that sequence polymorphism of embB may play a pivotal role in the EMB- resistance of M. tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine (METH) is abused by about 5% of the United States population with approximately 10-15% of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) patients reporting its use. METH abuse accelerates the onset and severity of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and astrocyte-induced neurotoxicity. METH activates G-protein coupled receptors such as trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in presynaptic cells of monoaminergic systems. In the present study, we investigated the effects of METH and HIV-1 on primary human astrocyte TAAR1 expression, function and glutamate clearance. Our results demonstrate combined conditions increased TAAR1 mRNA levels 7-fold and increased intracellular cAMP levels. METH and beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), known TAAR1 agonists, increased intracellular cAMP levels in astrocytes. Further, TAAR1 knockdown significantly reduced intracellular cAMP levels in response to METH/beta-PEA, indicating signaling through astrocyte TAAR1. METH+-HIV-1 decreased excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT-2) mRNA and significantly decreased glutamate clearance. RNA interference for TAAR1 prevented METH-mediated decreases in EAAT-2. TAAR1 knockdown significantly increased glutamate clearance, which was further heightened significantly by METH. Moreover, TAAR1 overexpression significantly decreased EAAT-2 levels and glutamate clearance that were further reduced by METH. Taken together, our data show that METH treatment activated TAAR1 leading to intracellular cAMP in human astrocytes and modulated glutamate clearance abilities. Furthermore, molecular alterations in astrocyte TAAR1 levels correspond to changes in astrocyte EAAT-2 levels and function. To our knowledge this is the first report implicating astrocyte TAAR1 as a novel receptor for METH during combined injury in the context of HAND.",

    "abstract": "We report the development of CoMFA analysis models that correlate the 3D chemical structures of 80 compounds with 6-5 fused ring system synthesized in our laboratory and their inhibitory potencies against tgDHFR and rlDHFR. In addition to conventional CoMFA analysis, we used two routines available in the literature aimed at the optimization of CoMFA: all-orientation search (AOS) and cross-validated r(2)-guided region selection (q(2)-GRS) to further optimize the models. During this process, we identified a problem associated with q(2)-GRS routine and modified using two strategies. Thus, for the inhibitory activity against each enzyme (tgDHFR and rlDHFR), five CoMFA models were developed using the conventional CoMFA, AOS optimized CoMFA, the original q(2)-GRS optimized CoMFA and the modified q(2)-GRS optimized CoMFA using the first and the second strategy. In this study, we demonstrate that the modified q(2)-GRS routines are superior to the original routine. On the basis of the steric contour maps of the models, we designed four new compounds in the 2,4-diamino-5-methyl-6-phenylsulfanyl-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine series. As predicted, the new compounds were potent and selective inhibitors of tgDHFR. One of them, 2,4-diamino-5-methyl-6-(2',6'-dimethylphenylthio)pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine, is the first 6-5 fused ring system compound with nanomolar tgDHFR inhibitory activity. The HCl salt of this compound was also prepared to increase solubility. Both forms of the drug were tested in vivo in a Toxoplasma gondii infection mouse model. The results indicate that both forms were active with the HCl salt significantly more potent than the free base.",

    "abstract": "Echinocandins inhibit the synthesis of beta-1,3-D-glucan in Candida and are the first-line therapy in numerous clinical settings. Their use is limited by poor oral bioavailability, and they are available only as intravenous therapies. Derivatives of enfumafungin are novel orally bioavailable glucan synthase inhibitors. We performed an in vivo pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluation with a novel enfumafungin derivative, SCY-078 (formerly MK-3118), in a well-established neutropenic murine model of invasive candidiasis against C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. The SCY-078 MICs varied 8-fold. Oral doses of 3.125 to 200 mg/kg SCY-078 salt in sterile water produced peak levels of 0.04 to 2.66 mug/ml, elimination half-lives of 5.8 to 8.5 h, areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24 h) of 0.61 to 41.10 mug h/ml, and AUC from 0 to infinity (AUC0- ) values of 0.68 to 40.31 mug h/ml. The pharmacokinetics (PK) were approximately linear over the dose range studied. Maximum response (Emax) and PK/PD target identification studies were performed with 4 C. albicans, 4 C. glabrata, and 3 C. parapsilosis isolates. The PD index AUC/MIC was explored by using total (tAUC) and free (fAUC) drug concentrations. The maximum responses were 4.0, 4.0, and 4.3 log10 CFU/kidney reductions for C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis, respectively. The AUC/MIC was a robust predictor of efficacy (R2, 0.53 to 0.91). The 24-h PD targets were a static dose of 63.5 mg/kg, a tAUC/MIC of 500, and an fAUC/MIC of 1.0 for C. albicans; a static dose of 58.4 mg/kg, a tAUC/MIC of 315, and an fAUC/MIC of 0.63 for C. glabrata; and a static dose of 84.4 mg/kg, a tAUC/MIC of 198, and an fAUC/MIC of 0.40 for C. parapsilosis. The mean fAUC/MIC values associated with a 1-log kill endpoint against these species were 1.42, 1.26, and 0.91 for C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis, respectively. The static and 1-log kill endpoints were measured relative to the burden at the start of therapy. The static and 1-log kill doses, as well as the total and free drug AUC/MIC PD targets, were not statistically different between species but were numerically lower than those observed for echinocandins. SCY-078 is a promising novel oral glucan synthase inhibitor against Candida species, and further investigation is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) potassium binding resins increase colonic potassium excretion and are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hyperkalemia. In 2009, the FDA recommended that sorbitol, a cathartic often given with SPS to prevent obstipation, not be added to SPS powder because of associated colonic necrosis. A premixed oral suspension of SPS in 33% sorbitol was not included in this warning. SPS resins increase stool potassium excretion in normokalemic subjects, but proportionately more potassium is excreted due to cathartics when the two are combined. In hyperkalemic patients, oral SPS mixed in water significantly decreases serum potassium within 24 hours. SPS/sorbitol-associated colonic necrosis is most commonly seen in patients who have received enemas in the setting of recent abdominal surgery, bowel injury, or intestinal dysfunction. It is a rare event, on the order of 0.2 to 0.3%, almost exclusively present in patients at risk. The agent most likely associated with colonic necrosis is 70% sorbitol, and animal data support that etiology. There is very little data to suggest that oral SPS given with 33% sorbitol (in the premixed form) or SPS powder in water orally or as an enema causes colonic necrosis. SPS ion-exchange resins are the only agents, other than dialysis and diuretics, available to increase potassium excretion in hyperkalemia, and when used appropriately, they appear to be clinically effective and reasonably safe.",

Subsequently, rats were used to compare pharmacokinetic properties of the film preparation applied topically into the oral cavity with those of oral administration of prochlorperazine solution. None of the parameters, including T(max), C(max), area under curves, clearance and steady-state distribution volume was significantly different between oral disintegrating film and oral solution.

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that is associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction. The mechanisms that lead to airflow obstruction in asthma are bronchoconstriction, mucosal edema, increased secretion of mucus, and an inflammatory-cell infiltrate that is rich in eosinophils. Leukotrienes (LTs) B4, C4, D4, and E4 have been shown experimentally to play a role in each of these inflammatory mechanisms and to mimic the pathologic changes seen in asthma. Inhaled LTC4 and LTD4 are the most potent bronchoconstrictors yet studied in human subjects. LTC4 and LTD4 also may cause migration of inflammatory cells into the asthmatic airway. LTs are derived from the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, and increased production of LTs has been demonstrated in patients who have asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists and specific inhibitors of the 5-LO pathway hold great promise as new therapies to treat asthma. Because LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 appear to interact with a common LTD4 receptor, selective LTD4 receptor antagonists (eg, pranlukast [SB205312/ONO-1078], zafirlukast [ICI 204,219], MK-571, and MK-679), as well as zileuton (A-64077, a direct inhibitor of 5-LO) have been developed as antiasthma agents. Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated the efficacy of these compounds in reducing not only the symptoms of asthma, but use of beta 2-agonists and bronchoconstriction induced by exposure to allergens, exercise, aspirin, and cold air.",

All of the DA indirect agonists dose-dependently substituted for cocaine and shifted the cocaine dose-effect curve leftward. Isobolographic analysis indicated the interactions were generally additive, although both methamphetamine and d-amphetamine were quantitatively determined to be more potent than DA uptake inhibitors in shifting the cocaine dose-effect function to the left. The potential of d-amphetamine as an effective treatment for cocaine abuse and negative clinical results with dopamine uptake inhibitors suggest that differences in shifts in dose-effect curves should be further examined with emerging clinical data as a predictive index of potential treatments for cocaine abuse.",

Our previous study shows that lidocaine, at the level of tissue concentration under topical or local administration, has a direct inhibitory effect on the activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a potential target for antiproliferation in cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that lidocaine would suppress the proliferation of cancer cells through the inhibition of EGFR activity. We investigated the effects of lidocaine (40-4000 microM) on proliferation of a human tongue cancer cell line, CAL27, which has a high level of EGFR expression, and also examined the effect of lidocaine on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated autophosphorylation of EGFR in CAL27 cells. A clinical concentration of lidocaine (400 microM) suppressed both serum-induced and EGF-induced proliferation of CAL27 cells and inhibited EGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR without cytotoxicity. A larger concentration of lidocaine (4000 microM) showed cytotoxicity with an antiproliferative effect. We suggest that the inhibition of EGF-stimulated EGFR activity is one of the mechanisms of the antiproliferative effect of lidocaine on CAL27 cells. Lidocaine administered topically within the oral cavity for cancer pain relief may suppress the proliferation of human tongue cancer cells.",

TPMT \"deficiency\" is associated with grossly elevated TGN concentrations and profound toxicity after a short course of thiopurine therapy. Variant alleles producing a functional loss of TPMT activity have now been described. Although all the ethnic groups investigated to date have the same wild-type enzyme, TPMT variant allele frequencies vary. Potentially, TPMT activity can influence a number of compounds that could be coadministered with thiopurine drugs. After a therapeutic dose of aspirin, plasma concentrations of salicylic acid are within the range for TPMT inhibition. Sulfasalazine and its metabolite 5-aminosalicylic acid inhibit TPMT, and concurrent furosemide therapy could influence the S-methylation of thiopurines. In addition, TPMT could interfere with disulfiram treatment in alcoholism. TPMT S-methylates the diethyldithiocarbamate metabolite involved in disulfiram activation.",

    "abstract": "The antitumor activity of camptothecin (CPT) and its derivatives, including water-soluble topotecan (TPT), is determined by their ability to inhibit human DNA topoisomerase I (top 1). On the other hand, TPT has been recently shown to bind to DNA. The proposed models are based on a two-step mechanism of TPT (CPT) dimer interaction with two spatially close DNA duplexes. At the first step, the CPT lactone form binds to DNA (Streltsov et al., Mol. Biol. vol. 36, no. 5 (2002)) through hydrogen bonding of its C16a carbonyl with the guanine 2-amino group. At the second step, CPT is converted to the carboxylate form. In the absence of top 1, the C17 hydroxyl of CPT is involved in ester exchange (nicking of the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone followed by covalent joining of free phosphate to C17) whereas its C20 carboxyl forms two hydrogen bonds with the same guanine nucleotide at the opposite end of the broken DNA backbone. As a result, CPT binds to both ends of the broken DNA. The resulting CPT-DNA complex is alkali-labile. In the presence of top 1, after CPT conversion to the carboxylate form and DNA nicking, the C17 hydroxyl makes a branching hydrogen bond with N1 and N3 of guanine while the C20 carboxyl makes two hydrogen bonds with the NH of Tyr723 and N(delta2)H(2) of Asp722. Owing to this, rotation of one end of the broken sugar-phosphate backbone about the other becomes impossible; hence the CPT inhibitory effect on top 1. The proposed models are consistent with the current body of experimental data.",

It demonstrates a longer circulation half-life and extended time to peak levels when compared with recombinant FSH (rFSH).

To find novel tubulin polymerization inhibitors as anti-mitotic agents, we performed a virtual screening study of the colchicine binding site on tubulin. Novel tubulin inhibitors were identified and characterized by their inhibitory activities on tubulin polymerization in vitro. The structural basis for the interaction of novel inhibitors with tubulin was investigated by molecular modeling, and we have proposed binding models for these hit compounds with tubulin. The proposed docking models were very similar to the binding pattern of colchicine or podophyllotoxin with tubulin. These new hit compound derivatives exerted growth inhibitory effects on the HL60 cell lines tested and exhibited strong cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Furthermore, these compounds induced apoptosis after cell cycle arrest.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: CRTH2 is a G-protein-coupled receptor on T helper2 cells that mediates pro-inflammatory effects of prostaglandin D2 in allergic responses. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of setipiprant (ACT-129968), a selective orally active CRTH2 antagonist, in allergic asthmatics and to assess the protective effects of multiple doses of this drug against allergen-induced airway responses. METHODS: In this 3-centre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 18 allergic asthmatic males were randomized to setipiprant 1000 mg or matching placebo b.i.d. for 5 consecutive days. Study periods were separated by a washout of &gt;= 3 weeks. On study day 4, subjects underwent a standardized allergen challenge and airway response was recorded by FEV1 until 10 h post-allergen. Airway responsiveness to methacholine and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) were measured pre- and post-dosing. The effects of both treatments on the allergen-induced airway responses were compared by a paired Student's t-test. RESULTS: Fifteen subjects completed the study per-protocol and were included in the analysis. Overall, setipiprant was well tolerated and no clinically relevant adverse events occurred. Trough plasma concentrations showed a high inter-subject variability. Compared with placebo, setipiprant significantly reduced the allergen-induced late asthmatic response (LAR), inhibiting the area under the response vs. time curve (AUC(3-10 h) ) by on average 25.6% (P = 0.006) and significantly protected against the allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to methacholine (P = 0.0029). There was no difference in the early asthmatic response (EAR) or in allergen-induced changes in eNO between treatments. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Setipiprant at multiple oral doses was well tolerated and reduced both the allergen-induced LAR and the associated AHR in allergic asthmatics. Our findings confirm that CRTH2 may be a promising target for the treatment of allergic disorders.",

    "abstract": "The well known and accepted mode of action of cardiac glycosides is inhibition of the ubiquitous plasma membrane Na+, K+-ATPase that leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ ion concentrations. Ca2+ ions play pivotal role in many signaling pathways including those regulating apoptosis. It has been suggested that some forms of cardiac glycosides inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells in clinically relevant concentrations. It was also found out that the degree to which cardiac glycosides inhibited cancer cell growth was correlated to topoisomerase II-inhibiting activity. Digitoxin at concentrations found in cardiac patients induced levels of DNA-topoisomerase II cleavable complexes similar to etoposide, a topoisomerase II poison widely used in cancer chemotherapy. Cardiac glycosides can also regulate one of the most potent angiogenesis promoting substances, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and may inhibit activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. FGF-2 and NF-kappaB are relevant targets for anticancer drugs. There is growing interest in evaluating the oleander products and possibly other cardiac glycosides as antineoplastic agents. The first of these therapies to be developed in the United States is a patented, water-soluble oleander extract called Anvirzel.",

We examined whether pironetin is an effective agent against human small cell lung cancer H69 cells, including two cell lines resistant to the microtubule-targeted drugs vindesine (H69/VDS) and paclitaxel (H69/Txl) that interact with beta-tubulin. Pironetin was found to be effective against these resistant cells as well as their parental cells. In addition, pironetin inhibited the growth of human leukemic K562 multidrug-resistant cells (K562/ADM), which have mdr1 gene expression, as well as the parental K562 cells. In these cell lines, including the parental and resistant cells, pironetin caused complete mitotic arrest; in addition, apoptosis inductions by 30 and 100 nM pironetin were observed. In this study, the new mitotic inhibitor, pironetin, was found to be effective not only against human tumor cell lines resistant to microtubule-targeted drugs, but also multidrug-resistant cells with mdr1 gene expression.

    "abstract": "The novel benzodioxopiperazine, 5-HT1A receptor weak partial agonist, S 15535 (4-(benzodioxan-5-yl)1-(indan-2-yl)piperazine) bound with high affinity and selectivity to membranes of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells stably expressing the human (h) 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 0.6 nM versus [3H]-8-hydroxy-dipropylamino-tetralin, [3H]-8-OH-DPAT): its affinity at h5-HT1A receptors was more than 70-fold higher than its affinity at &gt; 50 other binding sites. S 15535 was tritiated to high specific activity (50 Ci/mmol) and its binding profile characterised. At 22 degrees C, [3H]-S 15535 associated and dissociated from h5-HT1A receptors with half-times of 2.9 and 5.0 min, respectively, yielding a Kd estimate of 3.6 nM. In saturation binding experiments, [3H]-S 15535 displayed a Bmax value for h5-HT1A receptors (1630 fmol/mg), higher than that obtained with the agonist [3H]-8-OH-DPAT (1023 pmol/mg). Guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GppNHp, 100 microM) reduced the binding of [3H]-S 15535 by only 25% compared with 79% for [3H]-8-OH-DPAT at h5-HT1A receptors. [3H]-S 15535 also showed high affinity, saturable binding to rat hippocampal membranes (Bmax = 820 fmol/mg versus 647 fmol/mg for [3H]-8-OH-DPAT). For both h5-HT1A and rat 5-HT1A receptors, the Ki values for competition binding of 15 serotonergic ligands with [3H]-S 15535 was highly correlated with that of [3H]-8-OH-DPAT. However, important differences were also observed. The agonist, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), displayed biphasic competition curves with [3H]-S 15535 but not with [3H]-8-OH-DPAT at h5-HT1A receptors. Similarly, the 'antagonists', spiperone, methiothepin and (+)butaclamol, showed biphasic competition isotherms versus [3H]-S 15535 but not [3H]-8-OH-DPAT. When [3H]-S 15535 competition binding experiments were carried out in the presence of GppNHp (100 microM) the 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT competition curves shifted to the right, whereas the spiperone and methiothepin competition curves shifted to the left. In contrast, in the presence of GppNHp, the competition isotherms for N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclo-h exanecarboxamide (WAY 100,635) were not altered. Taken together, these data show that (i) [3H]-S 15535 is a highly selective 5-HT1A receptor ligand which labels both G-protein-coupled and uncoupled 5-HT1A receptors, (ii) antagonists, such as WAY 100,635, which yield monophasic isotherms in competition with both [3H]-agonists and [3H]-antagonists, are not sensitive to the G-protein coupling state of the receptor, but (iii) spiperone and methiothepin behaved as inverse agonists, their competition isotherms with [3H]-S 15535 being modulated in an opposite manner to those of agonists.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The bradycardia produced by pyridostigmine and physostigmine in an animal model of acute cardiac denervation was examined according to its relation to cholinesterase inhibition and sensitivity to block by cholinergic receptor antagonists. METHODS: Cats were anaesthetised, vagotomised and propranolol-treated. Heart rate was continuously recorded. Erythrocyte cholinesterase activity of arterial blood was measured using a radiometric technique. Nicotinic and muscarinic M1 receptors were blocked with hexamethonium and pirenzepine, respectively. M2 receptors were blocked with gallamine, pancuronium and AFDX-116. RESULTS: With pyridostigmine and physostigmine the dose-response relationship for the decrease in heart rate (ED50 1.05 +/- 0.25 and 0.198 +/- 0.03 mg.kg-1, respectively) was shifted to the right of that for the inhibition of cholinesterase activity (ED50 0.094 +/- 0.03 and 0.032 +/- 0.01 mg.kg-1, respectively). The decrease in cholinesterase activity reached a plateau at a cumulative dose of 0.56 +/- 0.08 and 0.32 +/- 0.08 mg.kg-1, respectively. In contrast, there did not appear to be a plateau in the bradycardic effect. The bradycardia produced by pyridostigmine and physostigmine was blocked by hexamethonium (ED50 10 +/- 1.3 and 15.3 +/- 2.4 mg.kg-1, respectively), pirenzepine (ED50 68 +/- 16 and 138 +/- 32 micrograms.kg-1, respectively), gallamine (56 +/- 11 and 67 +/- 17 micrograms.kg-1, respectively), pancuronium (32 +/- 10 and 30 +/- 4 micrograms.kg-1, respectively), and AFDX-116 (31 +/- 4 and 28 +/- 4 micrograms.kg-1, respectively). CONCLUSION: The bradycardia produced by reversible anticholinesterase drugs containing a carbamyl group is not clearly related to the degree of cholinesterase activity, and has a low sensitivity to nicotinic and muscarinic M1 and a high sensitivity to muscarinic M2 receptor antagonists.",

A correct ranking of the relative inhibition of DHFR was achieved utilizing the linear interaction energy method. The soft drugs are intended for local administration.

The aim of our study was to investigate the in vitro development of macrolide resistance in M. hominis and to study the impact of ribosomal mutations on MICs of various macrolides and related antibiotics. METHODS: Selection of macrolide-resistant mutants was performed by serial passages of M. hominis PG21 in broth medium containing subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin, pristinamycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and telithromycin. Stepwise selection of josamycin-resistant mutants was performed onto agar medium containing increasing inhibitory concentrations of josamycin. Resistant mutants were characterized by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of 23S rRNA, L4 and L22 ribosomal protein genes. RESULTS: Various mutations in domain II or V of 23S rRNA were selected in the presence of each selector antibiotic and were associated with several resistance phenotypes. Josamycin was the sole antibiotic that selected for single amino acid changes in ribosomal proteins L4 and L22. Unexpectedly, the C2611U transition selected in the presence of clindamycin and the quinupristin/dalfopristin combination was associated with decreased MICs of erythromycin, azithromycin and telithromycin, leading to a loss of the intrinsic resistance of M. hominis to erythromycin and azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Ribosomal mutations were associated with resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics in M. hominis. Some mutants showed a loss of the intrinsic resistance to erythromycin and azithromycin.",

This discrepancy is attributable at least in part to the rapid metabolism of hydroxamates to the corresponding carboxylic acids, which are inactive against the enzyme. A study of the structural features that affect this metabolism revealed that 2-arylpropionohydroxamic acids are relatively resistant to metabolic hydrolysis.

    "abstract": "Stress is a major driving force in reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has been identified as a key brain region in this behavior, and receives a dense input of the stress-neurotransmitter norepinephrine through the ventral noradrenergic bundle. Activation of alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors (alpha(2)-ARs) in the BNST blocks stress-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking, indicating a potentially important role for these receptors. Currently, it is unclear how alpha(2)-AR agonists elicit this behavioral action, or through which alpha(2)-AR subtype. Activation of alpha(2)-ARs decreases glutamatergic transmission in the BNST, an effect which is nearly absent in the alpha(2A)-AR knockout mouse. Here, we take advantage of a knock-in mouse in which a hemagglutinin-tagged alpha(2A)-AR was inserted into the endogenous locus, along with the alpha(2A)-AR selective agonist guanfacine, to further study the role of the alpha(2A)-AR subtype in modulation of neurotransmission in the BNST. Using immunohistochemistry, we find that alpha(2A)-ARs are highly expressed in the BNST, and that this expression is more similar in distribution to the vesicular glutamate transporters than to either norepinephrine transporter or tyrosine hydroxylase positive terminals. Using whole cell patch-clamp recordings, we show that guanfacine causes a depression of evoked excitatory and, to a more limited extent, inhibitory fast synaptic transmission. In total, these data support a prominent heterosynaptic role for alpha(2A)-ARs in modulating fast synaptic transmission in the BNST.",

Eighty percent (N = 334) of the enrolled patients developed some manifestation of gram-negative sepsis, defined by the administration of gram-negative specific antibiotics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The in-hospital mortality rate of patients who received penicillin-binding protein 3/tumor necrosis factor (PBP3/TNF)-specific antibiotics associated with the greatest degree of endotoxin release and TNF production (PBP3/TNF group, n = 78: aztreonam, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime sodium) was compared with that of patients not receiving these agents (non-PBP3/TNF group, n = 256). RESULTS: Mortality in the PBP3/TNF group (17%) was higher than in the non-PBP3/TNF group (8%, P = .02). The two groups were similar in their mean (+/- SD) Injury Severity Scores (34 +/- 9), ages (31 +/- 12 years), and initial degree of bacterial contamination. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics that are associated with greater release of endotoxin and production of TNF are also associated with greater mortality in septic trauma patients. Decisions regarding antibiotic administration may need to consider the endotoxin-releasing properties of antibiotics in addition to their antibacterial sensitivity spectrum. Prospective studies of the effect of endotoxin-releasing properties of antibiotics on mortality are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Reduction in surface beta(1)-adrenoceptor (beta1AR) density is thought to play a critical role in mediating the therapeutic long term effects of antidepressants. Since antidepressants are neither agonists nor antagonists for G protein-coupled receptors, receptor density must be regulated through processes independent of direct receptor activation. Endocytosis and recycling of the beta1AR fused to green fluorescent protein at its carboxyl-terminus (beta1AR-GFP) were analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy of live cells and complementary ligand binding studies. In stably transfected C6 glioblastoma cells, beta1AR-GFP displayed identical ligand-binding isotherms and adenylyl cyclase activation as native beta1AR. Upon exposure to isoproterenol, a fraction of beta1AR-GFP (10-15%) internalized rapidly and colocalized with endocytosed transferrin receptors in an early endosomal compartment in the perinuclear region. Chronic treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (DMI) did not affect internalization characteristics of beta1AR-GFP when challenged with isoproterenol. However, internalized receptors were not able to recycle back to the cell surface in DMI-treated cells, whereas recycling of transferrin receptors was not affected. Endocytosed receptors were absent from structures that stained with fluorescently labeled dextran, and inhibition of lysosomal protease activity did not restore receptor recycling, indicating that beta1AR-GFP did not immediately enter the lysosomal compartment. The data suggest a new mode of drug action causing a \"switch\" of receptor fate from a fast recycling pathway to a slowly exchanging perinuclear compartment. Antidepressant-induced reduction of receptor surface expression may thus be caused by modulation of receptor trafficking routes.",

    "abstract": "Cisapride, a gastrointestinal prokinetic agent, is known to cause long Q-T syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. The cellular mechanism is not known. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG), which encodes the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current and is important in cardiac repolarization, may serve as a target for the action of cisapride. We tested the hypothesis that cisapride blocks HERG. The whole cell patch-clamp recording technique was used to study HERG channels stably expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells. Under voltage-clamp conditions, cisapride block of HERG is dose dependent with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 6.5 nM at 22 degrees C (n = 25 cells). Currents rapidly recovered with drug washout. The onset of block by cisapride required channel activation indicative of open or inactivated state blockage. Block of HERG with cisapride after channel activation was voltage dependent. At -20 mV, 10 nM cisapride reduced HERG tail-current amplitude by 5%, whereas, at + 20 mV, the tail-current amplitude was reduced by 45% (n = 4 cells). At -20 and + 20 mV, 100 nM cisapride reduced tail-current amplitude by 66 and 90%, respectively. We conclude that cisapride is a potent blocker of HERG channels expressed in HEK293 cells. This effect may account for the clinical occurrence of Q-T prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias observed with cisapride.",

Its activity over a panel of nine tumoral cell lines was in the nanomolar range for all of the histological types tested, and surprisingly, the resistant KB-A1 cell line was also sensitive to this compound. Moreover, a flow cytometric study showed that L1210 cells treated by the most potent compounds were arrested in the G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle with a significant percentage of cells having reinitiated a cycle of DNA synthesis without cell division.

METHODS: Patients entered a 2-week placebo run-in period, followed by randomization to treatment with tamsulosin (382 patients) or placebo (193 patients) once daily for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Maximum urinary flow rate improved to a greater extent in the tamsulosin group (1.6 ml/s, 16%) than the placebo group (0.6 ml/s, 6%) (p = 0.002). Total Boyarsky symptom score also improved to a greater extent in the tamsulosin group (3.3 points, 35.1% reduction) than the placebo group (2.4 points, 25.5% reduction) (p = 0.002). Significantly more tamsulosin patients (66%) than placebo patients (49%) had a &gt; or = 25% decrease in total symptom score at endpoint (p &lt; 0.001). Twelve weeks of treatment with tamsulosin also produced significant improvements in average urinary flow rate (p = 0.005) and voiding or \"obstructive\" (p = 0.008) and storage or \"irritative' (p = 0.017) symptom scores. The incidence of drug-related adverse events was comparable for the tamsulosin and placebo groups (13 and 12% respectively, p = 0.802). The same applies to the incidence of adverse events commonly attributed to alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as dizziness, headache, postural hypotension, syncope, asthenia, somnolence and rhinitis. There were no clinically significant changes in blood pressure or pulse rate in tamsulosin patients compared with placebo patients both in hypertensive and normotensive BPH patients.

    "abstract": "CS-747 (Prasugrel, LY640315) is a thienopyridine antiplatelet prodrug that is metabolized to the thiol-containing active metabolite R-138727,which binds to and irreversibly inhibits the platelet P2Y12ADP receptor. R-138727 is composed of 4 stereo-isomers, (R, S)-, (R, R)-, (S, S)-, and (S, R)-isomers (the first letter for the configuration of a chiral center at the sulfur-bearing position and the second for that at the benzylic position). In the present study, we determined the stereoselectivity of P2Y12 antagonist effects by assessing the antagonism of the [3H]-2-MeS-ADP that binds to human P2Y12 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells as an affinity assay, and by the inhibition of ADP-induced aggregation of washed human platelets as a functional assay. R-138727 and its 2 components, R-99224, a mixture of (R, S)- and (S, R)-isomers and R-100364, a mixture of (R, R)- and (S, S)-isomers, inhibited [3H]-2-MeS-ADP binding and platelet aggregation. The rank order of potency of these compounds were identical in both assays: R-99224&gt;R-138727&gt;&gt; R-100364. Inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by R-138727 and R-99224 was concentration- and time-related. In experiments using the 4 single stereo-isomers, all isomers inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation, but the (R, S)-isomer was found to be the most potent, followed by the (R, R)-isomer. These in vitro studies indicate that R- 138727 is an effective antagonist of P2Y12 and potent inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and that these antiplatelet activities of R-138727 are largely dependent on its (R, S)-isomer. This suggests that the (R)-configuration of the reactive thiol group of the active metabolite of CS-747 is critical for P2Y12 and platelet inhibitory activities.",

    "title": "Emergency contraception.",
    "abstract": "There have been numerous attempts to control fertility after unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI). From very bizarre methods like the vaginal application of Coca Cola to the more serious attempts using calcium antagonists influencing fertility parameters in sperm to hormonal methods or intrauterine devices. So far, hormonal methods preventing or delaying ovulation have proved to be the most popular starting with the combination of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel (LNG), known as the Yuzpe regimen. The first dose had to be taken within 72 hours of UPSI, a second one 12 hours later. Later on, LNG alone, at first in a regimen similar to the Yuzpe method (2 x 0.75 mg 12 hours apart) showed to be more successful, eventually resulting in the development of a 1.5 mg LNG pill that combined good efficacy with a high ease of use. Several efficacious and easy to use methods for emergency contraception (EC) are available on the market today with the most widely spread being LNG in a single dose of 1.5 mg (given as one tablet of 1.5 mg or 2 tablets of 0.75 mg each) for administration up to 3 days (according to WHO up to 5 days) after UPSI. Its limitations are the non-optimal efficacy which is decreasing the later the drug is taken and the fact that it is only approved for up to 72 hours after UPSI. This regimen has no effect on the endometrium, corpus luteum function and implantation, is not abortive and don't harm the fetus if accidentally taken in early pregnancy. It has no impact on the rate of ectopic pregnancies. It has become the standard method used up to this day in most countries. Since the mid 1970s copper IUDs have been used for EC, which show a high efficacy. Their disadvantages lie in the fact that EC is considered an off label use for most IUDs (not for the GynFix copper IUD in the European Union) and that they might not be acceptable for every patient. Furthermore IUD-insertion is an invasive procedure and it is required trained providers and sterilized facilities. Mifepristone in the dosages of 10 or 25 mg is used with good results as an emergency contraceptive in China for up to 120 hours after UPSI, but has never received any significant consideration in Western countries. While high doses of mifepristone has an effect on endometrial receptivity and will inhibit ovulation if given in the follicular phase and prevent implantation if given in the early luteal phase, low doses such as 10 mg has no impact on the endometrium. Mifepristone does not increase the rate of ectopic pregnancies. The most recent development is the approval of the selective progesterone receptor modulator ulipristal acetate (UPA) in the dosage of 30 mg for EC up to 5 days after UPSI, combining the safe and easy application of the single dose LNG pill with an even higher efficacy. It has shown to be more efficacious than LNG and can be used for up to 120 hours after UPSI; the difference in efficacy is highest for 0-24 hours, followed by 0-72 hours following UPSI. No VTE has been reported following UPA-administration or any progesterone receptor modulator. No effect on endometrium, corpus luteum function and implantation has been observed with doses used for EC. Independent of the substance it should be noted that, if there is a choice, the intake of an oral emergency contraceptive pill should happen as soon as possible after the risk situation. A pre-existing pregnancy must be excluded. Possible contraindications and drug interactions must be considered according to the individual special product informations.",

    "abstract": "We compared the cardiac electrophysiological actions of two types of H1-receptor antagonists--the piperidines, astemizole and terfenadine, and the nonpiperidines, chlorpheniramine and pyrilamine-in vitro in guinea pig ventricular myocytes and in vivo in chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Astemizole and terfenadine significantly increased action potential duration of guinea pig myocytes. This concentration-dependent prolongation of action potential duration was reverse frequency dependent and led to development of early afterdepolarizations, which occurred more frequently at higher concentrations and slower pacing frequencies. Astemizole and terfenadine potently blocked the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier, IKr, with IC50 values of 1.5 and 50 nmol/L, respectively. At 10 mumol/L, terfenadine but not astemizole blocked the slowly activating component of the delayed rectifier, IKs (58.4 +/- 3.1%), and the inward rectifier, IK1 (20.5 +/- 3.4%). Chlorpheniramine and pyrilamine blocked IKr relatively weakly (IC50 = 1.6 and 1.1 mumol/L, respectively) and IKs and IK1 less than 20% at 10 mumol/L. Astemizole and terfenadine (1.0 to 3.0 mg/kg IV) significantly prolonged the QTc interval and ventricular effective refractory period in vivo. Chlorpheniramine and pyrilamine (&lt; or = 3.0 mg/kg) did not significantly affect these parameters. Block of repolarizing K+ currents, particularly IK1, by astemizole and terfenadine produces reverse rate-dependent prolongation of action potential duration and development of early afterdepolarizations, delays ventricular repolarization, and may underlie the development of torsade de pointes ventricular arrhythmias observed with the use and abuse of these agents.",

Imidazolyl derivatives 2 were found to bind with moderate affinity but with high selectivity to the sst(3) receptor subtype. Further modifications of these structures led to a more potent class of ligands, the tetrahydro-beta-carboline derivatives 4. Among these, compounds 4k (BN81644) and 4n (BN81674) bind selectively and with high affinity to the sst(3) receptor subtype (K(i) = 0.64 and 0.92 nM, respectively). Furthermore, 4k and 4n reverse the inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation induced by 1 nM somatostatin via sst(3) receptors, with IC(50) = 2.7 and 0.84 nM, respectively. The most potent compound 4n was shown to be a competitive antagonist of human sst(3) receptors by increasing the EC(50) of SRIF-14-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation with a K(B) of 2.8 nM (where K(B) is the concentration of antagonist that shifts the agonist dose-response 2-fold).

    "abstract": "Endocrine therapy that targets the estrogen receptor (ER) is a standard of care for the treatment of postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer. The selective ER modulator (SERM) tamoxifen has been in use for the treatment of advanced breast cancer for more than 30 years and is currently a treatment option for all stages of ER-positive disease. Tamoxifen blocks the action of estrogen by binding to the ER, and possesses both ER-agonist and antagonist properties. Unfortunately, long-term use of tamoxifen is associated with several important concerns including an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic complications. In addition, many patients who initially respond to tamoxifen eventually relapse with resistant disease. New treatment approaches are therefore required. A number of alternative SERMs have been tested as substitutes for tamoxifen. These include; toremifene, droloxifene, idoxifene, and keoxifene. Unfortunately, the SERMs have not proved to be more effective than tamoxifen for the treatment of advanced breast cancer and have shown a high level of cross-resistance with tamoxifen. The subsequent development of the aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is an important therapeutic advance by creating a \"no estrogen\" environment. Another approach is the development of pure antiestrogens. Fulvestrant is a novel ER antagonist that destroys the ER and its signaling pathway and is not associated with tamoxifen-like agonist effects. It produces high response rates compared with other SERMs and is not cross-resistant to tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors and is equally as effective as the AI anastrozole in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who have progressed on prior adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. This review article discusses the significant and continuing value of SERMs for the treatment of postmenopausal ER-positive breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the ABL, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and c-kit kinases. Inhibition of BCR-ABL and c-kit accounts for its clinical activity in leukemia and sarcoma, respectively. In this report, we describe other cellular targets for imatinib. Treatment of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells with clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib-induced changes in cell morphology and growth similar to changes associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Imatinib-induced changes were blocked with the EGFR antagonist cetuximab, which suggested direct involvement of EGFR in this process. Western blot analysis of cells incubated with imatinib demonstrated activation of EGFR and downstream signaling that was reduced by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and EGFR, but not Her2/ErbB2. An in vitro kinase assay showed that imatinib did not directly affect EGFR kinase activity, suggesting involvement of EGFR-activating molecules. Inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and to a lesser extent transforming growth factor-alpha, reduced imatinib-mediated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Imatinib stimulated the rapid release of soluble HB-EGF and the subsequent induction of membrane-bound HB-EGF, which correlated with biphasic MAPK activation. Together, these results suggested that imatinib affects EGFR activation and signaling pathways through rapid release and increased expression of endogenous EGFR-activating ligands. Although, imatinib primarily inhibits tyrosine kinases, it also stimulates the activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase in head and neck squamous tumors. This finding demonstrates the need for careful use of this drug in cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "The effects of esmolol at different rates of infusion (100, 250 and 500 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1) were compared with beta-adrenoceptor occupancy (beta 1 and beta 2, estimated by a subtype selective radioreceptor assay) and plasma concentrations of esmolol and its acid metabolite were measured by HPLC. Up to a rate of infusion of esmolol of 500 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1 there was a maximal beta 1-receptor occupancy of 84.7% while beta 2-receptor occupancy was below the detection limit; confirming the beta 1 selectivity of esmolol. Exercise-induced increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure were reduced by esmolol in a dose-dependent manner. The estimated EC50 values of rate of infusion for the reduction in heart rate and systolic blood pressure during exercise were 113 and 134 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1, respectively. Additionally, heart rate and systolic blood pressure were reduced moderately at rest. Because of the short elimination half-life of esmolol caused by the rapid hydrolysis to its acid metabolite, 45 min after end of infusion high plasma concentrations of the metabolite (maximally 80 micrograms.ml-1) but no esmolol were detectable. Since no in vivo effects have been observed, despite the presence of high plasma concentrations of the metabolite, the metabolite did not participate in the observed effects up to an infusion rate of esmolol of 500 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1. The plasma concentrations of antagonist detected by radioreceptor assay and plasma concentrations of esmolol detected by HPLC showed a good correlation (r = 0.97).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "title": "Discovery of beta-arrestin-biased dopamine D2 ligands for probing signal transduction pathways essential for antipsychotic efficacy.",
    "abstract": "Elucidating the key signal transduction pathways essential for both antipsychotic efficacy and side-effect profiles is essential for developing safer and more effective therapies. Recent work has highlighted noncanonical modes of dopamine D(2) receptor (D(2)R) signaling via beta-arrestins as being important for the therapeutic actions of both antipsychotic and antimanic agents. We thus sought to create unique D(2)R agonists that display signaling bias via beta-arrestin-ergic signaling. Through a robust diversity-oriented modification of the scaffold represented by aripiprazole (1), we discovered UNC9975 (2), UNC0006 (3), and UNC9994 (4) as unprecedented beta-arrestin-biased D(2)R ligands. These compounds also represent unprecedented beta-arrestin-biased ligands for a G(i)-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Significantly, UNC9975, UNC0006, and UNC9994 are simultaneously antagonists of G(i)-regulated cAMP production and partial agonists for D(2)R/beta-arrestin-2 interactions. Importantly, UNC9975 displayed potent antipsychotic-like activity without inducing motoric side effects in inbred C57BL/6 mice in vivo. Genetic deletion of beta-arrestin-2 simultaneously attenuated the antipsychotic actions of UNC9975 and transformed it into a typical antipsychotic drug with a high propensity to induce catalepsy. Similarly, the antipsychotic-like activity displayed by UNC9994, an extremely beta-arrestin-biased D(2)R agonist, in wild-type mice was completely abolished in beta-arrestin-2 knockout mice. Taken together, our results suggest that beta-arrestin signaling and recruitment can be simultaneously a significant contributor to antipsychotic efficacy and protective against motoric side effects. These functionally selective, beta-arrestin-biased D(2)R ligands represent valuable chemical probes for further investigations of D(2)R signaling in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus exhibit hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia as well as a markedly increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Here we report the characterization of a novel arylthiazolidinedione capable of lowering both glucose and lipid levels in animal models. This compound, designated TZD18, is a potent agonist with dual human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha/gamma activities. In keeping with its PPARgamma activity, TZD18 caused complete normalization of the elevated glucose in db/db mice and Zucker diabetic fatty rats. TZD18 lowered both cholesterol and triglycerides in hamsters and dogs. TZD18 inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis at steps before mevalonate and reduced hepatic levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity. Moreover, TZD18 significantly suppressed gene expression of fatty acid synthesis and induced expression of genes for fatty acid degradation and triglyceride clearance. Studies on 17 additional PPARalpha or PPARalpha/gamma agonists showed that lipid lowering in hamsters correlated with the magnitude of hepatic gene expression changes. Importantly, the presence of PPARgamma agonism did not affect the relationship between hepatic gene expression and lipid lowering. Taken together, these data suggest that PPARalpha/gamma agonists, such as TZD18, affect lipid homeostasis, leading to an antiatherogenic plasma lipid profile. Agents with these properties may provide favorable means for treatment of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia and the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",

PD134308 and PD135158 produced potent anxiolytic effects in the mouse black/white box test after either subcutaneous or oral administration. There was no evidence of the development of tolerance to the anxiolytic action of either PD134308 or PD135158 in mice treated twice daily for 7 days, nor was there any sign of withdrawal anxiogenesis after abrupt termination of this treatment. Both CCK-B antagonists were able to suppress the withdrawal anxiogenesis and produce an anxiolytic effect in mice previously made tolerant to diazepam. PD134308 and PD135158 produced potent anxiolytic effects in the rat elevated plus maze test and the rat social interaction test. The effects were comparable in magnitude to those seen with diazepam. However, unlike diazepam, PD134308 and PD135158 did not produce sedation. The CCK-B antagonists also showed powerful anxiolytic activity in the \"marmoset human threat test.\" These results provide evidence of a selective role for CCK-B receptors in the control of anxiety.

(3)H-MADAM bound with high affinity in a saturable manner to both human SERT expressed in CHO cells (K(d)=0.20 nm (pK(d)=9.74+/-0.12), B(max)=35+/-4 fmol mg(-1) protein) and mouse cerebral cortex membranes (K(d)=0.21 nm (pK(d)=9.66+/-0.10), B(max)=50+/-24 fmol mg(-1) protein). 3. Binding of (3)H-MADAM was highly selective for SERT in vitro as demonstrated by the in vitro profile of MADAM tested at 75 different receptors, ion channels and transporters. This was further substantiated by the pharmacological profile of the binding. Hence, the binding of (3)H-MADAM was potently inhibited by SSRIs but not by selective inhibitors of noradrenaline transport and dopamine transport. Likewise, a 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist did not inhibit (3)H-MADAM binding. 4. (3)H-MADAM binding in vivo was inhibited only by compounds which also inhibited the binding of (3)H-MADAM in vitro (the SSRIs, mixed SERT/noradrenaline transport inhibitors and clomipramine), confirming the selectivity of (3)H-MADAM for SERT also in vivo. Moreover, compounds effective in inhibiting (3)H-MADAM binding were the only ones found to be active in the mouse 5-HTP potentiation test confirming the model as a behavioural correlate to in vivo 5-HT uptake. 5. Finally, it was found that a SERT occupancy of 85-95% was necessary to produce 50% of the maximum behavioural response (ED(50)).",

Thus, blockade of androgen production in testes and adrenals by CYP17 inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of PC. Moreover, many PC patients suffer from glucocorticoid overproduction, and importantly mutated androgen receptors can be stimulated by glucocorticoids. In this study, the first dual inhibitor of CYP17 and CYP11B1 (the enzyme responsible for the last step in glucocorticoid biosynthesis) is described. A series of biphenylmethylene pyridines has been designed, synthesized, and tested as CYP17 and CYP11B1 inhibitors. The most active compounds were also tested for selectivity against CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase), CYP19 (aromatase), and hepatic CYP3A4. In detail, compound 6 was identified as a dual inhibitor of CYP17/CYP11B1 (IC(50) values of 226 and 287 nM) showing little inhibition of the other enzymes as well as compound 9 as a selective, highly potent CYP17 inhibitor (IC(50) = 52 nM) exceeding abiraterone in terms of activity and selectivity.",

    "abstract": "The effects of muscarinic receptor stimulation were tested on the urethro genital reflex (UGR) in anesthetized and spinal cord-transected rats. Drugs were applied directly to the spinal cord. The electromyographic activity (EMG) of the bulbospongiosus (BS) muscle was used for recording UGR. In six animals BS as well as soleus, posterior biceps or peroneus tertius muscle EMG was recorded simultaneously. Muscarine (5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 microg) was applied in 22 animals after cutting L6-S1 dorsal roots. Some observations were made on another six animals, to which an extensive bilateral dorsal rhizotomy (L3-S2) was performed. Rhythmic bursts of similar frequency and size to those seen during UGR were found in BS muscle a few minutes after muscarine application. No rhythmic bursting was found on the hindlimb muscles, but exclusively on BS muscles. The effects of homatropine (25, 50, 100 and 200 microg), an acetylcholine muscarinic receptor antagonist, were tested in 21 rats after UGR was elicited three times at low stimulation intensity (7 mm Hg). Homatropine produced two effects: (i) A significant increase in the latency of UGR. (ii) A facilitation of UGR inhibition. In view of these results it can be speculated that muscarinic receptor stimulation is involved in the elicitation of UGR.",

In the series under investigation, the IC50 values ranged from 1.2 to approximately 30 nM against chloroquine-sensitive and multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Modest to significant cross-resistance was noted in evaluation of these haloalkyl- and haloalkoxyquinolones for activity against the atovaquone-resistant clinical isolate Tm90-C2B, indicating that a primary target for some of these compounds is the parasite cytochrome bc1 complex. Additional evidence to support this biochemical mechanism includes the use of oxygen biosensor plate technology to show that the quinolone derivatives block oxygen consumption by parasitized red blood cells in a fashion similar to atovaquone in side-by-side experiments. Atovaquone is extremely potent and is the only drug in clinical use that targets the Plasmodium bc1 complex, but rapid emergence of resistance to it in both mono- and combination therapy is evident and therefore additional drugs are needed to target the cytochrome bc1 complex which are active against atovaquone-resistant parasites. Our study of a number of halogenated alkyl and alkoxy 4(1H)-quinolones highlights the potential for development of \"endochin-like quinolones\" (ELQ), bearing an extended trifluoroalkyl moiety at the 3-position, that exhibit selective antiplasmodial effects in the low nanomolar range and inhibitory activity against chloroquine and atovaquone-resistant parasites. Further studies of halogenated alkyl- and alkoxy-quinolones may lead to the development of safe and effective therapeutics for use in treatment or prevention of malaria and other parasitic diseases.",

A case study of the use of biomarkers and Translational Medicine in atherosclerosis drug discovery and development.",
    "abstract": "Although the relationship between HDL (high density lipoprotein) function and cardiovascular (CV) risk has been extensively explored, the premise that HDL elevation is linked to reduced CV risks and that high HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) might be a potential surrogate biomarker for reduced CV risk remains controversial. Substantial genetic, molecular, biochemical and preclinical evidence have raised the hope that HDL-C elevation via CETP inhibition might generate clinical benefits. However, four large-scale clinical trials with the CETP inhibitor torcetrapib failed to demonstrate benefits on CV clinical outcomes. Likewise, biomarkers that were supposed to predict vascular risk reduction provided disappointing results. The sad tale of torcetrapib development emphasizes the need for a paradigm shift from the conventional drug development mode to a biomarker-based Translational Medicine (TMed) strategy. Emergence of further CETP inhibitors encourage continued development of such compounds for cardiovascular risk management. However, there is a need to adopt biomarker-driven TMed strategies in target validation, target-compound interaction, pharmacodynamic activities, disease modification and patient selection to guide future drug development efforts. This commentary analyzes the issues surrounding the demise of torcetrapib and proposes a TMed-based road map towards successful development of new CETP inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by the loss of function of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-Galactosidase-A. Although two enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) are commercially available, they may not effectively reverse some of the Fabry pathology. PRX-102 is a novel enzyme for the therapy of Fabry disease expressed in a BY2 Tobacco cell culture. PRX-102 is chemically modified, resulting in a cross-linked homo-dimer. We have characterized the in-vitro and in-vivo properties of PRX-102 and compared the results with the two commercially produced alpha-Galactosidase-A enzymes. Results show that PRX-102 has prolonged in-vitro stability in plasma, after 1h incubation it retains 30% activity compared with complete inactivation of the commercial enzymes. Under lysosomal-like conditions PRX-102 maintains over 80% activity following 10 days of incubation, while commercial enzymes become inactive after 2days. Pharmacokinetic profile of PRX-102 measured in male Fabry mice shows a 10 fold increase in t1/2 in mice (581min) compared to approved drugs. The enzyme has significantly different kinetic parameters to the alternative ERTs available (p-value&lt;0.05, one way ANOVA), although these differences do not indicate any significant biochemical variations. PRX-102 is uptaken to primary human Fabry fibroblasts. The repeat administration of the enzyme to Fabry mice caused significant reduction (p-value&lt;0.05) of Gb3 in various tissues (the measured residual content was 64% in kidney, liver was cleaned, 23% in heart, 5.7% in skin and 16.2% in spleen). PRX-102 has a relatively simple glycosylation pattern, characteristic to plants, having mainly tri-mannose structures with the addition of either alpha(1-3)-linked fucose or beta(1-2)-linked xylose, or both, in addition to various high mannose structures, while agalsidase beta has a mixture of sialylated glycans in addition to high mannose structures. This study concludes that PRX-102 is equivalent in functionality to the current ERTs available, with superior stability and prolonged circulatory half-life. Therefore we propose that PRX-102 is a promising alternative for treatment of Fabry disease.",

    "abstract": "Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine, is the first benzodiazepine antagonist available for clinical use. It is a specific competitive antagonist at benzodiazepine receptors, which are associated with receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid, the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Administered orally, it has a low bioavailability and the preferred route is intravenous. Its usual clinical role is to reverse the effects of benzodiazepine sedation; however, administered before, or with, other benzodiazepines, it modifies their effects, the extent of such modification depending on the dose, duration of effect and relative receptor affinity of the agonist. Flumazenil also reverses adverse physiological effects of benzodiazepines. Its indications include reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation, termination of benzodiazepine-induced anaesthesia, return of spontaneous respiration and consciousness in intensive care patients and the treatment of paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines. Other potential indications include its use in hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol intoxication and coma; however, these claims still require substantiation. Following sedation reversed with flumazenil, minimal residual effects of the agonist can sometimes be detected using psychomotor tests and are due to the relatively short half-life of flumazenil, but are of no clinical consequence. There is concern that flumazenil could precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome following long-term benzodiazepine administration; however, the available evidence suggests otherwise and that it could be useful in the treatment of benzodiazepine tolerance. The existence of flumazenil is important, with implications for future research and the development of minimally invasive therapy and day-case surgery. With increasing pressures on non-anaesthetically trained practitioners to perform sedation, flumazenil has important implications for safety.",

    "title": "Microbiology and antimicrobial management of sinusitis.",
    "abstract": "Sinusitis generally develops as a complication of viral or allergic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. The bacterial pathogens in acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, while anaerobic bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus are predominant in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a potential pathogen in immunocompromised patients and in those who have nasal tubes or catheters, or are intubated. Many of these organisms recovered from sinusitis became resistant to penicillins either through the production of beta-lactamase (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, Fusobacterium spp., and Prevotella spp) or through changes in the penicillin-binding protein (S. pneumoniae). The pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is expressed directly through their ability to cause infections, and indirectly through the production of betalactamase. The indirect pathogenicity is conveyed not only by surviving penicillin therapy, but also by 'shielding' penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. The direct and indirect virulent characteristics of these bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. The antimicrobials that are the most effective in management of acute sinusitis are amoxycillin-clavulanate (given in a high dose), the newer quinolones (gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin) and the second generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefprozil or cefdinir). The antimicrobials that are the most effective in management of chronic sinusitis are amoxycillinclavulanate, clindamycin and the combination of metronidazole and a penicillin.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of migraine. The discovery of the 5-HT1B/1D/1F agonist sumatriptan constitutes a substantial advance in the acute treatment of migraine, though it displays a number of nonnegligible shortcomings. Today, a number of second-generation drugs derived from tryptamine are under advanced clinical development or are about to be marketed worldwide for the acute treatment of migraine. These tryptamine derivatives display partial agonist properties at 5-HT1B/1D receptors. It is not yet clearly established whether these agents represent a major improvement over sumatriptan in therapeutic effectiveness. Most of them also show affinity for 5-ht1F binding sites and have better oral pharmacokinetics than sumatriptan. The acute antimigraine effects of this second-generation of triptans seem to be obtained in largely the same way as with sumatriptan: by cranial vasoconstriction and inhibition of trigeminovascular activation from both peripheral and central projections. Future directions in migraine therapy should focus on agents that exhibit high intrinsic activity at 5-HT1B/1D receptors, offer a good safety profile, and demonstrate long-lasting action which might also be considered in migraine prophylaxis.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In this review, we explain our current understanding of the molecular basis for pain relief by capsaicin and other transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily, member 1 (TRPV1) agonists. We summarize disease-related changes in TRPV1 expression and its implications for therapy and potential adverse effects. Last, we provide an overview of the current clinical uses of topical and injectable TRPV1 agonist preparations in both oncologic and nononcologic populations. METHOD: Search of MEDLINE and other databases. RESULTS: The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 is a polymodal nociceptor exhibiting a dynamic threshold of activation that could be lowered under inflammatory conditions. Consistent with this model, TRPV1 knock-out mice are devoid of post-inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia. TRPV1 desensitization of primary sensory neurons is a powerful approach to relieve symptoms of nociceptive behavior in animal models of chronic pain. However, over-the-counter capsaicin creams have shown moderate to poor analgesic efficacy. This is in part related to low dose, poor skin absorption, and compliance factors. Recently developed site-specific capsaicin therapy with high-dose patches and injectable preparations seem to be safe and reportedly provide long-lasting analgesia with rapid onset. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that TRPV1 agonists and antagonists are not mutually exclusive but rather complimentary pharmacologic approaches for pain relief and we predict a \"revival\" for capsaicin and other TRPV1 agonists in the clinical management of pain associated with inflammation, metabolic imbalances (eg, diabetes), infections (HIV), and cancer, despite the current focus of the pharmaceutical industry on TRPV1 antagonists.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported that the 5-HT uptake blocker and releaser, dexfenfluramine, attenuates ethanol intake, and that this may be mediated via a 5-HT(2C) receptor mechanism. Our goals were to further determine the contribution made by this receptor subtype in mediating the reduction in ethanol self-administration induced by dexfenfluramine using the selective 5-HT(2C) antagonist, SB242,084. Additionally, we wanted to compare dexfenfluramine's effects on ethanol motivated responding with those elicited by the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist Ro60-0175. In male Wistar rats trained to self-administer a 12% w/v ethanol solution on an FR-4 schedule, both dexfenfluramine (0.05--2.5 mg/kg ip) and Ro60-0175 (0.1--1 mg/kg sc) produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in ethanol self-administration, which was reversed by SB242,084 (0.5 mg/kg ip). Interestingly, SB242,084 alone (0.1--1 mg/kg ip) significantly increased ethanol motivated responding in both high and low ethanol drinking animals. While dexfenfluramine had no effect on ethanol's kinetic profile, the selective 5-HT(2C) agents used had opposing effects, with the agonist Ro60-0175 decreasing and the antagonist SB242,084 increasing blood ethanol levels. Since there were incongruent drug effects on ethanol self-administration and blood ethanol levels, these data support a role for 5-HT(2C) receptors in modifying ethanol intake independent of their effects on blood ethanol kinetics. Furthermore, 5-HT(2C) receptors may exert a tonic control over ethanol self-administration behaviour, since agonist and antagonist administration had opposing effects on this behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Opioid drugs such as morphine and meperidine are widely used in clinical pain management, although they can cause some adverse effects. A number of studies indicate that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may play a role in the mechanism of morphine analgesia, tolerance and dependence. Being an antitussive with NMDA antagonist properties, dextromethorphan (DM) may have some therapeutic benefits when coadministered with morphine. In the present study, we investigated the effects of DM on the antinociceptive effects of different opioids. We also investigated the possible pharmacokinetic mechanisms involved. The antinociceptive effects of the mu-opioid receptor agonists morphine (5 mg kg(-1), s.c.), meperidine (25 mg kg(-1), s.c.) and codeine (25 mg kg(-1), s.c.), and the kappa-opioid agonists nalbuphine (8 mg kg(-1), s.c.) and U-50,488H (20 mg kg(-1), s.c.) were studied using the tail-flick test in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Coadministration of DM (20 mg kg(-1), i.p.) with these opioids was also performed and investigated. The pharmacokinetic effects of DM on morphine and codeine were examined, and the free concentration of morphine or codeine in serum was determined by HPLC.It was found that DM potentiated the antinociceptive effects of some mu-opioid agonists but not codeine or kappa-opioid agonists in rats. DM potentiated morphine's antinociceptive effect, and acutely increased the serum concentration of morphine. In contrast, DM attenuated the antinociceptive effect of codeine and decreased the serum concentration of its active metabolite (morphine). The pharmacokinetic interactions between DM and opioids may partially explain the differential effects of DM on the antinociception caused by opioids.",

The results of the enzymatic inhibition kinetics by Lineweaver-Burk analysis indicated 5HNB inhibits tyrosinase non-competitively when L-tyrosine was used as the substrate. Based on the strong inhibitory action of 5HNB, it is expected that 5HNB can suppress melanin production in which tyrosinase plays the essential role. Our expectation was confirmed by the experimentations with B16 melanoma cells in which 5HNB inhibited melanin production.

    "title": "Oral anticoagulants in development: focus on thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery.",
    "abstract": "Current anticoagulant provision is dominated by parenteral heparin and oral warfarin, which act by inhibiting several steps of the coagulation pathway indirectly. Recent research efforts have focused on the identification of small molecule inhibitors of the coagulation enzymes as novel therapies for thrombotic disorders. There has been particular success in developing nonpeptidic, orally available, small molecules to directly inhibit the key proteases, factor IIa and factor Xa. Of the new oral anticoagulants in development, the two agents in the most advanced stage are dabigatran etexilate (BIBR 1048) and rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939), which inhibit factor IIa and factor Xa, respectively. Other agents in the early stages of development include several Xa inhibitors (LY-517717, YM150, DU-176b and apixaban [BMS-562247]), a factor IXa inhibitor (TTP889), and an orally active glycosaminoglycan enhancer (odiparcil [SB-424323]), which indirectly enhances thrombin inhibition via heparin cofactor II. Results have been reported from important, phase II dose-finding studies, and a number of registration-track phase III studies have been initiated, reflecting the drive towards potentially more effective, but primarily safer and more convenient therapies for the prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thrombosis. Indeed, two unmet needs for anticoagulation that can be easily identified are safety and ease of use. Safety relates primarily to the incidence of major bleeding and this remains the key concern of orthopaedic surgeons, over and above any efficacy advantage, and convenience of use, which centres on oral administration replacing the need for injections. The clinical development of these new anticoagulants is following the well tested strategy of dose-ranging and registration studies in major orthopaedic surgery, prior to development in arterial indications. There are a number of subtle issues, including the timing of the first perioperative dose, duration of prophylactic treatment and definition/assessment of study endpoints that can influence study outcome and require careful consideration when evaluating study results with new agents and in the comparison with established agents, and which are considered in this review. It is anticipated that over the next 3 years, at least one of these agents will be successfully licensed for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after major orthopaedic surgery, which will act as a springboard for the gradual replacement of current anticoagulants.",

    "title": "Discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of Bcl-2 through structure-based computer screening.",
    "abstract": "Bcl-2 belongs to a growing family of proteins which regulates programmed cell death (apoptosis). Overexpression of Bcl-2 has been observed in 70% of breast cancer, 30-60% of prostate cancer, 80% of B-cell lymphomas, 90% of colorectal adenocarcinomas, and many other forms of cancer. Thereby, Bcl-2 is an attractive new anti-cancer target. Herein, we describe the discovery of novel classes of small-molecule inhibitors targeted at the BH3 binding pocket in Bcl-2. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of Bcl-2 has been modeled on the basis of a high-resolution NMR solution structure of Bcl-X(L), which shares a high sequence homology with Bcl-2. A structure-based computer screening approach has been employed to search the National Cancer Institute 3D database of 206 876 organic compounds to identify potential Bcl-2 small-molecule inhibitors that bind to the BH3 binding site of Bcl-2. These potential Bcl-2 small-molecule inhibitors were first tested in an in vitro binding assay for their potency in inhibition of the binding of a Bak BH3 peptide to Bcl-2. Thirty-five potential inhibitors were tested in this binding assay, and seven of them were found to have a binding affinity (IC(50) value) from 1.6 to 14.0 microM. The anti-proliferative activity of these seven active compounds has been tested using a human myeloid leukemia cell line, HL-60, which expresses the highest level of Bcl-2 protein among all the cancer cell lines examined. Compound 6 was the most potent compound and had an IC(50) value of 4 microM in inhibition of cell growth using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Five other compounds had moderate activity in inhibition of cell growth. Compound 6 was further evaluated for its ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. It was found that 6 induces apoptosis in cancer cells with high Bcl-2 expression and its potency correlates with the Bcl-2 expression level in cancer cells. Furthermore, using NMR methods, we conclusively demonstrated that 6 binds to the BH3 binding site in Bcl-X(L). Our results showed that small-molecule inhibitors of Bcl-2 such as 6 modulate the biological function of Bcl-2, and induce apoptosis in cancer cells with high Bcl-2 expression, while they have little effect on cancer cells with low or undetectable levels of Bcl-2 expression. Therefore, compound 6 can be used as a valuable pharmacological tool to elucidate the function of Bcl-2 and also serves as a novel lead compound for further design and optimization. Our results suggest that the structure-based computer screening strategy employed in the study is effective for identifying novel, structurally diverse, nonpeptide small-molecule inhibitors that target the BH3 binding site of Bcl-2.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease characterized by an elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular resistance with a poor prognosis. Various pulmonary and extrapulmonary causes are now recognized to exist separately from the idiopathic form of pulmonary hypertension. An imbalance in the presence of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators plays an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease, one example being the lack of prostacyclin. Prostacyclin and its analogues are potent vasodilators with antithrombotic, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory qualities, all of which are important factors in the pathogenesis of precapillary pulmonary hypertension. Iloprost is a stable prostacyclin analogue available for intravenous and aerosolized application. Due to the severe side effects of intravenous administration, the use of inhaled iloprost has become a mainstay in PAH therapy. However, owing to the necessity for 6 to 9 inhalations a day, oral treatment is often preferred as a first-line therapy. Numerous studies proving the efficacy and safety of inhaled iloprost have been performed. It is therefore available for a first-line therapy for PAH. The combination with endothelin-receptor antagonists or sildenafil has shown encouraging effects. Further studies with larger patient populations will have to demonstrate the use of combination therapy for long-term treatment of pulmonary hypertension.",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of death in the world. Variants in the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) gene are associated with risk of MI. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of an inhibitor of FLAP on levels of biomarkers associated with MI risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of an inhibitor of FLAP (DG-031) in MI patients who carry at-risk variants in the FLAP gene or in the leukotriene A4 hydrolase gene. Of 268 patients screened, 191 were carriers of at-risk variants in FLAP (87%) or leukotriene A4 hydrolase (13%). Individuals were enrolled in April 2004 and were followed up by designated cardiologists from a university hospital in Iceland until September 2004. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were first randomized to receive 250 mg/d of DG-031, 500 mg/d of DG-031, 750 mg/d of DG-031, or placebo. After a 2-week washout period, patients received DG-031 if they had received placebo first or placebo if they had received DG-031 first. Treatment periods lasted for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in levels of biomarkers associated with risk of MI. RESULTS: In response to 750 mg/d of DG-031, production of leukotriene B4 was significantly reduced by 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-39%; P = .003) and myeloperoxidase was significantly reduced by 12% (95% CI, 2%-21%; P = .02). The higher 2 doses of DG-031 produced a nonsignificant reduction in C-reactive protein (16%; 95% CI, -2% to 31%; P = .07) at 2 weeks. However, there was a more pronounced reduction (25%; 95% CI, 5%-40%; P = .02) in C-reactive protein at the end of the washout period that persisted for another 4 weeks thereafter. The FLAP inhibitor DG-031 was well tolerated and was not associated with any serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: In patients with specific at-risk variants of 2 genes in the leukotriene pathway, DG-031 led to significant and dose-dependent suppression of biomarkers that are associated with increased risk of MI events.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine, beside its role in the intermediate metabolism, mediates its physiological functions by interacting with four receptor subtypes named A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3). All these receptors belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors that represent the most widely targeted pharmacological protein class. Since adenosine receptors are widespread throughout the body, they are involved in a variety of physiological processes and pathology including neurological, cardiovascular, inflammatory diseases and cancer. At now, it is ascertained that the biological responses evoked by the activation of a single receptor are the result of complex and integrated signalling pathways targeted by different receptor proteins, interacting each other. These pathways may in turn control receptor responsiveness over time through fine regulatory mechanisms including desensitization-internalization processes. The knowledge of adenosine receptor structure as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of receptor functioning and of receptor-receptor interactions during physio and pathological conditions represent a pivotal starting point to the development of new drugs with high efficacy and selectivity for each adenosine receptor subtype. The goal of this review is to summarize what we now and what we are learning about adenosine receptor structure, signalling and regulatory mechanisms. In addition, to dissect the potential therapeutic application of adenosine receptor ligands, the pathophysiological role of the receptor subtypes in different tissues are discussed.",

    "abstract": "High-speed chronoamperometric recordings were used to measure the uptake and clearance of locally applied dopamine (DA) within the substantia nigra (SN) of anesthetized rats. To establish that DA clearance within the SN was mediated primarily by the DA transporter (DAT) rather than the norepinephrine transporter (NET) or the serotonin transporter (SERT), we locally applied uptake inhibitors with different selectivity profiles for the various amine transporters. Nomifensine, a DAT/NET inhibitor, significantly potentiated both the amplitude and the time course of the DA signals. In contrast, neither the selective NET inhibitor desipramine, nor the selective SERT inhibitor citalopram affected the DA signal, suggesting that NET and SERT do not contribute to DA uptake and clearance within the regions of the SN studied over the concentration ranges (1-5 microM) used. In unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, the time course of the DA signal was increased in both the lesioned SN and striatum, relative to the unlesioned hemisphere, indicating loss of DAT and decreased DA uptake and clearance. In addition, when identical amounts of DA were injected in the striatum and SN, peak signal amplitudes were larger in the SN, suggesting that the amplitudes are related to the number of DAT sites in a given region of brain tissue. For signals of equivalent amplitudes, clearance rates were lower in the SN than in the striatum, consistent with a lower capacity for DAT-mediated DA uptake within the SN. These results suggest that the DAT is the major transporter responsible for DA clearance within the rat SN.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: An investigation into whether alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists induce contractions in the porcine ciliary arteries and to characterize the functional receptor subtype mediating these responses. METHODS: Isolated arteries from the intraocular part of the porcine ciliary artery were suspended in microvascular myographs for isometric tension recording. The segments were contracted with the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists brimonidine, apraclonidine, and oxymetazoline. To determine which subtypes of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor mediate this contraction, antagonists subselective for the different alpha(2)-adrenoceptors were added to the vessel bath before concentration-response curves for brimonidine were obtained. The following alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists were applied: BRL44408 (alpha(2A)-selective), ARC239 (alpha(2B)- and alpha(2C)-selective), and prazosin (alpha(2B)- and alpha(2C)-selective). RESULTS: The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists induced vasoconstriction in the porcine ciliary artery with the following potency order (EC(50)) expressed in nanomolar: brimonidine 2.11, oxymetazoline 5.26, and apraclonidine 13.0. As a reference, noradrenaline was tested, and its EC(50) was determined to be 247 nM in the ciliary artery. In the porcine ciliary arteries BRL44408, ARC239, and prazosin caused concentration-dependent and parallel rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves for brimonidine. Schild analyses for the antagonists against brimonidine yielded regression lines with slopes of unity and functional antagonist potencies (pK(B)) for BRL44408 (7.8), ARC 239 (5.8) and for prazosin (6.0) suggesting the presence of functional alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors. Moreover, there was a good correlation of pK(B) with ligand-binding affinity (pK(i)) of the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor in the porcine eye tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists brimonidine, apraclonidine, and oxymetazoline are potent vasoconstrictors in the porcine ciliary artery. In the present work, it was shown for the first time that the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor subtype mediates this contraction.",

ABT-414 exhibits potent cytotoxicity against glioblastoma multiforme patient-derived xenograft models expressing either wild-type EGFR or EGFRvIII, with sustained regressions and cures observed at clinically relevant doses. ABT-414 also combines with standard-of-care treatment of radiation and temozolomide, providing significant therapeutic benefit in a glioblastoma multiforme xenograft model. On the basis of these results, ABT-414 has advanced to phase I/II clinical trials, and objective responses have been observed in patients with both amplified wild-type and EGFRvIII-expressing tumors.

Despite being the first antivirals described to be effective against HIV, reverse transcriptase inhibitors remain the cornerstone of HAART. There are two broad classes of reverse transcriptase inhibitor, the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Since the first such compounds were developed, viral resistance to them has inevitably been described; this necessitates the continuous development of novel compounds within each class. In this review, we consider the NRTIs and NNRTIs currently in both preclinical and clinical development or approved for second-line therapy and describe the patterns of resistance associated with their use as well as the underlying mechanisms that have been described. Due to reasons of both affordability and availability, some reverse transcriptase inhibitors with a low genetic barrier are more commonly used in resource-limited settings. Their use results in the emergence of specific patterns of antiviral resistance and so may require specific actions to preserve therapeutic options for patients in such settings.",

Recently, a new approach using a xylose-inducible plasmid to express antisense RNA in Staphylococcus aureus has been described; however, the actual mechanism was not delineated. In this paper, the mechanism of decreased target protein production by expression of antisense RNA was investigated using Northern blotting. This revealed that the antisense RNA acts posttranscriptionally by targeting mRNA, leading to 5' mRNA degradation. Using this technology, a two-plate assay was developed in order to identify FabF/FabH target-specific cell-permeable inhibitors by screening of natural product extracts. Over 250,000 natural product fermentation broths were screened and then confirmed in biochemical assays, yielding a hit rate of 0.1%. All known natural product FabH and FabF inhibitors, including cerulenin, thiolactomycin, thiotetromycin, and Tu3010, were discovered using this whole-cell mechanism-based screening approach. Phomallenic acids, which are new inhibitors of FabF, were also discovered. These new inhibitors exhibited target selectivity in the gel elongation assay and in the whole-cell-based two-plate assay. Phomallenic acid C showed good antibacterial activity, about 20-fold better than that of thiolactomycin and cerulenin, against S. aureus. It exhibited a spectrum of antibacterial activity against clinically important pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Haemophilus influenzae.",

    "title": "Isoflurane-induced depolarization of neural mitochondria increases with age.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) drives the three fundamental functions of mitochondria, namely adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation, Ca(2+) uptake/storage, and generation/detoxification of ROS. Isoflurane depolarizes neural mitochondria. The sensitivity for general anesthetics increases with age, but the mechanism for this age-related sensitivity is still unknown. We compared the effect of isoflurane on [Ca(2+)](i) and DeltaPsi(m) in isolated pre-synaptic terminals (synaptosomes) from neonatal, adolescent, and adult rats and the influence of interventions in the respiratory chain was assessed. METHODS: Synaptosomes were loaded with the fluorescent probes fura-2 ([Ca(2+)](i)) and JC-1 (DeltaPsi(m)) and exposed to isoflurane 1 and 2 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The effect on the electron transport chain was investigated by blocking complexes I and V. RESULTS: In neonatal rats isoflurane had no significant effect on DeltaPsi(m). In adolescent and adult synaptosomes, however, isoflurane 1 and 2 MAC decreased DeltaPsi(m). Isoflurane 2 MAC increased [Ca(2+)](i) in neonatal and adolescent rats, but not in adult synaptosomes. In Ca(2+)-depleted medium, isoflurane still decreased DeltaPsi(m), while [Ca(2+)](i) remained unaltered. By blocking complex V of the respiratory chain, the isoflurane-induced mitochondrial depolarization was enhanced in all age groups. Blocking complex I depolarized the mitochondria to the same extent as isoflurane 2 MAC, but without any additive effect. CONCLUSIONS: The depolarizing effect of isoflurane on neural mitochondria is more pronounced in the adolescent and adult than in neonatal synaptosomes. The increased mitochondrial sensitivity with age seems to be related to the reversed function of the ATP synthase of the electron transport chain.",

    "title": "BK channel modulators: a comprehensive overview.",
    "abstract": "The large Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (BK channel) reflects per excellence the dilemma of the molecular target driven drug discovery process. Significant experimental evidence suggests that the BK channels play a pivotal and specific role in many pathophysiological conditions supporting the notion that the channel represents an innovative and promising drug target. However, after more than ten years of intense research effort both in academia and industry, scientists have yet to witness the approval of a single BK channel modulator for clinical use. On the contrary, three BK openers that were progressed to clinical development have recently been discontinued (NS8, BMS204352 and TA1702) and, at the present time, only one drug candidate targeting BK channels (andolast) remains in the early phases of clinical development. Since biological studies keep strengthening the concept of BK channels as a potentially attractive target, the design and synthesis of potent and selective BK modulators continue based on novel chemical ideas. A comprehensive overview of BK channel modulators is therefore timely and important to the current medicinal chemist for review, summary, and classification of the multitude of chemical entities claimed to be BK-modulating agents. Such chemical entities are, herein, classified by both origin and chemical structure in 1) Endogenous BK channel modulators and structural analogues 2) Naturally-occurring BK channel inhibitors and blockers 3) Synthetic BK channel inhibitors and blockers 4) Marketed and/or investigational drugs with BK-modulating side properties and structural analogues 5) Naturally-occurring BK channel openers and structural analogues 6) Synthetic BK channel openers. This review is intended to provide readers with current opinion on the BK channel as a drug target, the chemical structures of BK channel modulators, the structural and chemical features involved in the BK channel modulating activity and, where and when possible, with highlights of structure-activity relationships.",

The compounds showed a high rate of COX-1 inhibition with the most potent compounds exhibiting submicromolar IC(50) values and high selectivity indices. A prediction model for COX-inhibiting activity was also developed using the classical LIE approach resulting in consistent docking data for our molecule sample.

    "abstract": "We investigated the actions of the organoborane, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2APB), on Ca2+ signaling in wild-type human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and in HEK293 cells stably expressing canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels. Previous reports have suggested that 2APB inhibits agonist activation of TRPC channels because of its ability to act as a membrane-permeant inhibitor of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors. 2APB was specifically said to inhibit TRPC3 channels when activated through a phospholipase C-linked receptor but not when activated more directly by a synthetic diacylglycerol, oleyl-acetyl-glycerol (OAG) [Science (Wash DC) 287:1647-1651, 2000]. However, we subsequently reported that IP3 does not activate TRPC3; rather the mechanism of activation by phospholipase C-linked receptors seemed to result from diacylglycerol [J Biol Chem 278:16244-16252, 2003]. Thus, the current study was carried out to address the mechanism of action of 2APB in inhibiting TRPC channels. We found that, although the release of Ca2+ by a muscarinic agonist was reduced by high concentrations of 2APB, this effect was indistinguishable from that seen when stores were discharged by thapsigargin, which does not involve IP3 receptors. This indicates that 2APB is incapable of significant inhibition of IP3 receptors when applied to intact cells. We found that 2APB partially inhibits divalent cation entry in cells expressing TRPC3, TRPC6, or TRPC7 and that this partial inhibition was observed whether the channels were activated by a muscarinic agonist or by OAG. Thus, as concluded for store-operated channels, 2APB seems to inhibit TRPC channels by a direct mechanism not involving IP3 receptors.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the potency and the selectivity profile of vardenafil on phosphodiesterase (PDEs) enzymes, its ability to modify cGMP metabolism and cause relaxation of penile smooth muscle and its effect on erections in vivo under conditions of exogenous nitric oxide (NO) stimulation. PDE isozymes were extracted and purified from human platelets (PDE5) or bovine sources (PDEs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6). The inhibition of these PDEs and of human recombinant PDEs by vardenafil was determined. The ability to potentiate NO-mediated relaxation and influence cGMP levels in human corpus cavernosum strips was measured in vitro, and erection-inducing activity was demonstrated in conscious rabbits after oral administration together with intravenous doses of sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The effects of vardenafil were compared with those of the well-recognized PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (values for sildenafil in brackets). Vardenafil specifically inhibited the hydrolysis of cGMP by PDE5 with an IC50 of 0.7 nM (6.6 nM). In contrast, the IC50 of vardenafil for PDE1 was 180 nM; for PDE6, 11 nM; for PDE2, PDE3 and PDE4, more than 1000 nM. Relative to PDE5, the ratios of the IC50 for PDE1 were 257 (60), for PDE6 16 (7.4). Vardenafil significantly enhanced the SNP-induced relaxation of human trabecular smooth muscle at 3 nM (10 nM). Vardenafil also significantly potentiated both ACh-induced and transmural electrical stimulation-induced relaxation of trabecular smooth muscle. The minimum concentration of vardenafil that significantly potentiated SNP-induced cGMP accumulation was 3 nM (30 nM). In vivo studies in rabbits showed that orally administered vardenafil dose-dependently potentiated erectile responses to intravenously administered SNP. The minimal effective dose that significantly potentiated erection was 0.1 mg/kg (1 mg/kg). The selectivity for PDE5, the potentiation of NO-induced relaxation and cGMP accumulation in human trabecular smooth muscle and the ability to enhance NO-induced erection in vivo indicate that vardenafil has the appropriate properties to be a potential compound for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Vardenafil was more potent and selective than sildenafil on its inhibitory activity on PDE5.",

    "abstract": "Leflunomide, a novel drug with proven efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis, is an isoxazol derivative structurally unrelated to other immunomodulatory drugs. Leflunomide is rapidly metabolized to its active form, A77 1726. Two mechanisms of action have been identified for A77 1726: inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and inhibition of tyrosine kinases. DHODH inhibition occurs at lower concentrations of A77 1726 than that of tyrosine kinases and is currently considered the major mode of action. Stimulated lymphocytes must increase ribonucleotide levels from 8 to 16-fold before proceeding from the G1 into the S phase. Increased levels of ribonucleotides can only be met by de novo ribonucleotide synthesis. At low levels of ribonucleotides, p53, a \"sensor\" molecule, gets activated and prevents progression through the cell cycle. Therefore, an inhibitor of de novo uridine monophosphate synthesis would predictably arrest stimulated cells at the G1 phase. In support of this mechanism of action, in vitro mitogen stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with A77 1726 undergo arrest at the G1 phase; this inhibition is reversed by uridine.",

ALK, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, and ROS1 are RTKs involved in several canonical pathways related to oncogenesis. These proteins can be genetically altered in malignancies, leading to receptor activation and constitutive signaling through their respective downstream pathways. Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood, and despite intensive therapy, there is a high mortality rate in cases with a high-risk disease. Alterations of ALK and differential expression of TRK proteins are reported in a proportion of NB. Several inhibitors of ALK or TRKA/B/C have been evaluated both preclinically and clinically in the treatment of NB. These agents have had variable success and are not routinely used in the treatment of NB. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is a pan-ALK, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, and ROS1 inhibitor with activity against tumors with ALK, NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, and ROS1 alterations in Phase I clinical trials in adults.

The present study demonstrates the efficacy of Tregs pharmacologically induced in vivo in GVHD prevention. A single i.v. administration of a liposomal formulation of alpha-galactosylceramide (RGI-2001) at the time of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with spleen cells significantly prolonged the survival of mice experiencing lethal acute GVHD. RGI-2001 expanded donor-derived CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow in a dose-dependent manner. On day 15 posttransplantation, the spleens of mice treated with RGI-2001 (1 mug/kg) contained 5-fold higher percentages or 10-fold higher numbers of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs compared with the spleens of untreated mice. Host-specific immunosuppression was introduced in treated mice, whereas the responsiveness to third-party alloantigens and leukemia cells was maintained. Using Foxp3:GFP reporter mice as donors, it was clearly shown that RGI-2001 expanded the pre-existing naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs) in donor spleen cells. Finally, RGI-2001 synergized with a subtherapeutic dose of rapamycin in nTreg expansion and further prolonged survival. Our results provide the first demonstration of the efficacy of nTregs pharmacologically expanded in vivo in preventing acute GVHD without abrogation of the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effect.",

JTP-4819 was shown to be a very potent and specific inhibitor of PEP. At nanomolar concentration, JTP-4819 inhibited the degradation of substance P, arginine-vasopressin, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone by PEP in supernatants of the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Repeated administration of JTP-4819 reversed the aging-induced decrease in brain substance P-like and thyrotropin-releasing hormone-like immunoreactivity, suggesting that this drug may be able to improve the imbalance of peptidergic neuronal systems that develops with senescense by inhibiting PEP activity. JTP-4819 increased acetylcholine release from the frontal cortex and hippocampus, regions closely associated with memory, in both young and aged rats. In addition, it improved performance in several memory and learning-related tests (e.g., the Morris water maze task in aged or MCA-occluded rats and the passive avoidance test). This memory-enhancing effect of JTP-4819 may result from prevention of the metabolic degradation of brain neuropeptides by PEP as well as from the enhancement of acetylcholine release. Taken together, these unique and potent pharmacological actions of JTP-4819 suggest that it may have the potential to be used for treating Alzheimer's disease.",

METHODS: Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerance of zifrosilone were studied in a double-blind, sequential, single-escalating-dose, randomized panel design. Each panel consisted of six subjects, with four subjects receiving zifrosilone (10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mg orally) and two subjects receiving matching placebo.

Participating subjects (n = 54) were men between the ages of 18 and 45 years. Each subject had a normal physical examination, electrocardiogram, serum chemistries, hematology, urinalysis, and test for human immunodeficiency virus at screening. RESULTS: A greater than proportionate increase in mean plasma concentration values for area under the curve from time zero to infinity was observed over the 200 to 300 mg dose range groups. Red blood cell acetylcholinesterase showed a dose-inhibition relationship, with a mean maximum inhibition of 20.9% at 10 mg that increased to 62.1% at 300 mg.

METHODS: Investigate the effect of 5-LOX/COX-2 dual inhibitor DHDMBF30 on proliferation and apoptosis of the pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-2 by RT-PCR, MTT assay, FCM and electron microscope. Cell line Capan-2 was inoculated percutaneously on the outer thigh of 12 nude mice. The VEGF mRNA of transplantation tumor was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: DHDMBF30 inhibits the proliferation of cell line Capan2, reduces the expression of 5-LOX, COX-2 and VEGF. After Capan2 was treated with DHDMBF30, we found that the apoptosis peak of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the contrast group (3.08 +/- 1.89 vs 27.67 +/- 0.52, P &lt; 0.001). The tumor weight of the DHDMBF30 group was significantly lower than PBS control groups (1.35 +/- 0.47 vs 2.92 +/- 0.73, P &lt; 0.01). Expression of VEGF in the DHDMBF30 group was significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: DHDMBF30 inhibits the proliferation of the pancreatic cell line Capan2, and induces apoptosis and inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer in nude mice.",

    "abstract": "Metformin is a commonly used anti-diabetic but whether its mechanism involves action on the insulin receptor or on downstream events is still controversial. With a time course that was slow compared with insulin action, metformin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the regulatory domain of the insulin receptor (specifically, tyrosine residues 1150 and 1151). In a direct action, therapeutic levels of metformin stimulated the tyrosine kinase activity of the soluble intracellular portion of the beta subunit of the human insulin receptor toward a substrate derived from the insulin receptor regulatory domain. However, metformin did not alter the order of substrate phosphorylation by the insulin receptor kinase. Using a Xenopus oocyte preparation, we simultaneously recorded tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities that regulate the insulin receptor by measuring the tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of peptides derived from the regulatory domain of the human insulin receptor. In an indirect stimulation of the insulin receptor, metformin inhibited endogenous tyrosine phosphatases and purified human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B that dephosphorylate and inhibit the insulin receptor kinase. Thus, there was evidence that metformin acted directly upon the insulin receptor and indirectly through inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases.",

The current discussion is focused on studies using CCRF-CEM leukemia cells that were designed to compare and contrast mechanisms of action of the antifolates methotrexate, which is primarily a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, raltitrexed, a thymidylate synthase inhibitor, LY309887, a glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase inhibitor, and MTA (multitargeted antifolate), which is a novel antifolate antimetabolite.

    "title": "Valdecoxib: a review.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and related agents are nonselective inhibitors of both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2, which catalyze prostaglandin synthesis. This inhibition accounts not only for the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects of these agents, but also for side effects such as gastric mucosal damage and renal toxicity. Substantial evidence suggests that sparing COX-1 is advantageous for gastric safety. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews available information on the new COX-2-selective inhibitor valdecoxib, including its clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, potential drug interactions, and contraindications and warnings. Results of clinical trials of efficacy and tolerability are summarized. METHODS: Articles for inclusion in this review were identified through searches of PubMed and MEDLINE (1966-December 2002) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-December 2002). Search terms included valdecoxib, Bextra, COX-2-selective inhibitors, coxibs, and selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors. The reference lists of identified articles were reviewed for additional publications. Product information was also obtained from the manufacturer of valdecoxib. RESULTS: Fourteen clinical studies involving &gt; 4000 patients have been conducted. Valdecoxib was significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of adult rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea, and postoperative pain. Valdecoxib was comparable to naproxen for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 1 study and equivalent to naproxen for the treatment of osteoarthritis in other studies. Three studies found valdecoxib comparable to naproxen sodium for the relief of moderate to severe pain due to primary dysmenorrhea, and others found valdecoxib comparable to oxycodone plus acetaminophen and significantly more effective than rofecoxib for the relief of pain associated with dental surgery (P &lt; 0.05). Four safety studies and 2 reviews of clinical trials documented lower rates of endoscopic gastroduodenal ulcer formation with valdecoxib compared with ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac (P &lt; 0.001 to P &lt; 0.05). Valdecoxib did not inhibit platelet function (bleeding time and platelet aggregation) in healthy adults or in the elderly. Due to the risk of potentially serious skin and allergic reactions, patients who are allergic to sulfa-containing drugs should not take valdecoxib. The drug should be discontinued immediately if rash develops. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical trials, valdecoxib was effective for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and moderate to severe pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea. As with the other COX-2-selective inhibitors (celecoxib and rofecoxib), valdecoxib appears to produce less gastrointestinal toxicity than conventional nonselective NSAIDs, although some of the relevant clinical studies have been published only as abstracts. Use of valdecoxib should be reserved for patients at risk for NSAID-induced gastrointestinal problems.",

    "title": "Calpain in the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury: neuroprotection with calpain inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) evokes an increase in intracellular free Ca(2+) level resulting in activation of calpain, a Ca(2+)-dependent cysteine protease, which cleaves many cytoskeletal and myelin proteins. Calpain is widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and regulated by calpastatin, an endogenous calpain-specific inhibitor. Calpastatin degraded by overactivation of calpain after SCI may lose its regulatory efficiency. Evidence accumulated over the years indicates that uncontrolled calpain activity mediates the degradation of many cytoskeletal and membrane proteins in the course of neuronal death and contributes to the pathophysiology of SCI. Cleavage of the key cytoskeletal and membrane proteins by calpain is an irreversible process that perturbs the integrity and stability of CNS cells leading to cell death. Calpain in conjunction with caspases, most notably caspase-3, can cause apoptosis of the CNS cells following trauma. Aberrant Ca(2+) homeostasis following SCI inevitably activates calpain, which has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of SCI. Therefore, calpain appears to be a potential therapeutic target in SCI. Substantial research effort has been focused upon the development of highly specific inhibitors of calpain and caspase-3 for therapeutic applications. Administration of cell permeable and specific inhibitors of calpain and caspase-3 in experimental animal models of SCI has provided significant neuroprotection, raising the hope that humans suffering from SCI may be treated with these inhibitors in the near future.",

    "abstract": "This review focuses on the discovery of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) and the ensuing discovery of NAP (davunetide) toward clinical development with emphasis on microtubule protection. ADNP immunoreactivity was shown to occasionally decorate microtubules and ADNP silencing inhibited neurite outgrowth as measured by microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) labeling. ADNP knockout is lethal, while 50% reduction in ADNP (ADNP haploinsufficiency) resulted in the microtubule associated protein tau pathology coupled to cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration. NAP (davunetide), an eight amino acid peptide derived from ADNP partly ameliorated deficits associated with ADNP deficiency. NAP (davunetide) interacted with microtubules, protected against microtubule toxicity associated with zinc, nocodazole and oxidative stress in vitro and against tau pathology and MAP6 (stable tubuleonly polypeptide - STOP) pathology in vivo. NAP (davunetide) provided neurotrophic functions promoting neurite outgrowth as measured by increases in MAP2 immunoreactivity and synapse formation by increasing synaptophysin expression. NAP (davunetide) protection against neurodegeneration has recently been shown to extend to katanin-related microtubule disruption under conditions of tau deficiencies. In conclusion, NAP (davunetide) provided potent neuroprotection in a broad range of neurodegenerative models, protecting the neuroglial cytoskeleton in vitro and inhibiting tau pathology (tauopathy) in vivo. Based on these extensive preclinical results, davunetide (NAP) is now being evaluated in a Phase II/III study of the tauopathy, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP); (Allon Therapeutics Inc.).",

Stable hybrids have also been formed between phosphorylase subunits containing the active cofactor pyridoxal-phosphate and inactive analogs (pyridoxalphosphate monomethylester or the corresponding reduced compounds). After complete dissociation to monomers, the Sepharose-bound phosphorylase had a residual activity of less than 3% of that of the original matrix-bound dimeric enzyme. The hybrid enzyme is composed of a potentially active subunit containing pyridoxal-phosphate and an intrinsically inactive subunit carrying the analog, and it had half the activity of the original dimeric enzyme.

    "abstract": "Many lead compounds bind to serum albumin and exhibit markedly reduced efficacy in vivo as compared to their potency in vitro. To aid in the design of compounds with reduced albumin binding, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structural and binding studies on the complex between domain III of human serum albumin (HSA-III) and diflunisal, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor with antiinflammatory activity. The structural studies indicate that the aromatic rings of diflunisal are involved in extensive and specific interactions with hydrophobic residues that comprise the binding pocket in subdomain IIIA. The carboxylic acid of diflunisal forms electrostatic interactions with the protein similar to those observed in the X-ray structure of HSA complexed to myristic acid. In addition to the structural studies, NMR-derived binding constants were obtained for diflunisal and closely related analogues to develop a structure-affinity relationship for binding to subdomain IIIA. On the basis of the structural and binding data, compounds were synthesized that exhibit more than a 100-fold reduction in binding to domain III of HSA, and nearly a 10-fold reduction in affinity for full length albumin. Significantly, several of these compounds maintain activity against cyclooxygenase-2. These results suggest a rational strategy for designing out albumin binding in potential drug molecules by using structure-based design in conjunction with NMR-based screening.",

Rats pretreated with lisuride developed tolerance to its anorexigenic and hypothermic effects, and reverse tolerance to its effects on locomotor activity, stereotyped and mounting behaviour. Pretreatment with lisuride did not modify the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver.

    "abstract": "The traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are essential components of alternative medicines. Many TCMs are known to alter the expression of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. The molecular mechanism by which TCMs and/or their constituents regulate enzyme and transporter expression, however, has remained largely unknown. In this report, we show that two TCMs, Wu Wei Zi (Schisandra chinensis Baill) and Gan Cao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch), and their selected constituents activate the xenobiotic orphan nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR). Treatment with TCM extracts and the Schisandrol and Schisandrin constituents of Wu Wei Zi induced the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in reporter gene assays and in primary hepatocyte cultures. The affected enzymes and transporters include CYP3A and 2C isozymes and the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2. In transient transfection and reporter gene assays, the Schisandrin constituents of Wu Wei Zi had an estimated EC50 of 2 and 1.25 microM on hPXR and mPXR, respectively. Interestingly, mutations that were intended to alter the pore of the ligand-binding cavity of PXR had species-specific effects on the activities of the individual Schisandrols and Schisandrins. In rats, the administration of Wu Wei Zi and Gan Cao increased the metabolism of the coadministered warfarin, reinforcing concerns involving the safe use of herbal medicines and other nutraceuticals to avoid PXR-mediated drug-drug interactions. Meanwhile, the activation of PXR and induction of detoxifying enzymes provide a molecular mechanism for the hepatoprotective effects of certain TCMs.",

Whether the therapeutic effects of ATX are due to inhibition of either or both transporters is not known. Here we report our comparative PET imaging studies with [(11)C]MRB (a NET ligand) and [(11)C]AFM (a SERT ligand) to evaluate in vivo IC50 values of ATX in monkeys. METHODS: Rhesus monkeys were scanned up to four times with each tracer with up to four doses of ATX. ATX or saline (placebo) infusion began 2h before each PET scan, lasting until the end of the 2-h scan. The final infusion rates were 0.01-0.12mg/kg/h and 0.045-1.054mg/kg/h for the NET and SERT studies, respectively. ATX plasma levels and metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were measured. Distribution volumes (VT) and IC50 values were estimated. RESULTS: ATX displayed dose-dependent occupancy on both NET and SERT, with a higher occupancy on NET: IC50 of 31+-10 and 99+-21ng/mL plasma for NET and SERT, respectively. At a clinically relevant dose (1.0-1.8mg/kg, approx. 300-600ng/mL plasma), ATX would occupy &gt;90% of NET and &gt;85% of SERT. This extrapolation assumes comparable free fraction of ATX in humans and non-human primates. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that ATX at clinically relevant doses greatly occupies both NET and SERT. Thus, therapeutic modes of ATX action for treatment of depression and ADHD may be more complex than selective blockade of NET.",

    "abstract": "Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressant used for the prophylaxis of rejection in renal, pancreas, and liver transplantation. It inhibits the inducible isoform of the enzyme inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH II) via its active metabolite mycophenolic acid (MPA). IMPDH II is necessary for de novo purine synthesis in activated lymphocytes. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the feasibility of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) quantitative assessment of IMPDH II gene expression in liver transplant recipients as well as to provide a preliminary evaluation of possible correlations with drug tolerability. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of liver recipients after at least 6 months of MMF administration. IMPDH II gene expression was assessed using quantitative, real-time PCR and normalized using glyceraldheyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Finally, adverse events associated with MMF administration were recorded. Real-time PCR quantitation of IMPDH II gene expression was reliable, sensitive, and specific. The intrapatient variability for both IMPDH II and GAPDH assays was lower than 0.6% in all patients. The results demonstrated a wide interpatient variability, with the mean value +/- standard deviation of 0.949 +/- 0.525 (95% confidence interval, 0.669-1.229) and a median value of 0.797. Patients with treatment-related toxicities displayed a trend to a higher level of IMPDH II expression than those without toxicity (mean, 1.126 vs 0.771). In conclusion, pharmacogenetic analysis of IMPDH II may represent a novel approach to MMF therapeutic monitoring.",

    "title": "Paradoxical effect of sibutramine on autonomic cardiovascular regulation.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sibutramine, a serotonin and norepinephrine transporter blocker, is widely used as an adjunctive obesity treatment. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition with sibutramine conceivably could exacerbate arterial hypertension and promote cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 11 healthy subjects (7 men, age 27+/-2 years, body mass index 23.1+/-0.7 kg/m2), we compared the effect of sibutramine or matching placebo (ingested 26, 14, and 2 hours before testing) on cardiovascular responses to autonomic reflex tests and to a graded head-up tilt test. In addition, we tested sibutramine in combination with metoprolol. Testing was conducted in a double-blind and crossover fashion. Supine systolic blood pressure was 113+/-3 mm Hg with placebo, 121+/-3 mm Hg with sibutramine (P&lt;0.001 versus placebo), and 111+/-2 mm Hg with the combination of sibutramine and metoprolol. Similarly, sibutramine increased upright blood pressure. Sibutramine substantially increased upright heart rate. This effect was abolished with metoprolol. The blood pressure response to cold pressor and handgrip testing was attenuated with sibutramine compared with placebo. Furthermore, sibutramine decreased low-frequency oscillations of blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine concentrations in the supine position. CONCLUSIONS: The cardiovascular effect of the antiobesity drug sibutramine results from a complex interaction of peripheral and central nervous system effects. The inhibitory clonidine-like action of sibutramine on the central nervous system attenuates the peripheral stimulatory effect. Our findings strongly suggest that current concepts regarding the action of sibutramine on the sympathetic nervous system should be reconsidered.",

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, parallel-arm study. Setting. General clinical research center. PATIENTS: Twenty-five beta-blocker-naive adults with New York Heart Association functional classes II or III heart failure (i.e., ACC stage C). Intervention. Patients received either immediate-release carvedilol 3.125 mg twice/day or controlled-release metoprolol succinate 25 mg once/day; doses were titrated upward by doubling the dose every 2 weeks until reaching a maximum tolerated dose or a goal dose of carvedilol 25 mg twice/day and metoprolol 200 mg/day. Before each dose titration, terbutaline (a beta-receptor agonist) was infused at 6 mg/kg over 1 hour for determination of beta(2)-blockade. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were studied at baseline and after each dose titration of metoprolol succinate (at 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg once/day) and immediate-release carvedilol (at 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg twice/day). Glucose and potassium concentrations were measured twice serially at baseline, every 10 minutes during infusion, every 15 minutes for the first hour after infusion, and every 30 minutes for the second hour after infusion. The median area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was calculated for changes in glucose and potassium concentrations. As assessed by glucose AUC, there was no significant difference in the degree of beta(2)-blockade between metoprolol 200 mg and carvedilol 25 mg. In contrast to these data, the degree of beta(2)-blockade as assessed by potassium AUC was greater for carvedilol compared with metoprolol across all doses. CONCLUSION: In this ACC stage C heart failure population, carvedilol was nonselective at all clinically relevant doses, whereas metoprolol succinate was beta(1)-selective at low doses and became progressively nonselective at higher doses.",

    "abstract": "Activated vitamin D continues to be the major treatment for suppressing parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in dialysis patients who have secondary hyperparathyroidism. Active vitamin D compounds are distinguished by their ability to bind with high affinity to vitamin D receptors (VDRs) not only in the parathyroid glands, but in cells throughout the body. Because of recent data showing that pulsatile, intravenous vitamin D treatment (calcitriol or paricalcitol) confers a survival advantage in the dialysis population, there is new interest in understanding the systemic effects of VDR activation, particularly in the predialysis stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), where high mortality rates from cardiovascular disease have recently been documented. Previous underutilization of calcitriol treatment to control PTH levels in stages 3 and 4 CKD was often due to concerns about its potential for accelerating the progression of CKD as a consequence of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or hyperphosphatemia. Vitamin D analogs with selective VDR activity (such as paricalcitol) have great potential for preventing parathyroid hyperplasia and bone loss in early CKD without adversely affecting kidney function. Whether they also reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in early CKD, as they appear to do in dialysis patients, remains to be determined.",

The animals remained free of serologic and biochemical evidence of hepatitis during a 6-month follow-up period, and were then shown to be susceptible to infection by challenge with the original untreated inocula. To assess the effect of exposure to Tween 80/ether on coagulation factors, four lots of antihemophilic factor (AHF) concentrate and 2 lots of commercial factor IX concentrate were treated as above. For the AHF concentrate there was an average of 70% recovery of factor VIII procoagulant activity, 93% recovery of factor VIII-related antigen, and 73% recovery of fibronectin opsonin activity and no detectable change in ristocetin cofactor activity or in fibronectin antigen. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed no change in migration rate of fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor (vWF), although the quantity of fibrinogen was reduced. Factor VIII procoagulant activity and vWF activity remained associated during chromatography on BioGel A15.",

    "title": "Deorphanization of GPRC6A: a promiscuous L-alpha-amino acid receptor with preference for basic amino acids.",
    "abstract": "One of the most important tasks of molecular pharmacology is the deorphanization of the large number of G-protein-coupled receptors with unidentified endogenous agonists. We recently reported the cloning and analysis of expression of a novel human family C G-protein-coupled receptor, termed hGPRC6A. To identify agonists at this orphan receptor, we faced the challenges of achieving surface expression in mammalian cell lines and establishing an appropriate functional assay. Generating a chimeric receptor construct, h6A/5.24, containing the ligand binding amino-terminal domain (ATD) of hGPRC6A with the signal transducing transmembrane and C terminus of the homologous goldfish 5.24 receptor allowed us to overcome these obstacles. Homology modeling of the hGPRC6A ATD based on the crystal structure of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 predicted interaction with alpha-amino acids and was employed to rationally select potential ligands. Measurement of Ca2+-dependent chloride currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes facilitated the deorphanization of h6A/5.24 and identification of L-alpha-amino acids as agonists. The most active agonists were basic L-alpha-amino acids, L-Arg, L-Lys, and L-ornithine, suggesting that these may function as endogenous signaling molecules. Measurement of intracellular calcium in tsA cells expressing h6A/5.24 allowed determination of EC50 values, which confirmed the agonist preferences observed in oocytes. Cloning, cell surface expression and deorphanization of the mouse ortholog further reinforces the assignment of the agonist preferences of hGPRC6A. This study demonstrates the utility of a chimeric receptor approach in combination with molecular modeling, for elucidating agonist interaction with GPRC6A, a novel family C G-protein-coupled receptor.",

SAR studies indicate that quite large structural variations can be performed on KIN59 without compromising TPase inhibition. Thus, incorporation of a cyclopropylmethyl or a cyclohexylmethyl group at position N(1) of 5'-O-tritylinosine increases the inhibitory activity against TPase 10-fold compared to KIN59. Moreover, the trityl group at the 5'-position of the ribose seems to be crucial for TPase inhibition. The here reported results further substantiate that 5'-O-trityl nucleosides represent a new class of TPase inhibitors that should be further explored in those biological systems where TPase plays an instrumental role (i.e. angiogenesis).",

    "title": "Emerging role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer: a review.",
    "abstract": "Advanced and metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Only a very small number of patients survive long term after immunotherapy. However, any effect of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and/or interferon on median overall survival is small, and treatment-associated toxicities may be severe. The disease is therefore an area of high unmet medical need. Activation of the VEGF and EGF/RAS/RAF/MAP kinase pathways is frequent in solid tumours such as RCC. Such activation is implicated in tumour angiogenesis and proliferation. VEGF and EGF receptors and molecules (such as RAF kinase) involved in downstream signalling are therefore potential appropriate targets for drug therapy. Several antibodies and low molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have completed phase II clinical trials. Phase II studies of multitargeted agents, which include inhibition of VEGFR tyrosine kinase in their repertoire (sorafenib, sunitinib and AG 013736), show clear second-line activity in metastatic RCC. The same is true of the anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab. In a randomised phase III comparison against placebo in pretreated patients, sorafenib doubled median progression free survival (24 versus 12 weeks). Studies now in progress will determine whether benefits seen second-line will also be evident first-line, and whether the activity of novel agents can be increased by combining them with each other, with cytokines, or with chemotherapy.",

    "title": "A paradoxical effect of hydralazine on prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase activities in cultured human skin fibroblasts.",
    "abstract": "The effect of hydralazine on several parameters of collagen biosynthesis has been studied in cultured human skin fibroblasts. Cells treated with hydralazine synthesized procollagen which was severely deficient in hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, indicating inhibition of prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase reactions in the cell. Assays of prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase activities, however, revealed markedly increased levels in hydralazine-treated cells. The stimulatory effect of hydralazine could not be simulated in cell extracts, demonstrating its requirement for intact cells. The effect occurred slowly over a period of 96 h and was dependent on hydralazine concentration between 10 and 100 microM. This phenomenon was also observed in lysyl hydroxylase-deficient mutants. In both normal and mutant cells the relative magnitude of the hydralazine effect could be modified by ascorbic acid in the culture medium. Ascorbic acid increased the response of prolyl hydroxylase to hydralazine from 1.5- to 2-fold to 3- to 7-fold, whereas it decreased the response of lysyl hydroxylase to hydralazine from 4- to 8-fold to 2- to 3-fold. Total collagen synthesis was substantially reduced in hydralazine-treated cells; the time course and the dose-response relationship were similar to those observed for the hydroxylases. alpha, alpha'-Dipyridyl, an iron chelator, mimicked these effects of hydralazine. The studies suggest the existence in cultured cells of a compensatory mechanism for overproduction of these crucial enzymes in collagen biosynthesis, a mechanism which remains functional in cells derived from patients afflicted with hydroxylysine-deficient collagen disease.",

    "title": "Novel CYP17 inhibitors: synthesis, biological evaluation, structure-activity relationships and modelling of methoxy- and hydroxy-substituted methyleneimidazolyl biphenyls.",
    "abstract": "Recently, the steroidal CYP17 inhibitor Abiraterone entered phase II clinical trial for the treatment of androgen-dependent prostate cancer. As 17alpha-hydroxylase-17,20-lyase (CYP17) catalyzes the last step in androgen biosynthesis, inhibition of this target should affect not only testicular but also adrenal androgen formation. Therefore CYP17 inhibitors should be advantageous over existing therapies, for example with GnRH analogues. However, steroidal drugs are known for side effects which are due to affinities for steroid receptors. Therefore we decided to synthesize non-steroidal compounds mimicking the natural CYP17 substrates pregnenolone and progesterone. The synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of 15 novel and highly active non-steroidal CYP17 inhibitors are reported. The compounds were prepared via Suzuki-cross-coupling, Grignard reaction and CDI-assisted S(N)t-reaction with imidazole and their inhibitory activity was examined with recombinant human CYP17 expressed in Escherichia coli. Promising compounds were further tested for their selectivity against the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4 and the glucocorticoid-forming enzyme CYP11B1. All compounds turned out to be potent CYP17 inhibitors.

Most compounds also showed higher selectivities than Ketoconazole, but turned out to be less selective than Abiraterone.

    "abstract": "A novel nortriterpene, termed correolide, purified from the tree Spachea correae, inhibits Kv1.3, a Shaker-type delayed rectifier potassium channel present in human T lymphocytes. Correolide inhibits 86Rb+ efflux through Kv1.3 channels expressed in CHO cells (IC50 86 nM; Hill coefficient 1) and displays a defined structure-activity relationship. Potency in this assay increases with preincubation time and with time after channel opening. Correolide displays marked selectivity against numerous receptors and voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Although correolide is most potent as a Kv1.3 inhibitor, it blocks all other members of the Kv1 family with 4-14-fold lower potency. C20-29-[3H]dihydrocorreolide (diTC) was prepared and shown to bind in a specific, saturable, and reversible fashion (Kd = 11 nM) to a single class of sites in membranes prepared from CHO/Kv1.3 cells. The molecular pharmacology and stoichiometry of this binding reaction suggest that one diTC site is present per Kv1.3 channel tetramer. This site is allosterically coupled to peptide and potassium binding sites in the pore of the channel. DiTC binding to human brain synaptic membranes identifies channels composed of other Kv1 family members. Correolide depolarizes human T cells to the same extent as peptidyl inhibitors of Kv1.3, suggesting that it is a candidate for development as an immunosuppressant. Correolide is the first potent, small molecule inhibitor of Kv1 series channels to be identified from a natural product source and will be useful as a probe for studying potassium channel structure and the physiological role of such channels in target tissues of interest.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of a new vasodilator-cardiotonic agent, 349U85 hydrochloride [6-piperidino-2(1H)-quinolinone hydrochloride], in healthy male subjects. METHODS: This randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial was conducted at a university-based clinical research center among 27 healthy male subjects. Data measurements used in the study included cardiac index, supine and standing blood pressure, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography, and 12-lead electrocardiography. RESULTS: Doses from 2 mg to 250 mg were well tolerated. Cardiac index, supine heart rate, and orthostatic hypotension, indicators of inotropic, chronotropic, and vasodilator effects, respectively, correlated to plasma concentrations of 349U85 and of its metabolite, 661U88. Results suggest that 349U85 may be more responsible for inotropic effects, whereas 661U88 may be more responsible for vasodilatory and chronotropic effects. These results are consistent with the preclinical pharmacologic profile for these two compounds. Headache, orthostatic dizziness, and hypotension tended to occur more frequently at higher doses and were temporally related to drug administration. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicate nonlinearity of 349U85 and 661U88, suggestive of saturation of metabolism and large interindividual variability in maximum plasma drug concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve. The source of the variability is not known. The time to maximum distribution was approximately 0.7 hours for both 349U85 and 661U88; the terminal elimination half-life was 1 hour for 349U85 and 3 hours for 661U88. Holter monitoring revealed asymptomatic increases in ventricular and supraventricular ectopic activity in some volunteers; ectopy appeared to be related to the dose of 349U85 and generally occurred at higher doses.",

    "abstract": "Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the rate-determining step in the biosynthesis of polyamines. ODC is a proven drug target to treat African sleeping sickness. The x-ray crystal structure of Trypanosoma brucei ODC in complex with d-ornithine (d-Orn), a substrate analog, and G418 (Geneticin), a weak non-competitive inhibitor, was determined to 2.5-A resolution. d-Orn forms a Schiff base with PLP, and the side chain is in a similar position to that observed for putrescine and alpha-difluoromethylornithine in previous T. brucei ODC structures. The d-Orn carboxylate is positioned on the solvent-exposed side of the active site (si face of PLP), and Gly-199, Gly-362, and His-197 are the only residues within 4.2 A of this moiety. This structure confirms predictions that the carboxylate of d-Orn binds on the si face of PLP, and it supports a model in which the carboxyl group of the substrate l-Orn would be buried on the re face of the cofactor in a pocket that includes Phe-397, Tyr-389, Lys-69 (methylene carbons), and Asp-361. Electron density for G418 was observed at the boundary between the two domains within each ODC monomer. A ten-amino acid loop region (392-401) near the 2-fold axis of the dimer interface, which contributes several residues that form the active site, is disordered in this structure. The disordering of residues in the active site provides a potential mechanism for inhibition by G418 and suggests that allosteric inhibition from this site is feasible.",

    "abstract": "Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is one of the major features of Parkinson's disease. Many redox-active metals such as iron and manganese have been implicated in neuronal degeneration characterized by symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease. Even though, arsenic, which is another redox-active metal, has been shown to affect the central monoaminergic systems, but its potential in causing dopaminergic cell degeneration has not been fully known. Hence, the present study was designed to investigate arsenic signaling especially that is mediated by reactive oxygen species and its effect on early transcription factors in dopamine producing mesencephalic cell line 1RB3AN27. These mesencephalic cells were treated with low concentrations of sodium arsenite (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 microM) and incubated for different periods of time (0-4 h). Arsenite was cytotoxic at 5 and 10 microM concentrations only after 72-h incubation period. Arsenite, in a dose-dependent manner, induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of early transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) as shown by electro mobility shift assay. Incubation of antioxidants, either N-acetyl-L-cysteine (50 microM) or alpha-tocopherol (50 microM) with 1 microM arsenite, suppressed ROS generation. Arsenite at 1 microM concentration was sufficient for maximal activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation. Time kinetics studies showed maximal activation of NF-kappaB by 1 microM concentration of arsenite was seen at 120 min and correlated with complete degradation of Ikappa Balpha at 60 min. Similarly, maximal activation of AP-1 by 1 microM concentration of arsenite occurred at 120 min. N-acetyl-L-cysteine at 50 microM concentration inhibited arsenite-induced NF-kappa B and AP-1. In addition, arsenite was shown to induce phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 at concentrations of 1 microM and above. These results suggest that arsenite, at low and subcytoxic concentrations, appears to induce oxidative stress leading to activation of early transcription factors whereas addition of antioxidant inhibited the activation of these factors.",

    "abstract": "Lubiprostone [RU 0211, SPI 0211] is a bicyclic fatty acid that acts as a chloride channel opener, increasing intestinal water secretion. Lubiprostone, an orally-administered formulation, is one of a series of functional fatty acid compounds discovered by Dr Ryuji Ueno, and is currently undergoing development for the treatment of constipation, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) and postoperative ileus with Sucampo Pharmaceutical's. Lubiprostone activates a specific chloride channel (CLC2) on cells lining the gut, thereby naturally increasing intestinal fluid secretion. The increased fluid level softens the stool, promotes spontaneous bowel movements, and reduces abdominal discomfort/pain and bloating. The chloride channel is a protein that controls cell membrane transport of chloride ion. Lubiprostone acts on the ClC-2 chloride channel, which is located in the apical intestinal membrane. In November 2004, Takeda Pharmaceuticals entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement for Lubiprostone with Sucampo Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of chronic constipation and constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (c-IBS). Under the terms of the agreement, Takeda received the right to market the product in the US and Canada, while Sucampo reserved the co-promotion rights for these countries. Takeda's wholly-owned US subsidiary, Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America Inc., will sell lubiprostone once the product is approved by the US FDA. Takeda will also receive an option for marketing rights in other territories, including Japan and Europe. Takeda and Sucampo agreed on the exclusive manufacturing and supply of Lubiprostone by R-Tech Ueno, Ltd, a member of the Sucampo Group. Sucampo has the potential to receive up to dollar US 210 million in initial and milestone payments, some of which are contingent upon the successful achievement of several milestones. Takeda will fund a major part of development costs not only for chronic constipation and c-IBS, but also for other indications in the gastroenterology field. Takeda will make royalty payments to Sucampo after the product is launched. In May 2005, Sucampo received dollar US 20 million from Takeda Pharmaceutical as payment for achieving a development milestone of initiating a phase III clinical trial of lubiprostone to treat patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Sucampo Pharmaceuticals submitted a new drug application (NDA) for lubiprostone to the FDA on 31 March 2005 for approval in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and associated symptoms in adults. Sucampo completed three long-term, open-label safety studies, which will support the NDA for lubiprostone, in treating constipation. Results from its second open-label safety study with lubiprostone were announced in February 2004, with the first two studies demonstrating long-term safety and sustained effectiveness in constipated subjects. In the US, the final phase III study for chronic constipation was completed in the fourth quarter of 2004. In November 2004, Sucampo announced completing a phase II safety and efficacy study of lubiprostone for the treatment of IBS-C. This study, which was initiated in April 2003, randomised 195 patients with documented IBS into four treatment groups (three doses of SPI 0211 and placebo) from 19 locations throughout the US.",

    "abstract": "We studied the effects of the novel neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 receptor antagonist H 409/22, and its inactive enantiomer H 510/45, on vascular responses evoked by endogenous and exogenous NPY in the pig in vivo. H 409/22 and H 510/45 were given as 30-min infusions, and the antagonistic effects and circulating plasma concentrations were measured. The initial and terminal half-lives of H 409/22 in plasma were approximately 3 and 30 min, respectively. In pigs pretreated with reserpine and transection of sympathetic nerves (depletion of noradrenaline), sympathetic nerve stimulation evoked nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor responses in kidney and hindlimb, mediated by neuronally released NPY. Significant inhibition of these vasoconstrictor responses, as well as of vascular responses to injections of exogenous NPY, were seen during a low-dose infusion of H 409/22 (1.8 nmol/kg/min), when plasma levels of the antagonist reached 77 +/- 8 nM. Greatest inhibitory effects were seen at the highest dose of H 409/22 (180 nmol/kg/min, giving plasma levels of 7.4 +/- 0.6 microM) when all vascular responses evoked by NPY were strongly attenuated or largely abolished. H 510/45 did not affect any of the vascular responses studied. It is concluded that H 409/22 potently and dose-dependently antagonizes vascular responses to exogenous and endogenous NPY in the pig, and thus represents an interesting tool for studies on NPY Y1 receptor-mediated effects in vivo.",

    "title": "AT1 antagonism by eprosartan lowers heart rate variability and baroreflex gain.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by ACE inhibitors has been demonstrated to reduce total mortality in cardiovascular diseases. This advantage was attributed in part to changes of autonomic cardiovascular control, exemplified by an increase of heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex gain (BRG). We sought to assess the effects of the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker eprosartan on HRV and BRG. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double-blind randomized cross-over design 25 young males took eprosartan (600 mg/day) and placebo each for a period of 7 days with a wash-out period of at least 4 weeks in between. At the end of the intake phases simultaneous recordings of arterial blood pressure (AP; Finapres) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were taken. Power spectra of HRV and arterial blood pressure variability (APV) were calculated by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and served to calculate BRG. Ang-II levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Eprosartan tended to lower mean AP, it slightly increased heart rate (HR) (p&lt;0.05), and markedly increased circulating Ang-II levels (p&lt;0.01). Eprosartan diminished the total power of HRV (p&lt;0.05) and the BRG (p&lt;0.01). The low/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio of HRV and the APV were not altered. CONCLUSIONS: AT1 antagonism by eprosartan lowers heart rate variability and baroreflex gain. We speculate that these findings are due to the marked increase in circulating angiotensin II (Ang II). Further studies are needed to clarify whether angiotensin type 1 (AT1) blockers with potential actions inside the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may have different effects on HRV and BRG.",

In the 1950s, when the physiologic role of fibrinolysis had not been established, they began to seek for compounds that inhibit the action of plasmin. They examined approximately 200 lysine derivatives and discovered epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid (t-AMCHA). In the 1970s, we selected thrombin as the target enzyme to be controlled; structure-activity relationship studies, taking arginine as the skeleton structure, led to the discovery of the selective thrombin inhibitor No. 205 (4-ethyl-1-[N2-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl)-L-arginyl]- 1-piperidine), and further attempts to minimize the toxicity finally led to No. 805 (argatroban, MD-805, (2R,4R)-4-methyl-1-(N2-[(3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinyl)-sulfo nyl]-L-arginyl)-2-piperidine carboxylic acid). Argatroban, without any cofactor, inhibits thrombin competitively. The high selectivity of the action of argatroban is promising for treating thrombosis in clinical practice. More recently, taking advantage of our knowledge obtained through previous studies, active center-directed plasmin inhibitors and a selective inhibitor of kallikrein have been found.",

    "title": "Phase I study of OM-174, a lipid A analogue, with assessment of immunological response, in patients with refractory solid tumors.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lipids A, the lipophilic partial structure of lipopolysaccharides, induce regression of several tumor types in animal models. Rather than exerting direct cytotoxic effect, these compounds trigger the immune system which in turn stimulates secretion of cytokines, and activates the inducible nitric oxide synthase, as well as immune cell infiltration of tumors. OM-174 is an analogue of lipid A with dual action on Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. In an experimental model of peritoneal carcinomatosis induced in BDIX rats by intraperitoneal injection of syngeneic PROb colon cancer cells, it induced a complete regression of tumors. The present phase I trial was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose, the recommended phase II dose and biological response associated with OM-174 administered as intravenous infusion. METHODS: Patients received OM-174 twice weekly for a total of 5, 10 or 15 injections of either 600, 800 or 1000 mug/m(2). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis and cytokine dosages were collected. NK cells activity and Toll-like receptors 4 polymorphism analysis were also performed. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included. The highest dose administered was 1000 mug/m(2) repeated in 15 injections. The most common toxicities were a chills, fever, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue and headache. No patient experienced haematological side effects. As no dose limiting toxicity was observed, despite a grade 3 respiratory complication, the maximal tolerated dose and recommended dose were not established. Three patients exhibited disease stabilization with a mean duration of 4 months. Pharmacokinetic profile of OM-174 was characterized by a low distribution volume and clearance. Analysis of TLR 4 polymorphysm showed that most (16/17) patients carried the wild type alleles. A progressive increase in NK cell number and activity was observed only in patients receiving 1000 mug/m(2) of OM-174. A peak of IL-8 and IL-10 concentrations were observed after each OM-174 injection. Peaks of TNF-alpha and IL-6 concentrations were detected after the first infusion and decreased progressively suggesting tolerance. CONCLUSION: OM-174 therapy was well tolerated at biologically active concentrations. Whereas the recommended dose was not determined, further studies are planned in combination with chemotherapy as animal models suggest a strong synergistic antitumor effect.

    "abstract": "Stem cell therapy for the prevention and treatment of cardiac dysfunction holds significant promise for patients with ischemic heart disease. Excitingly early clinical studies have demonstrated safety and some clinical feasibility, while at the same time studies in the laboratory have investigated mechanisms of action and strategies to optimize the effects of regenerative cardiac therapies. One of the key pathways that has been demonstrated critical in stem cell-based cardiac repair is (stromal cell-derived factor-1) SDF-1:CXCR4. SDF-1:CXCR4 has been shown to affect stem cell homing, cardiac myocyte survival and ventricular remodeling in animal studies of acute myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure. Recently released clinical data suggest that SDF-1 alone is sufficient to induce cardiac repair. Most importantly, studies like those on the SDF-1:CXCR4 axis have suggested mechanisms critical for cardiac regenerative therapies that if clinical investigators continue to ignore will result in poorly designed studies that will continue to yield negative results.",

    "abstract": "Regulator of G-protein signaling 9-2 (RGS9-2), a member of the RGS family of G GTPase accelerating proteins, is expressed specifically in the striatum, which participates in antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia and in levodopa-induced dyskinesia. We report that RGS9 knock-out mice develop abnormal involuntary movements when inhibition of dopaminergic transmission is followed by activation of D2-like dopamine receptors (DRs). These abnormal movements resemble drug-induced dyskinesia more closely than other rodent models. Recordings from striatal neurons of these mice establish that activation of D2-like DRs abnormally inhibits glutamate-elicited currents. We show that RGS9-2, via its DEP domain (for Disheveled, EGL-10, Pleckstrin homology), colocalizes with D2DRs when coexpressed in mammalian cells. Recordings from oocytes coexpressing D2DR or the m2 muscarinic receptor and G-protein-gated inward rectifier potassium channels show that RGS9-2, via its DEP domain, preferentially accelerates the termination of D2DR signals. Thus, alterations in RGS9-2 may be a key factor in the pathway leading from D2DRs to the side effects associated with the treatment both of psychoses and Parkinson's disease.",

    "title": "Quantitative structure-activity relationship studies of threo-methylphenidate analogs.",
    "abstract": "Complementary two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) techniques were used to derive a preliminary model for the dopamine transporter (DAT) binding affinity of 80 racemic threo-methylphenidate (MP) analogs. A novel approach based on using the atom-level E-state indices of the 14 common scaffold atoms in a sphere exclusion protocol was used to identify a test set for 2D- and 3D-QSAR model validation. Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) contour maps based on the structure-activity data of the training set indicate that the 2' position of the phenyl ring cannot tolerate much steric bulk and that addition of electron-withdrawing groups to the 3' or 4' positions of the phenyl ring leads to improved DAT binding affinity. In particular, the optimal substituents were found to be those whose bulk is mainly in the plane of the phenyl ring. Substituents with significant bulk above or below the plane of the ring led to decreased binding affinity. Suggested alterations to be explored in the design of new compounds are the placement at the 3' and 4' position of the phenyl ring of electron-withdrawing groups that lie chiefly in the plane of the ring, for example, halogen substituents on the 3',4'-benzo analog, 79. A complementary 2D-QSAR approach-partial least squares analysis using a reduced set of Molconn-Z descriptors-supports the CoMFA structure-activity interpretation that phenyl ring substitution is a major determinant of DAT binding affinity. The potential usefulness of the CoMFA models was demonstrated by the prediction of the binding affinity of methyl 2-(naphthalen-1-yl)-2-(piperidin-2-yl)acetate, an analog not in the original data set, to be in good agreement with the experimental value.",

    "abstract": "The characteristics of ATP-dependent transport of acetylcholine (ACh) in homogenates of pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells stably transfected with the human vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) cDNA are described. The human VAChT protein was abundantly expressed in this line and appeared as a diffuse band with a molecular mass of approximately 75 kDa on Western blots. Vesicular [3H]ACh accumulation increased approximately 20 times over levels attained by the endogenous rat VAChT, expressed at low levels in control PC-12 cells. The transport of [3H]ACh by human VAChT was dependent upon the addition of exogenous ATP at 37 degrees C. Uptake was abolished by low temperature (4 degrees C), the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (2.5 microM) and bafilomycin A1 (1 microM), a specific inhibitor of the vesicular H+-ATPase. The kinetics of [3H]ACh uptake by human VAChT were saturable, exhibiting an apparent Km of 0.97 +/- 0.1 mM and Vmax of 0.58 +/- 0.04 nmol/min/mg. Maximal steady-state levels of vesicular [3H]ACh accumulation were directly proportional to the concentration of substrate present in the medium with saturation occurring at approximately 4 mM. Uptake was stereospecifically inhibited by L-vesamicol with an IC50 of 14.7 +/- 1.5 nM. The apparent affinity (Kd) of [3H]vesamicol for human VAChT was 4.1 +/- 0.5 nM, and the Bmax was 8.9 +/- 0.6 pmol/mg. The turnover (Vmax/Bmax) of the human VAChT was approximately 65/min. This expression system should prove useful for the structure/function analysis of VAChT.",

The rat and mouse orthologs show 80% and 83% amino acid identity, respectively, to the human GPR105 protein. We demonstrate by genomic Southern blot analysis that there are no genes in the mouse or rat genomes with higher sequence similarity. Chromosomal mapping shows that the mouse and human genes are located on syntenic regions of chromosome 3. Further analyses of the rat and mouse GPR105 proteins show that they are activated by the same agonists as the human receptor, responding to UDP-glucose and closely related molecules with similar affinities. The mouse and rat receptors are widely expressed, as is the human receptor. Thus we conclude that we have identified the rat and mouse orthologs of the human gene GPR105.",

    "abstract": "Methylation is an essential process in the body. Methyl groups in the form of S-adenosylmethionine are used for the synthesis of many essential compounds (e.g., creatine, phosphatidylcholine, and the methylation of DNA in gene expression). Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is an abundant enzyme in liver. It catalyzes the methylation of glycine by using S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to form N-methylglycine (sarcosine) with the concommitant production of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). It plays an important role in the economy of methyl groups in the body. The function of GNMT has been hypothesized to provide an alternative route for the conversion of excess AdoMet to AdoHcy in order to preserve the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio. GNMT is also inhibited by a specific form of folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate pentaglutamate. As such, GNMT participates in a regulatory scheme that links the de novo synthesis of methyl groups to the availability of dietary methionine. This hypothesis can now be tested in man. We report here for the first time two Italian sibs who are compound heterzygotes in the gene that encodes GNMT. Both have evidence of mild liver disease. Each bears the same two missense mutations, one in exon 1 (Leu49Pro) and the second in exon 4 (His176Asn). Restriction enzyme analysis of panels of diverse DNA samples indicates that these mutations are not attributable to a common polymorphism.",

Here we report the activity of ispinesib against the in vitro and in vivo panels of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP). PROCEDURES: Ispinesib was tested against the PPTP in vitro panel cell lines at concentrations from 0.1 nM to 1 microM and against the in vivo tumor panel xenografts by intraperitoneal administration (5 or 10 mg/kg) every 4 days for 3 doses repeated at day 21. RESULTS: Ispinesib was highly potent against the PPTP's in vitro cell lines with a median IC(50) of 4.1 nM. Ispinesib (10 mg/kg) induced unexplained toxicity in mice bearing osteosarcoma xenografts and exceeded the MTD in 12 of 40 non-osteosarcoma xenografts. Ispinesib induced significant tumor growth delay in 88% (23/26) of evaluable xenografts. Using a time to event measure of efficacy, ispinesib had intermediate and high levels of activity against 4 (21%) and 5 (26%) of the 19 evaluable solid tumor xenografts, respectively. Ispinesib induced maintained complete responses (CR) in a rhabdoid tumor, a Wilms tumor and a Ewing sarcoma xenograft. Ispinesib (5 mg/kg) produced 2 complete and 2 partial responses among 6 evaluable xenografts in the ALL panel. The in vivo pattern of activity was distinctive from that previously reported for vincristine. CONCLUSIONS: Ispinesib demonstrated broad in vivo antitumor activity, including maintained complete responses for several xenografts, although with high toxicity rates at the doses studied.",

    "title": "An overview of phenserine tartrate, a novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Existing cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitor therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD), while effective in improving cognitive, behavioral and functional impairments, do not alter disease progression. Novel drug design studies have focused on the classical ChE inhibitor, (-)-physostigmine, producing alterations in chemical composition and three-dimensional structure, which may offer an improved therapeutic index. The phenylcarbamate derivative, (-)-phenserine, is a selective, non-competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In vivo, (-)-phenserine produces rapid, potent, and long-lasting AChE inhibition. As a possible result of its preferential brain selectivity, (-)-phenserine is significantly less toxic than (-)-physostigmine. In studies using the Stone maze paradigm, (-)-phenserine has been shown to improve cognitive performance in both young learning-impaired and elderly rats. In addition to reducing inactivation of acetylcholine in the brain, (-)-phenserine appears to have a second mode of action. Reduced secretion of beta-amyloid (Abeta) has been observed in cell lines exposed to (-)-phenserine, occurring through translational regulation of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) mRNA via a non-cholinergic mechanism. These in vitro findings appear to translate in vivo into animal models and humans. In a small study of patients with AD, (-)-phenserine treatment tended to reduce beta-APP and Abeta levels in plasma samples. Clinical studies also reveal that (-)-phenserine (5-10 mg b.i.d.) had a favorable safety and pharmacological profile, produced significant improvements in cognitive function and was well tolerated in patients with AD treated for 12 weeks. Further randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III studies assessing the efficacy, safety/tolerability and potential disease-modifying effects of (-)-phenserine in patients with AD are currently ongoing.",

The ID50 for the enzyme, purified from pig antrum mucosa by ultracentrifugation and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, was 2.5 muM. 2 In six dogs with Heidenhanin pouches the maximum secretory response to histamine (40 mug/kg i.m.) was augmented by i.m. injection of amodiaquine. The augmentation depended on the dose of amodiaquine, the optimum effect (40% increase in volume of gastric juice, 80% in acid output) being achieved with 2 mg/kg. The maximum secretory response to betazole was also enhanced by amodiaquine. 3 It was suggested that amodiaquine may enhance the histamine and betazole stimulated gastric secretion by an inhibition of gastric histamine methyltransferase in vivo.",

Herein, we characterized efficacies at human (h)D(2SHORT(S)), hD(2LONG(L)), hD(3), and hD(4.4) receptors and at halpha(2A)-, halpha(2B)-, halpha(2C)-, and halpha(1A)-adrenoceptors (ARs). As determined by guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding, no ligand displayed \"full\" efficacy relative to dopamine (100%) at all \"D(2)-like\" sites. However, at hD(2S) receptors quinpirole, pramipexole, ropinirole, quinerolane, pergolide, and cabergoline were as efficacious as dopamine (E(max)100%); TL99, talipexole, and apomorphine were highly efficacious (79-92%); piribedil, lisuride, bromocriptine, and terguride showed intermediate efficacy (40-55%); and roxindole displayed low efficacy (11%). For all drugs, efficacies were lower at hD(2L) receptors, with terguride and roxindole acting as antagonists. At hD(3) receptors, efficacies ranged from 33% (roxindole) to 94% (TL99), whereas, for hD(4) receptors, highest efficacies (approximately 70%) were seen for quinerolane, quinpirole, and TL99, whereas piribedil and terguride behaved as antagonists and bromocriptine was inactive. Although efficacies at hD(2S) versus hD(2L) sites were highly correlated (r = 0.79), they correlated only modestly to hD(3)/hD(4) sites (r = 0.44-0.59). In [(35)S]GTPgammaS studies of halpha(2A)-ARs, TL99 (108%), pramipexole (52%), talipexole (51%), pergolide (31%), apomorphine (16%), and quinerolane (11%) were agonists and ropinirole and roxindole were inactive, whereas piribedil and other agents were antagonists. Similar findings were obtained at halpha(2B)- and halpha(2C)-ARs. Using [(3)H]phosphatidylinositol depletion, roxindole, bromocriptine, lisuride, and terguride displayed potent antagonist properties at halpha(1A)-ARs. In conclusion, antiparkinson agents display diverse agonist and antagonist properties at multiple subtypes of D(2)-like receptor and alpha(1)/alpha(2)-AR, actions, which likely contribute to their contrasting functional profiles.",

    "abstract": "Considerable efforts have been made since the 1950s to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of metformin, a potent antihyperglycaemic agent now recommended as the first-line oral therapy for T2D (Type 2 diabetes). The main effect of this drug from the biguanide family is to acutely decrease hepatic glucose production, mostly through a mild and transient inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. In addition, the resulting decrease in hepatic energy status activates AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), a cellular metabolic sensor, providing a generally accepted mechanism for the action of metformin on hepatic gluconeogenesis. The demonstration that respiratory chain complex I, but not AMPK, is the primary target of metformin was recently strengthened by showing that the metabolic effect of the drug is preserved in liver-specific AMPK-deficient mice. Beyond its effect on glucose metabolism, metformin has been reported to restore ovarian function in PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), reduce fatty liver, and to lower microvascular and macrovascular complications associated with T2D. Its use has also recently been suggested as an adjuvant treatment for cancer or gestational diabetes and for the prevention in pre-diabetic populations. These emerging new therapeutic areas for metformin will be reviewed together with recent findings from pharmacogenetic studies linking genetic variations to drug response, a promising new step towards personalized medicine in the treatment of T2D.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Capecitabine and irinotecan are commonly used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). We hypothesized that germline polymorphisms within genes related to drug target (thymidylate synthase) or metabolizing enzymes (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, UGT) would impact response and toxicity to the combination of capecitabine plus irinotecan (CPT-11). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sixty-seven patients with measurable CRC were treated with irinotecan i.v. (100 or 125 mg/m(2)) on days 1 and 8 and capecitabine orally (900 or 1,000 mg/m(2), twice daily) on days 2 through 15 of each 3-week cycle. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and genotyped using Pyrosequencing, GeneScan, and direct sequencing (Big Dye terminator) technologies. RESULTS: The overall objective response rate was 45% with 21 patients (31%) exhibiting grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and 3 patients (4.5%) demonstrating grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in the first two cycles. Low enzyme activity UGT1A7 genotypes, UGT1A7*2/*2 (six patients) and UGT1A7*3/*3 (seven patients), were significantly associated with antitumor response (p = 0.013) and lack of severe gastrointestinal toxicity (p = 0.003). In addition, the UGT1A9 -118 (dT)(9/9) genotype was significantly associated with reduced toxicity (p = 0.002) and increased response (p = 0.047). There were no statistically significant associations between UGT1A1, UGT1A6, or thymidylate synthase genotypes and toxicity or tumor response. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest that UGT1A7 and/or UGT1A9 genotypes may be predictors of response and toxicity in CRC patients treated with capecitabine plus irinotecan. Specifically, patients with genotypes conferring low UGT1A7 activity and/or the UGT1A9 (dT)(9/9) genotype may be particularly likely to exhibit greater antitumor response with little toxicity.",

    "title": "Identification of the zinc-dependent endothelial cell binding protein for high molecular weight kininogen and factor XII: identity with the receptor that binds to the globular \"heads\" of C1q (gC1q-R).",
    "abstract": "High molecular weight kininogen (HK) and factor XII are known to bind to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a zinc-dependent and saturable manner indicating that HUVEC express specific binding site(s) for those proteins. However, identification and immunochemical characterization of the putative receptor site(s) has not been previously accomplished. In this report, we have identified a cell surface glycoprotein that is a likely candidate for the HK binding site on HUVECs. When solubilized HUVEC membranes were subjected to an HK-affinity column in the presence or absence of 50 microM ZnCl2 and the bound membrane proteins eluted, a single major protein peak was obtained only in the presence of zinc. SDS/PAGE analysis and silver staining of the protein peak revealed this protein to be 33 kDa and partial sequence analysis matched the NH2 terminus of gC1q-R, a membrane glycoprotein that binds to the globular \"heads\" of C1q. Two other minor proteins of approximately 70 kDa and 45 kDa were also obtained. Upon analysis by Western blotting, the 33-kDa band was found to react with several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing different epitopes on gC1q-R. Ligand and dot blot analyses revealed zinc-dependent binding of biotinylated HK as well as biotinylated factor XII to the isolated 33-kDa HUVEC molecule as well as recombinant gC1q-R. In addition, binding of 125I-HK to HUVEC cells was inhibited by selected monoclonal anti-gC1q-R antibodies. C1q, however, did not inhibit 125I-HK binding to HUVEC nor did those monoclonals known to inhibit C1q binding to gC1q-R. Taken together, the data suggest that HK (and factor XII) bind to HUVECs via a 33-kDa cell surface glycoprotein that appears to be identical to gC1q-R but interact with a site on gC1q-R distinct from that which binds C1q.",

    "abstract": "Pyridoxal-5-phosphate, the biological active form of pyridoxine, is a cofactor for dopa-decarboxylase (DDC) enzyme. Pyridoxine may augment the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery and therefore decrease availability of levodopa to the brain. However, this effect can be negated in the presence of a DDC inhibitor, which potentiates plasma levodopa level. A single nucleotide polymorphism at the nucleotide 1947 in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene encodes the high (COMT(H)) and low activity (COMT(L)) forms of the enzyme. In this study, we examined the effect of the COMT(L) allele on the clinical response to pyridoxine in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. PD patients who were on stable and optimized dose of levodopa were included in this study. Their mean motor and activities of living score improved after high dose pyridoxine (P = 0.09, P = 0.04), and worsened after a washout period (P = 0.005, P = 0.001). Using a multivariate model, the presence of the COMT(L) allele predicted response to pyridoxine, with the best outcome observed in COMT(L/L) homozygotes. Our observational study suggests that the status the functional COMT(L) variant may be potentially useful to select PD patients for high dose pyridoxine therapy.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin spindle protein (KSP), a microtubule-associated motor protein essential for cell cycle progression, is overexpressed in many cancers and is a potential anti-tumor target. We found that inhibition of KSP by a selective inhibitor, ARRY-520, blocked cell cycle progression, leading to apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines that express high levels of KSP. Knockdown of p53, overexpression of XIAP and mutation in caspase-8 did not significantly affect sensitivity to ARRY-520, suggesting that the response is independent of p53, XIAP and the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Although ARRY-520 induced mitotic arrest in both HL-60 and Bcl-2-overexpressing HL-60Bcl-2 cells, cell death was blunted in HL-60Bcl-2 cells, suggesting that the apoptotic program is executed through the mitochondrial pathway. Accordingly, inhibition of Bcl-2 by ABT-737 was synergistic with ARRY-520 in HL-60Bcl-2 cells. Furthermore, ARRY-520 increased Bim protein levels prior to caspase activation in HL-60 cells. ARRY-520 significantly inhibited tumor growth of xenografts in SCID mice and inhibited AML blast but not normal colony formation, supporting a critical role for KSP in proliferation of leukemic progenitor cells. These results demonstrate that ARRY-520 potently induces cell cycle block and subsequent death in leukemic cells via the mitochondrial pathway and has the potential to eradicate AML progenitor cells.",

The effect of SB-271046 was compared to clozapine in all models tested. This study showed that SB-271046 had no beneficial effect in PCP-disrupted SIT. However, SB-271046 dose-dependently normalised D-amphetamine-disrupted PPI, but did not reverse PCP-disrupted PPI. In addition, SB-271046 did not antagonise D-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. Thus, this specific 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist was associated with a clear positive outcome in only one model for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and had no beneficial effect in the model for negative symptoms.

We explore here a new series of variously substituted coumarins and a thiocoumarin for their interaction with 13 mammalian CA isoforms, detecting low nanomolar and isoform selective inhibitors. The mechanism of action of this class of inhibitors is delineated in detail by resolving the X-ray crystal structure of CA II in complex with trans-2-hydroxy-cinnamic acid, the in situ hydrolysis product of simple coumarin. Thiocoumarins also act as efficient CAIs, similarly to coumarins. The versatility of the (thio)coumarin chemistry, the cis-trans isomerization evidenced here, and easy derivatization of the (thio)coumarin rings, coupled with the nanomolar inhibition range of several isozymes, afford isoform-selective CAIs with various biomedical applications, which render these classes of compounds superior to the clinically used sulfonamides.",

    "abstract": "The microO-conotoxins are an intriguing class of conotoxins targeting various voltage-dependent sodium channels and molluscan calcium channels. In the current study, we have shown MrVIA and MrVIB to be the first known peptidic inhibitors of the transient tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Na(+) current in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, in addition to inhibiting tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na(+) currents. Human TTX-R sodium channels are a therapeutic target for indications such as pain, highlighting the importance of the microO-conotoxins as potential leads for drug development. Furthermore, we have used NMR spectroscopy to provide the first structural information on this class of conotoxins. MrVIA and MrVIB are hydrophobic peptides that aggregate in aqueous solution but were solubilized in 50% acetonitrile/water. The three-dimensional structure of MrVIB consists of a small beta-sheet and a cystine knot arrangement of the three-disulfide bonds. It contains four backbone \"loops\" between successive cysteine residues that are exposed to the solvent to varying degrees. The largest of these, loop 2, is the most disordered part of the molecule, most likely due to flexibility in solution. This disorder is the most striking difference between the structures of MrVIB and the known delta- and omega-conotoxins, which along with the microO-conotoxins are members of the O superfamily. Loop 2 of omega-conotoxins has previously been shown to contain residues critical for binding to voltage-gated calcium channels, and it is interesting to speculate that the flexibility observed in MrVIB may accommodate binding to both sodium and molluscan calcium channels.",

    "title": "X-ray structure of the V301L aldo-keto reductase 1B10 complexed with NADP(+) and the potent aldose reductase inhibitor fidarestat: implications for inhibitor binding and selectivity.",
    "abstract": "Only one crystal structure is currently available for tumor marker AKR1B10, complexed with NADP(+) and tolrestat, which is an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) of the carboxylic acid type. Here, the X-ray structure of the complex of the V301L substituted AKR1B10 holoenzyme with fidarestat, an ARI of the cyclic imide type, was obtained at 1.60A resolution by replacement soaking of crystals containing tolrestat. Previously, fidarestat was found to be safe in phase III trials for diabetic neuropathy and, consistent with its low in vivo side effects, was highly selective for aldose reductase (AR or AKR1B1) versus aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). Now, inhibition studies showed that fidarestat was indeed 1300-fold more selective for AR as compared to AKR1B10, while the change of Val to Leu (found in AR) caused a 20-fold decrease in the IC50 value with fidarestat. Structural analysis of the V301L AKR1B10-fidarestat complex displayed enzyme-inhibitor interactions similar to those of the AR-fidarestat complex. However, a close inspection of both the new crystal structure and a computer model of the wild-type AKR1B10 complex with fidarestat revealed subtle changes that could affect fidarestat binding. In the crystal structure, a significant motion of loop A was observed between AR and V301L AKR1B10, linked to a Phe-122/Phe-123 side chain displacement. This was due to the presence of the more voluminous Gln-303 side chain (Ser-302 in AR) and of a water molecule buried in a subpocket located at the base of flexible loop A. In the wild-type AKR1B10 model, a short contact was predicted between the Val-301 side chain and fidarestat, but would not be present in AR or in V301L AKR1B10. Overall, these changes could contribute to the difference in inhibitory potency of fidarestat between AR and AKR1B10.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: N-3 fatty acids may decrease risk of colorectal cancer by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme and production of proinflammatory eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid (20:4n-6). Aspirin also inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme and may share with n-3 fatty acids a potential mechanism to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control analysis using blood samples collected from the Physicians' Health Study participants in 1982 to 1984. N-3 and n-6 fatty acid levels were measured using gas-liquid chromatography for 178 men who developed colorectal cancer through December 31, 1995 and 282 age- and smoking-matched controls. We used conditional logistic regression to examine associations. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Total long-chain n-3 fatty acids were nonsignificantly inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk [relative risk (RR) for highest versus lowest quartile, 0.60; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.32 to 1.11; P(trend) = 0.10], after adjustment for possible confounders. We observed potential interaction between randomized aspirin assignment and long-chain n-3 fatty acid levels (P(interaction) = 0.04). Among men not on aspirin, RRs (95% CI) for increasing quartiles of long-chain n-3 fatty acids were 1.00 (reference), 0.60 (0.28-1.28), 0.51 (0.22-1.17), and 0.34 (0.15-0.82), P(trend) = 0.006. For participants taking aspirin, there was no additional benefit of increasing n-3 fatty acid levels. The RR (95% CI) for the highest versus lowest quartile of n-6 fatty acids was 0.64 (0.35-1.17). CONCLUSIONS: Blood levels of long-chain n-3 fatty acids were associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer among men not using aspirin. N-6 fatty acids were nonsignificantly inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk.",

As expected, tracheal smooth muscle sensitivity to electrical field stimulation was increased in tissues pretreated with the muscarinic M2-receptor antagonist, gallamine.

Unlike gallamine, the synthetic cationic polypeptides, poly-L-arginine, poly-L-lysine, poly-D-lysine, the cationic dye ruthenium red and the anionic polysaccharide, heparin, failed to increase significantly tracheal smooth muscle sensitivity to electrical field stimulation. 3. Poly-L-arginine, ruthenium red and heparin had no effect on the contractile response to exogenously applied methacholine. 4.

Disopyramide caused a parallel shift of the dose-response curves for acetylcholine, McN-A-343, and carbachol to the right in the guinea pig taenia caeci; pA2 values were 5.4 for acetylcholine, 5.5 for McN-A-343 and 5.9 for carbachol. In the guinea pig ileum, disopyramide competitively antagonized acetylcholine in the contractile responses, having the pA2 value of 6.1. In microsomal fractions of the guinea pig taenia caecum and heart, disopyramide was capable of replacing 3H-QNB; K1 values were 7 x 10(-6) M for the taenia and 2 x 10(-6) M for the heart.

    "abstract": "Tryptase is the major secretory protease of human mast cells and is proposed to be involved in neuropeptide processing and tissue inflammation. Exploration of the biology of tryptase has been hindered by the lack of potent, selective inhibitors. The current study explores the properties of aromatic diamidines as inhibitors of dog and human tryptase. The strongest inhibitors of tryptase in this series are bis(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)methane (BABIM) and (5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)-(5-(N,N'-dimethylamidino)-2- benzimidazolyl)methane, which exhibit K(i) values of 1.8 and 1.4 nM, respectively, in blocking the hydrolysis of tosyl-L-Gly-Pro-Lys-4-nitroanilide by human tryptase. These compounds are approximately 10,000-fold more potent than benzamidine, and are the strongest reversible inhibitors of tryptase described to date. Other aromatic mono- and diamidines, including amiloride and pentamidine, are less potent. Nonetheless, they abolish tryptase activity at high inhibitor concentrations. The rank order of tryptase inhibitor potency parallels that of inhibitors tested against trypsin. BABIM, the only highly active member of this series whose potency against other targets has been examined previously, is a far stronger inhibitor of tryptase than of other trypsin-like serine proteases, including those involved with hemostasis, fibrinolysis and the complement system. Therefore, BABIM appears to have selective affinity for tryptase. In addition to inhibiting tryptase-induced hydrolysis of peptide-based chromogenic substrates, BABIM blocks completely the reversal of vasoactive intestinal peptide-induced relaxation of isolated trachea by dog tryptase. Thus, BABIM and related amidines are potent inhibitors of mast cell tryptases that may be useful in exploring mast cell protease biology.",

The ability of these indolequinones to function as mechanism-based inhibitors of purified recombinant human NQO1 was evaluated, as was their ability to inhibit both NQO1 and cell growth in human pancreatic MIA PaCa-2 tumor cells. The inhibition of rhNQO1 was related to the pKa of the leaving group: compounds with poorer phenolic leaving groups were poor inhibitors whereas those with more acidic leaving groups were more efficient inhibitors. These inhibition data also correlated with the inhibition NQO1 in MIA PaCa-2 cells. However, the data demonstrate that NQO1 inhibition does not correlate with growth inhibitory activity, at least in the MIA PaCa-2 cell line, suggesting that targets in addition to NQO1 need to be considered to explain the potent growth inhibitory activity of this series of indolequinones in human pancreatic cancer cells.",

By stimulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, DCA facilitates oxidation of lactate and decreases morbidity in acquired and congenital forms of lactic acidosis. The drug improves cardiac output and left ventricular mechanical efficiency under conditions of myocardial ischemia or failure, probably by facilitating myocardial metabolism of carbohydrate and lactate as opposed to fat. DCA may also enhance regional lactate removal and restoration of brain function in experimental states of cerebral ischemia. DCA appears to inhibit its own metabolism, which may influence the duration of its pharmacologic actions and lead to toxicity. DCA can cause a reversible peripheral neuropathy that may be related to thiamine deficiency and may be ameliorated or prevented with thiamine supplementation. Other toxic effects of DCA may be species-specific and reflect marked interspecies variation in pharmacokinetics.

    "abstract": "Among the five human 5-HT(4) (h5-HT(4)) receptor isoforms, the h5-HT(4(a)) receptor was studied with a particular emphasis on the molecular interactions involved in ligand binding. For this purpose, we used site-directed mutagenesis of the transmembrane domain. Twelve mutants were constructed with a special focus on the residue P4.53 of helix IV which substitutes in h5-HT(4) receptors the highly conserved S residue among the rhodopsin family receptors. The mutated receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Ligand binding or competition studies with two h5-HT(4) receptor agonists, serotonin and ML10302 and two h5-HT(4) receptor antagonists, [(3)H]-GR113808 and ML10375 were performed on wild type and mutant receptors. Functional activity of the receptors was evaluated by measuring the ability of serotonin to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. Ligand binding experiments revealed that [(3)H]-GR113808 did not bind to mutants P4.53A, S5.43A, F6.51A, Y7.43A and to double mutant F6.52V/N6.55L. On the other hand mutations D3.32N, S5.43A and Y7.43A appeared to promote a dramatic decrease of h5-HT(4(a)) receptor functional activity. From these studies, S5.43 and Y7.43 clearly emerged as common anchoring sites to antagonist [(3)H]-GR113808 and to serotonin. According to these results, we propose ligand-receptor complex models with serotonin and [(3)H]-GR113808. For serotonin, three interaction points were selected including ionic interaction with D3.32, a stabilizing interaction of this ion pair by Y7.43 and a hydrogen bond with S5.43. [(3)H]-GR113808 was also docked, based on the same type of interactions with S5.43 and D3.32: the proposed model suggested a possible role of P4.53 in helix IV structure allowing the involvement of a close hydrophobic residue, W4.50, in a hydrophobic pocket for hydrophobic interactions with the indole ring of [(3)H]-GR113808.",

    "abstract": "The cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8)-inactivating peptidase is a serine peptidase that has been shown to be a membrane-bound isoform of tripeptidyl peptidase II (EC 3.4.14.10). It cleaves the neurotransmitter CCK-8 sulfate at the Met-Gly bond to give Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Met-OH + Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2. Starting from Val-Pro-NHBu, a dipeptide of submicromolar affinity that had previously been generated to serve as a lead, successive optimization at P3, P1, and then P2 gave Abu-Pro-NHBu (18, Ki = 80 nM). Further transformation (by making a benzologue) gave the indoline analogue, butabindide (33) as a reversible inhibitor having nanomolar affinity (Ki = 7 nM). Retrospective analysis suggested the possibility of a general approach to designing exopeptidase inhibitors starting from the structure of the first hydrolysis product. Application of this approach to CCK-8 led to Abu-Phe-NHBu (37), but this only had Ki = 9.4 microM. Molecular modeling, to determine the minimum energy conformations and explain the 1000-fold better affinity of butabindide, indicated that 37 cannot access the likely active conformation of butabindide.",

In the peripheral nociceptive system, a Na(+) channel subtype resistant to TTX and with distinct electrophysiological properties seems to be of importance for impulse generation and conduction. A current through TTX-resistant Na(+) channels displays slower activation and inactivation kinetics and has an increased activation threshold compared with TTX-sensitive Na(+) currents and may have different pharmacological properties. We studied the effects of stereoisomers of piperidine local anesthetics on neuronal TTX-resistant Na(+) currents recorded with the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp method in enzymatically dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons of adult rats. Stereoisomers of mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and bupivacaine reversibly inhibited TTX-resistant Na(+) currents in a concentration and use-dependent manner. All drugs accelerated time course of inactivation. Half-maximal blocking concentrations were determined from concentration-inhibition relationships. Potencies for tonic and for use-dependent block increased with rising lipid solubilities of the drugs. Stereoselective action was not observed. We conclude that block of TTX-resistant Na(+) currents may lead to blockade of TTX-resistant action potentials in nociceptive fibers and consequently may be responsible for pain suppression during local anesthesia.",

    "title": "Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate and cyclic ADP-ribose regulate TRPM2 channels in T lymphocytes.",
    "abstract": "TRPM2 (previously designated TRPC7 or LTRPC2) is a Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel that contains a C-terminal enzymatic domain with pyrophosphatase activity, which specifically binds ADP-ribose. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can facilitate ADPR-mediated activation of heterologously expressed TRPM2. Here, we show that the two Ca2+-mobilizing second messengers cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) strongly activate natively expressed TRPM2 channels in Jurkat T cells. TRPM2 activation by both agonists can be partially suppressed by the ADPR antagonist adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which suggests that cADPR and NAADP lead to mobilization of endogenous ADPR presumably via metabolic conversion. The remaining channel activity is due to direct gating of TRPM2 by the two agonists and can be completely suppressed by 8-Br-cADPR, which suggests that cADPR and NAADP share a common binding site on TRPM2 that can regulate TRPM2 activity in synergy with ADPR. We conclude that cADPR and NAADP, in combination with ADPR, represent physiological co-activators of TRPM2 that contribute to Ca2+ influx in T lymphocytes and presumably other cell types that express this channel.",

The tetramethylrhodamyl (Rhm) group was attached to the precursor peptide of 9 to give [HO(1)][Orn(8)(5/6C-Rhm)]VT (11). All 11 fluorescent peptides were evaluated in human OT and vasopressin V(1a) (vasoconstrictor), V(1b) (pituitary), and V(2) (antidiuretic) receptor binding and functional assays. With K(d) = 6.24, 217, &gt;10000, and &gt;10000 nM for the OT, V(1a), V(1b), and V(2) receptors, peptide 1 is a potent and selective fluorescent OT antagonist and may be useful for specifically labeling OT receptors while peptide 2 exhibits low affinities for all the receptors. The fluorescent peptides 3-10 are all very potent agonists for the human OT receptor. They exhibit the following K(d) values (nM) for the human OT, V(1a), V(1b), and V(2) receptors, respectively: (3) 0.29, 57, 124, &gt;10000; (4) 1.8, 25.5, 150, &gt;10000; (5) 0.34, 13.7, 66, nd (not determined); (6) 0.32, 17.3, 53, &gt;10000; (7) 0.25, 107, 393, &gt;10000; (8) 0.40, 30, 282, &gt;10000; (9) 0.18, 12.2, 126, nd; (10) 0.17, 11.8, 87, &gt;1000; (11) 0.092, 7.36, nd, nd. Peptide 7 exhibits both a high affinity and a high selectivity for human OT receptors. Peptides 7 and 11 were utilized to study the internalization of the OT receptor-ligand complex. Preliminary studies indicate that this process is similar to that observed for the vasopressin V(1a) receptor and differs from that observed for vasopressin V(2) receptors. Some or all of the fluorescent OT antagonists and agonists reported here are very promising new fluorescent ligands for labeling cells which express the human OT receptor and are also useful tools to follow endocytosis of the receptor-ligand complex.",

These two alleles were shown previously to be associated with ivermectin susceptibility (HG1A) and resistance (HG1E), respectively. Sequence analysis indicates that they differ in four amino acids. To explore the functional properties of the two alleles, a full-length cDNA encoding the beta subunit, a key functional component of the GABA receptor, was isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans (gab-1, corresponding to the GenBank locus ZC482.1) and coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes with the HG1 alleles. When gab-1 was coexpressed with either the HG1A allele or the HG1E allele in Xenopus oocytes, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-responsive channels with different sensitivity to the agonist were formed. The effects of ivermectin on the hetero-oligomeric receptors were determined. Application of ivermectin alone had no effect on the receptors. However, when coapplied with 10 micro m GABA, ivermectin potentiated the GABA-evoked current of the GAB-1/HG1A receptor, but attenuated the GABA response of the GAB-1/HG1E receptor. We demonstrated that the coexpressed HG1 and GAB-1 receptors are GABA-responsive, and provide evidence for the possible involvement of GABA receptors in the mechanism of ivermectin resistance.",

    "abstract": "The important and diverse biological functions of adrenergic receptors, a subclass of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), have made the search for compounds that selectively stimulate or inhibit the activity of different adrenergic receptor subtypes an important area of medicinal chemistry. We previously synthesized 2-, 5-, and 6-fluoronorepinehprine (FNE) and 2-, 5-, and 6-fluoroepinephrine (FEPI) and found that 2FNE and 2FEPI were selective beta-adrenergic agonists and that 6FNE and 6FEPI were selective alpha-adrenergic agonists, while 5FNE and 5FEPI were unselective. Agonist potencies correlated well with receptor binding affinities. Here, through a combination of molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified N293 in the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor as a crucial residue for the selectivity of the receptor for catecholamines fluorinated at different positions.",

    "title": "Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1): the misunderstood HDAC.",
    "abstract": "The sirtuin family of NAD-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) consists of seven mammalian proteins, SIRT1-7. Many of the sirtuin isoforms also deacetylate nonhistone substrates, such as p53 (SIRT1) and alpha-tubulin (SIRT2). The sirtuin literature focuses on pharmacological activators of SIRT1 (e.g., resveratrol, SRT1720), proposed as therapeutics for diabetes, neurodegeneration, inflammation, and others. However, many of the SIRT1 activator results may have been due to artifacts in the assay methodology (i.e., use of fluorescently tagged substrates). A biological role for SIRT1 in cancer has been given less scrutiny but is no less equivocal. Although proposed initially as an oncogene, we present herein compelling data suggesting that SIRT1 is indeed a context-specific tumor suppressor. For oncology, SIRT1 inhibitors (dual SIRT1/2) are indicated as potential therapeutics. A number of sirtuin inhibitors have been developed but with mixed results in cellular systems and animal models. It is unclear whether this has been due to poorly understood model systems, signalling redundancy, and/or inadequately potent and selective tool compounds. This review provides an overview of recent developments in the field of SIRT1 function. While focusing on oncology, it aims to shed light on new concepts of expanding the selectivity spectrum, including other sirtuins such as SIRT2.",

To characterize the properties of fluorinated repaglinide, the affinity of the analogous non-radioactive (19)F-compound for binding to the human SUR1 isoform was assessed. [(19)F]Repaglinide induced a complete monophasic inhibition curve with a Hill coefficient close to 1 (1.03) yielding a dissociation constant (K(D)) of 134 nM. Biological activity was proven via insulin secretion experiments on isolated rat islets and was comparable to that of repaglinide. Finally, biodistribution of [(18)F]repaglinide was investigated in rats by measuring the concentration of the compound in different organs after i.v. injection. Pancreatic tissue displayed a stable accumulation of approximately 0.12% of the injected dose from 10 min to 30 min p.i. 50% of the radioactive tracer could be displaced by additional injection of unlabeled repaglinide, indicating that [(18)F]repaglinide might be suitable for in vivo investigation with PET.",

    "abstract": "Luteolin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, is abundant in our daily dietary intake. It exhibits a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, but little is known about its biochemical targets other than the fact that it induces topoisomerase II-mediated apoptosis. In the present study, we show that luteolin completely inhibits the catalytic activity of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I at a concentration of 40 microM, with an IC50 of 5 microM. Preincubation of enzyme with luteolin before adding a DNA substrate increases the inhibition of the catalytic activity (IC50=0.66 microM). Treatment of DNA with luteolin before addition of topoisomerase I reduces this inhibitory effect. Subsequent fluorescence tests show that luteolin not only interacts directly with the enzyme but also with the substrate DNA, and intercalates at a very high concentration (&gt;250 microM) without binding to the minor groove. Direct interaction between luteolin and DNA does not affect the assembly of the enzyme-DNA complex, as evident from the electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. Here we show that the inhibition of topoisomerase I by luteolin is due to the stabilization of topoisomerase-I DNA-cleavable complexes. Hence, luteolin is similar to camptothecin, a class I inhibitor, with respect to its ability to form the topoisomerase I-mediated 'cleavable complex'. But, unlike camptothecin, luteolin interacts with both free enzyme and substrate DNA. The inhibitory effect of luteolin is translated into concanavalin A-stimulated mouse splenocytes, with the compound inducing SDS-K+-precipitable DNA-topoisomerase complexes. This is the first report on luteolin as an inhibitor of the catalytic activity of topoisomerase I, and our results further support its therapeutic potential as a lead anti-cancer compound that poisons topoisomerases.",

    "title": "A perlecan-inducing compound significantly inhibits smooth muscle cell function and in-stent intimal hyperplasia: novel insights into the diverse biological effects of perlecan.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Perlecan is the major heparan sulfate proteoglycan in the arterial wall. Previous studies have suggested that perlecan is a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle cell (SMC) activity. Therefore, perlecan overexpression may serve as a therapeutic modality to prevent in-stent restenosis (ISR). We have investigated a novel compound (RUS3108), identified in a SMC based screen to induce perlecan synthesis in SMC. The aims of this study were to assess the in vitro effects of RUS3108 and the effects of RUS3108-eluting stents in preventing ISR. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rabbit aortic SMC and bovine aortic endothelial cells (EC) were used in this study. Immunohistochemistry showed that RUS3108-treated SMC over-expressed perlecan indicating the drug effects. Furthermore, RUS3108 induced a SMC differentiated phenotype by SMembryonic staining. RUS3108 (1 microM) inhibited 3H-thymidine incorporation by &gt;50%, which was completely reversed by a perlecan antibody. RUS3108 also inhibited SMC migration (Boyden chamber) and MMP-9 activity. In contrast, RUS3108 (100nM) modestly stimulated EC 3H-thymidine incorporation by 22% (p&lt;0.02). In vivo, a total of 30 stents were deployed in rabbit iliac arteries as follows: 1) bare metal stents (n=10), 2) polymer onlycoated stents (n=10), and 3) polymer-coated stents containing RUS3108 (n=10). Rabbits were sacrificed at four weeks and stented segments were subjected to morphometric analysis. Intimal cross sectional area was significantly lower in the RUS3108-eluting stent group (0.31+ or -0.27 mm(2) versus 1.0 + or - 0.31 and 1.25 + or - 0.51 in the bare metal stents and polymer only coated stents groups, respectively, p&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: RUS3108 is a novel perlecan-inducing compound, which is a potent inhibitor of SMC activity and a modest stimulator of EC proliferation. RUS3108-eluting stents may serve as an excellent modality for the prevention of ISR.",

Cisapride is already used clinically to increase gastric contractions. The stimulatory effects of TKS159 and cisapride on gastric contractions were examined using force transducers chronically implanted on the vagally denervated pouch (Heidenhain pouch) and the vagally innervated main stomach in conscious dogs. Contractile activity was analysed by computer and expressed as a motor index. Intravenous administration of TKS159 or cisapride significantly increased the motor index in both the main stomach and the Heidenhain pouch during the fed and fasted states. Pharmacological characterization in the fasted state revealed that the contraction-stimulating activity of TKS159 and cisapride on the stomach was significantly inhibited by atropine, hexamethonium and a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, SDZ 205-557. Granisetron (a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) significantly inhibited cisapride-induced, but not TKS159-induced gastric contractions. The plasma motilin concentration was significantly increased after cisapride, but not after TKS159 injection. In conclusion, TKS159 has a contractile-stimulating effect on both the innervated and the denervated stomach. It is likely that a cholinergic pathway and 5-HT4 receptors are involved in producing the contractions, although other mechanisms cannot be excluded. Cisapride has almost the same characteristics, but the present findings suggest the involvement of motilin and 5-HT3 receptors in the effects of cisapride.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of retinal neurons is a major cause of vision impairment in blinding diseases that affect children and adults worldwide. Cellular damage resulting from polyamine catabolism has been demonstrated to be a major player in many neurodegenerative conditions. We have previously shown that inhibition of polyamine oxidase (PAO) using MDL 72527 significantly reduced retinal neurodegeneration and cell death signaling pathways in hyperoxia-mediated retinopathy. In the present study, we investigated the impact of PAO inhibition in limiting retinal neurodegeneration in a model of NMDA (N-Methyl-D-aspartate)-induced excitotoxicity. Adult mice (8-10 weeks old) were given intravitreal injections (20 nmoles) of NMDA or NMLA (N-Methyl-L-aspartate, control). Intraperitoneal injection of MDL 72527 (40 mg/kg body weight/day) or vehicle (normal saline) was given 24 h before NMDA or NMLA treatment and continued until the animals were sacrificed (varied from 1 to 7 days). Analyses of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer cell survival was performed on retinal flatmounts. Retinal cryostat sections were prepared for immunostaining, TUNEL assay and retinal thickness measurements. Fresh frozen retinal samples were used for Western blotting analysis. A marked decrease in the neuronal survival in the RGC layer was observed in NMDA treated retinas compared to their NMLA treated controls, as studied by NeuN immunostaining of retinal flatmounts. Treatment with MDL 72527 significantly improved survival of NeuN positive cells in the NMDA treated retinas. Excitotoxicity induced neurodegeneration was also demonstrated by reduced levels of synaptophysin and degeneration of inner retinal neurons in NMDA treated retinas compared to controls. TUNEL labeling studies showed increased cell death in the NMDA treated retinas. However, treatment with MDL 72527 markedly reduced these changes. Analysis of signaling pathways during excitotoxic injury revealed the downregulation of pro-survival signaling molecules p-ERK and p-Akt, and the upregulation of a pro-apoptotic molecule BID, which were normalized with PAO inhibition. Our data demonstrate that inhibition of polyamine oxidase blocks NMDA-induced retinal neurodegeneration and promotes cell survival, thus offering a new therapeutic target for retinal neurodegenerative disease conditions.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cabergoline is an ergotic dopamine agonist with D2 receptor activity and a very long half-life. This pharmacological profile may result in clinically different effects. Small clinical trials indicate that overnight switching from 1 agonist to another can be performed safely. OBJECTIVE: To determine safety and efficacy of overnight switching from dopamine agonists to cabergoline in patients with advanced Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: Patients with advanced PD and motor complications not optimally controlled by levodopa and a stable dose of bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, and ropinirole were converted to cabergoline overnight. Patients were assessed by using an on-off diary, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (subscales I-IV), Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life 8 (PDQ-8), an ad hoc sleep questionnaire and an ad hoc off-period severity questionnaire. All rating scales were administered just before conversion and after 2, 6, and 12 weeks of treatment, when patients were on an optimal dose of cabergoline. Adverse effects were assessed at every visit following a check list. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-eight patients were included in the trial. Forty were on pergolide (mean dose, 2.8 mg/d), 38 on pramipexole (mean dose, 2.1 mg/d), and 32 on ropinirole (mean dose, 8.1 mg/d). Patients on bromocriptine (n = 18) were excluded from the analysis because of the small sample size. Three patients reported serious side effects (respiratory arrest, dyskinesias, and face edema and abdominal pain). Twenty-eight patients reported 41 adverse events. Twelve patients were withdrawn due to adverse effects (hallucinations [n = 5], dyspnea [n = 1], dizziness [n = 4], and vascular problems [n = 2]). A significant improvement in assessed parameters was obtained (P < 0.0001). Mean levodopa dose remained unchanged. After 12 weeks, the mean dose of cabergoline was 3.2 mg, and 25% of patients were taking the drug twice a day. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from pergolide, ropinirole, and pramipexole to cabergoline in an overnight schedule is safe. The observed clinical improvement may be related to a placebo effect, to the use of low doses of dopamine agonists, or to a direct effect of cabergoline.",

Five-to-six-week-old, heterozygous mREN2 rats received the following drug regimens for 8 weeks: 1) vehicle, 2) cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor (MF-tricyclic [3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl) phenyl)-2(5H)-furanone], 14 mg/kg p.o.), 3) COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor (sulindac, 14 mg/kg p.o.), 4) angiotensin II receptor antagonist (losartan 40 mg/kg p.o.). Normotensive Sprague Dawley (SD) rats served as controls. In vitro vascular responses of the descending aorta and renal artery were studied using organ bath system. mREN2 rats developed pronounced hypertension which was associated with impaired endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vascular relaxations in the aorta. In contrast, the relaxation responses of the renal arteries remained largely unchanged in mREN2 rats. Urinary NO, excretion, a marker of total body NO generation, was also decreased in mREN2 rats. Neither non-selective COX inhibitor sulindac nor COX-2 selective MF-tricyclic were capable of preventing Ang II-induced hypertension or endothelial dysfunction in mREN2 rats, whereas ATi receptor antagonist losartan completely normalized blood pressure, vascular relaxation responses as well as urinary NOx excretion. Our findings indicate that NO synthesis and/or bioavailability as well as the sensitivity of arterial smooth muscle cells to NO are decreased in mREN2 rats. The present study also demonstrated that COX does not play a central role in the pathogenesis of Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction in mREN2 rats.",

Multiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension, including prostacyclin, endothelin-1, and nitric oxide pathways amongst others. The first agent to be approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension was synthetic prostacyclin (epoprostenol), followed by prostaglandin analogs (iloprost, treprostinil, and beraprost [Japan and Korea]), which act on prostaglandin receptors. This article reviews the physiology and pathophysiology of prostanoids, summarizes key clinical studies of prostaglandin analogs for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, and discusses important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic distinctions between the various prostaglandin analogs. Different prostaglandin analogs have disparate binding affinities for the various prostaglandin receptors and different G-protein-coupled receptor interactions, which may result in varying clinical efficacy and safety depending on the target tissue. Differences in formulation, route of administration, effectiveness, and safety may all play a role in deciding which prostaglandin analog to prescribe for an individual patient. Head-to-head studies will be needed to confirm differences in efficacy and safety for the various prostaglandin analogs.",

This study focuses on the ibodutant pharmacodynamic profile at the human NK(2)R and compares it with two other antagonists, nepadutant (MEN11420, (cyclo-[[Asn(beta-D-GlcNAc)-Asp-Trp-Phe-Dpr-Leu]cyclo(2beta-5beta)]) and saredutant [SR48968, (S)-N-methyl-N[4-(4-acetylamino-4-phenylpiperidino)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)butyl]benzamide]. In functional experiments (phosphatidylinositol accumulation) in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human NK(2)R, ibodutant potency measured toward concentration-response curves to neurokinin A as pK(B) was 10.6, and its antagonism mechanism was surmountable and competitive. In the same assay, antagonism equilibration and reversibility experiments of receptor blockade indicated that ibodutant quickly attains equilibrium and that reverts from receptor compartment in a slower manner. Kinetic properties of ibodutant were assessed through competitive binding kinetics experiments performed at [(3)H]nepadutant and [(3)H]saredutant binding sites. Determined K(on) and K(off) values indicated a fast association and slow dissociation rate of ibodutant at the different antagonist binding sites. Last, by radioligand binding experiments at some mutated human tachykinin NK(2)Rs, the amino acidic determinants crucial for the high affinity of ibodutant were identified at the transmembrane (TM) level: Cys167 in TM4; Ile202 and Tyr206 in TM5; Phe270, Tyr266, and Trp263 in TM6; and Tyr289 in TM7. These results indicated an extended antagonist binding pocket in the TM portion of the receptor, which is conceived crucial for TM3 and 6 arrangement and leads to G protein-coupled receptor activation. By combining this information and molecular modeling, the docking mode of ibodutant-human NK(2)R complex is proposed.",

    "abstract": "Until recently, three classes of medical therapy were available for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)--prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. With the approval of the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat, an additional drug class has become available targeting a distinct molecular target in the same pathway as PDE5 inhibitors. Treatment recommendations currently include the use of all four drug classes to treat PAH, but there is a lack of comparative data for these therapies. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanistic differences between these agents is critical when making treatment decisions. Combination therapy is often used to treat PAH and it is therefore important that physicians understand how the modes of action of these drugs may interact to work as complementary partners, or potentially with unwanted consequences. Furthermore, different patient phenotypes mean that patients respond differently to treatment; while a certain monotherapy may be adequate for some patients, for others it will be important to consider alternating or combining compounds with different molecular targets. This review describes how the four currently approved drug classes target the complex pathobiology of PAH and will consider the distinct target molecules of each drug class, their modes of action, and review the pivotal clinical trial data supporting their use. It will also discuss the rationale for combining drugs (or not) from the different classes, and review the clinical data from studies on combination therapy.",

    "title": "Beta-lactam antibiotics induce a lethal malfunctioning of the bacterial cell wall synthesis machinery.",
    "abstract": "Penicillin and related beta-lactams comprise one of our oldest and most widely used antibiotic therapies. These drugs have long been known to target enzymes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that build the bacterial cell wall. Investigating the downstream consequences of target inhibition and how they contribute to the lethal action of these important drugs, we demonstrate that beta-lactams do more than just inhibit the PBPs as is commonly believed. Rather, they induce a toxic malfunctioning of their target biosynthetic machinery involving a futile cycle of cell wall synthesis and degradation, thereby depleting cellular resources and bolstering their killing activity. Characterization of this mode of action additionally revealed a quality control function for enzymes that cleave bonds in the cell wall matrix. The results thus provide insight into the mechanism of cell wall assembly and suggest how best to interfere with the process for future antibiotic development.",

    "abstract": "The plant-derived steroid, digoxin, a specific inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase, has been used for centuries in the treatment of heart disease. Recent studies demonstrate the presence of a digoxin analog, ouabain, in mammalian tissue, but its biological role has not been elucidated. Here, we show in renal epithelial cells that ouabain, in doses causing only partial Na,K-ATPase inhibition, acts as a biological inducer of regular, low-frequency intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) oscillations that elicit activation of the transcription factor, NF-kappa B. Partial inhibition of Na,K-ATPase using low extracellular K(+) and depolarization of cells did not have these effects. Incubation of cells in Ca(2+)-free media, inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels, inositol triphosphate receptor antagonism, and redistribution of actin to a thick layer adjacent to the plasma membrane abolished [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations, indicating that they were caused by a concerted action of inositol triphosphate receptors and capacitative calcium entry via plasma membrane channels. Blockade of ouabain-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations prevented activation of NF-kappa B. The results demonstrate a new mechanism for steroid signaling via plasma membrane receptors and underline a novel role for the steroid hormone, ouabain, as a physiological inducer of [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations involved in transcriptional regulation in mammalian cells.",

    "title": "Gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibits the induction of nitric-oxide synthase in human astrocytes.",
    "abstract": "Gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibited cytokine-induced production of NO and the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astrocytes. Similar to gemfibrozil, clofibrate, another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of iNOS. Inhibition of human iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity by gemfibrozil in cytokine-stimulated U373MG astroglial cells suggests that this compound inhibits the transcription of iNOS. Since gemfibrozil is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), we investigated the role of PPAR-alpha in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS. Gemfibrozil induced peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE)-dependent luciferase activity, which was inhibited by the expression of DeltahPPAR-alpha, the dominant-negative mutant of human PPAR-alpha. However, DeltahPPAR-alpha was unable to abrogate gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits iNOS independent of PPAR-alpha. The human iNOS promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) binding to gamma-activation site (GAS), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta); therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these transcription factors. The combination of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IFN-gamma induced the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, C/EBPbeta, and GAS but not that of ISRE, suggesting that IRF-1 may not be involved in cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in human astrocytes. Interestingly, gemfibrozil strongly inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta but not that of GAS in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells. These results suggest that gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of iNOS probably by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "17Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17beta-HSD1) catalyzes the reduction of estrone into estradiol, which is the most potent estrogen in humans. Lowering intracellular estradiol concentration by inhibition of this enzyme is a promising new option for the treatment of estrogen-dependent diseases like breast cancer and endometriosis. Combination of ligand- and structure-based design resulted in heterocyclic substituted biphenylols and their aza-analogs as new 17beta-HSD1 inhibitors. The design was based on mimicking estrone, especially focusing on the imitation of the D-ring keto group with (substituted) heterocycles. Molecular docking provided insights into plausible protein-ligand interactions for this class of compounds. The most promising compound 12 showed an inhibitory activity in the high nanomolar range and very low affinity for the estrogen receptors alpha and beta. Thus, compound 12 is a novel tool for the elucidation of the pharmacological relevance of 17beta-HSD1 and might be a lead for the treatment of estrogen-dependent diseases.",

Its activity is very similar to that of cefamandole, a second-generation cephalosporin, except that ceforanide is less active against most gram-positive organisms. Many coliforms, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus, are susceptible to ceforanide, as are most strains of Salmonella, Shigella, Hemophilus, Citrobacter and Arizona species. However, most strains of Serratia marcescens and all Pseudomonas aeruginosa are resistant to this compound. Peak serum concentrations in excess of 100 micrograms/ml are achieved after a 1 g intravenous dose. The elimination half-life of ceforanide is about 3 hrs in patients with normal renal function; this allows twice daily dosing for the majority of patients. As renal excretion amounts for 85-90% of drug elimination, the serum half-life increases to approximately 20 hours in anuric patients. Tissue penetration studies demonstrate inhibitory concentrations in cardiac tissue, bone, and joint fluid. Minor adverse effects have been reported after large doses of ceforanide. Clinical trials indicate that ceforanide is effective in the treatment of skin and soft tissue, pulmonary and urinary tract infections, bone and joint infections, and endocarditis. Ceforanide also has been shown to be as effective as cephalothin or cephaloridine when given prophylactically for vaginal hysterectomy.",

    "abstract": "In this study we investigated the pharmacological properties of MEN 11149, 2-(2-naphthyl)-1-N-[(1R,2S)-2-N-[1(H)indol-3-ylcarbonyl]aminocy clohexanecarbonyl]-1-[N'-methyl-N'-(4-methylphenylacetyl)]di aminoethane, a novel partially retro-inverse pseudo peptide antagonist of tachykinin NK1 receptors. MEN 11149 potently inhibits the binding of [3H]substance P to tachykinin NK1 sites in IM9 cells (pKi = 8.5 +/- 0.1). The compound is highly specific for the human tachykinin NK1 receptors, since it has negligible effects (pKi &lt; 6) on the binding of specific ligands to tachykinin NK2, NK3 receptors and a battery of central and peripheral receptors or ion channels. The tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonism of MEN 11149 appears to be insurmountable since, in saturation binding experiments, both K(D) and Bmax are significantly affected by incubation with the compound (1-30 nM). In isolated guinea-pig ileum, MEN 11149 (0.1-100 nM) shifts to the right in a non-parallel way the substance P methyl ester-induced cumulative concentration-response curve with progressive inhibition of the maximal response (pK(B) = 9.6 +/- 0.1). When tested for reversibility at 5 nM in the same preparation, the compound displays a slow dissociation rate compared to the fast dissociation rate with FK888 (N2-[(4R)-4-hydroxy-1-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)carbonyl-L-prolyl]-N-methy l-N-phenylmethyl-L-3-(2-naphthyl)alaninamide) at 5 nM. In the same preparation, MEN 11149 (10 microM) did not affect the cumulative concentration-response curve to acetylcholine. In vivo, MEN 11149 dose dependently antagonizes [Sar9,Met(O2)11]substance P-induced bronchoconstriction in anaesthetized guinea-pigs (ID50 = 83 +/- 31 nmol/kg i.v.). The duration of the effect exceeds 3 h. MEN 11149 does not affect the bronchoconstriction induced by neurokinin A. The compound dose dependently inhibits [Sar9,Met(O2)11]substance P-induced plasma protein extravasation in guinea-pig bronchi whether administered intravenously (ID50 = 0.22 +/- 0.02 micromol/kg) or orally (ID50 = 0.97 +/- 0.21 micromol/kg). These results demonstrate that MEN 11149 is a potent, highly selective and orally effective insurmountable antagonist of tachykinin NK1 receptors with a long duration of action.",

    "abstract": "We examined the effect of (+/-)-gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG, Vigabatrin), an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme GABA transaminase, on the acquisition and expression of cocaine-induced sensitization in albino male Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals received a single injection of 1 ml/kg i.p. of 0.9% saline or 15 mg/kg i.p. of (-)-cocaine and locomotor activity was assessed using automated locomotor cages and stereotyped behaviors were scored using a 4-point rating scale (Day 1). Subsequently, animals were given 15 mg/kg i.p. of cocaine every 48 h in their home cage for 1 week (Days 3, 5, and 7) and then given no treatment for 1 week. A challenge injection of 15 mg/kg i.p. of cocaine, but not vehicle, produced a significant increase in locomotor activity and stereotyped behaviors on Day 15 compared to animals that received cocaine on Day 1. Administration of 75 mg/kg i.p. of GVG 2.5 h before the cocaine injections did not significantly alter the acquisition of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. However, 150 mg/kg i.p. of GVG significantly attenuated the acquisition of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Administration of 150 mg/kg i.p. of GVG 2.5 h before the cocaine challenge injection on Day 15 significantly attenuated the expression of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Acquisition and expression of cocaine-induced sensitization of stereotypy was also significantly attenuated by 150 mg/kg i.p. of GVG. Since sensitization may be one of the factors involved in relapse to drug use, the present results, in combination with previous findings that GVG blocks the rewarding and incentive motivating effects of cocaine, suggest that GVG might prove useful in the treatment of cocaine addiction.",

    "abstract": "CH-1504, being developed by Chelsea Therapeutics Inc under license from the University of South Alabama, is an orally available, metabolically inert antifolate, for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). CH-1504 is an analog of methotrexate (MTX) but differs from the classical antifolates because of an improved safety and tolerability profile. A significant proportion of the toxicity profile of MTX can be attributed to its polyglutamylated and hydroxylated metabolites; therefore, metabolism-blocked antifolates, such as CH-1504, have been designed to prevent the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Preclinical studies and phase II clinical trials indicated that CH-1504 and MTX inhibit dihydrofolate reductase activity with equal potency. In a phase II, proof-of-concept trial in patients with RA, CH-1504 was associated with improved tolerability and reduced hepatotoxicity as compared with MTX; in addition, improvements in the American College of Rheumatology response rates were similar following treatment with either CH-1504 or MTX. Furthermore, Chelsea Therapeutics are developing the L-isomer of CH-1504, CH-4051, which displays improved in vitro potency over with racemate and appears to be Chelsea Therapeutics' preferred candidate for future development. Inert antifolates appear to be a promising drug class for the treatment of RA because the disease-modifying properties of MTX are retained, but the therapeutic window of the inert antifolates is improved. However, further trials are required to establish the efficacy and long-term safety in a wider population of patients with RA.",

These antitumor drugs have significantly different clinical properties, yet they differ chemically by only the additional hydroxyl at C14 of adriamycin. In these complexes the chromophore is intercalated at the CpG steps at either end of the DNA helix with the amino sugar extended into the minor groove. Solution of the structure of daunomycin bound to d(CGATCG) has made it possible to compare it with the previously reported structure of daunomycin bound to d(CGTACG). Although the two daunomycin complexes are similar, there is an interesting sequence dependence of the binding of the amino sugar to the A-T base pair outside the intercalation site. The complex of daunomycin with d(CGATCG) has tighter binding than the complex with d(CGTACG), leading us to infer a sequence preference in the binding of this anthracycline drug. The structures of daunomycin and adriamycin with d(CGATCG) are very similar. However, there are additional solvent interactions with the adriamycin C14 hydroxyl linking it to the DNA. Surprisingly, under the influence of the altered solvation, there is considerable difference in the conformation of spermine in these two complexes. The observed changes in the overall structures of the ternary complexes amplify the small chemical differences between these two antibiotics and provide a possible explanation for the significantly different clinical activities of these important drugs.",

    "abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was the first human malignant disease to be linked to a single, acquired genetic abnormality. Identification of the Bcr-Abl kinase fusion protein and its pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CML provided new opportunities to develop molecular-targeted therapies. Imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), which specifically inhibits the autophosphorylation of the Abl TK, has improved the treatment of CML. However, resistance is often reported in patients with advanced-stage disease. Several novel TK inhibitors have been developed that override IM resistance mechanisms caused by point mutations within the Abl kinase domain. Inhibitors of Abl TK are divided into two main groups, namely, ATP-competitive and ATP noncompetitive inhibitors. The ATP-competitive inhibitors fall into two subclasses, the Src/Abl inhibitors, and the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine-based compounds. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825), AP23464, SKI-606, and PD166326 are classified as Src/Abl inhibitors, while nilotinib (AMN107) and INNO-406 (NS-187) belong to the latter subclass of inhibitors. Of these agents, dasatinib and nilotinib underwent clinical trials earlier than the others and favorable results are now accumulating. Clinical studies of the other compounds, including SKI-606 and INNO-406, have been performed in rapid succession. Because of their strong affinities for the ATP-binding site compared to IM, most ATP-competitive inhibitors may be effective in IM-resistant patients. However, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that can inhibit the phosphorylation of T315I Bcr-Abl has not yet been developed. Instead, ATP noncompetitive inhibitors, such as ON012380, Aurora kinase inhibitor MK0457 (VX-680), and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor BIRB-796, have been developed to address this problem. This review provides an update on the underlying pathophysiologies of disease progression and IM resistance, and discusses the development of new targeted TK inhibitors for managing CML and the importance of future strategies targeting CML stem cells.",

We have determined the regional kinetics and pharmacological profile of [3H]naltriben in vivo in mouse brain. After i.v. administration to CD1 mice, [3H]naltriben uptake and retention were high in striatum, cortical regions and olfactory tubercles, and low in superior colliculi and cerebellum. Robust rank order correlation was found between [3H]naltriben uptake in discrete brain regions and prior delta-opioid receptor binding determinations in vitro and in vivo. [3H]Naltriben binding in vivo was saturable, and was blocked by the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole, but not by the mu-opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime or the K-opioid receptor agonist (trans)-(+/-)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]ben zeneacetamide mesylate (U50,488H). (E)-7-Benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX), a selective antagonist for the putative delta1-opioid receptor, was 9.6- to 12.9-fold less potent than naltriben as an inhibitor of [3H]naltriben binding. Thus, the sites labeled by [3H]naltriben in vivo may correspond to the delta2-opioid receptor subtype. Such assignment is not definitive, particularly considering the 4-fold higher brain uptake of naltriben as compared to (E)-7-benzylidenenaltrexone. Moreover, the regional distribution of [3H]naltriben in brains from CXB-7/BY (CXBK) mice, a strain that shows supraspinal delta1- but not delta2-opioid receptor agonist effects, was quite similar to that found for CD1 mice.",

Reactive microglia are found in increased numbers in aging brain and are prominently associated with lesions in such age-related degenerative conditions as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In vitro, stimulated microglia or microglial-like cells secrete neurotoxic materials and are generators of free radicals through their respiratory burst system. Agents that suppress microglial activation are therefore candidates for neuroprotection. We have developed quantitative in vitro assays for measuring neurotoxicity of microglia or other mononuclear phagocytes. Neuronal like SH-SY5Y cells are cultured in supernatants from activated cells of the human monocytic THP-1 line and their survival is followed. Respiratory burst is directly measured on the activated cells. We tested inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase (COX) or the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathways as possible neuroprotective agents. The COX pathway generates inflammatory prostaglandins, while the 5-LOX pathway generates inflammatory leukotrienes. We found that inhibitors of both these pathways suppressed neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion. They included the COX-1 inhibitor indomethacin; the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398; the mixed COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor ibuprofen; the nitric oxide (NO) derivatives of indomethacin, ibuprofen and flurbiprofen; the 5-LOX inhibitor REV 5901; and the 5-LOX activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor MK-886. The FLAP inhibitor also reduced respiratory burst activity in a more potent manner than indomethacin. Combinations of COX and 5-LOX inhibitors were more effective than single inhibitors. The data suggest that both COX inhibitors and 5-LOX inhibitors may be neuroprotective in vivo by suppressing toxic actions of microglia/macrophages, and that combinations of the two might have greater therapeutic potential than single inhibitors of either class.",

    "title": "Clinical pharmacology of neuromuscular blocking agents.",
    "abstract": "The clinical pharmacology of neuromuscular blocking agents is described. During neuromuscular blockade, succinylcholine attaches to receptors in the motor end plate and depolarizes the neuromuscular junction, making the end plate refractory to acetylcholine. The nondepolarizing relaxants have a structure similar to that of succinylcholine and bind to the same receptors. Instead of depolarizing the junction, they block acetylcholine from binding to the receptor and cause channel blockade. As the concentration of nondepolarizing relaxant increases relative to acetylcholine, neuromuscular transmission is compromised. This relationship is used clinically to facilitate recovery from nondepolarizing agents. Succinylcholine is popular because its onset is faster than that of the nondepolarizing relaxants and metabolism by pseudocholinesterase clears it quickly. It is commonly given as an i.v. bolus to facilitate tracheal intubation. The onset of these agents varies widely and is dose dependent. Large doses are usually given to hasten the onset of paralysis; subsequent doses are adjusted according to response. The nondepolarizing agents interact with inhaled anesthetics, magnesium, and many antimicrobials. Drugs like neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine antagonize neuromuscular blockade; an anticholinergic drug is typically administered to counteract the cardiovascular effects. The most serious adverse effects of succinylcholine are malignant hyperthermia syndrome, masseter muscle rigidity, and bradycardia. Some nondepolarizing relaxants (atracurium, mivacurium, and pancuronium) are associated with histamine release, occasionally causing serious hypotension and tachycardia. Neuromuscular blocking agents are essential to anesthesia. Older compounds produce greater toxicity than newer compounds, and several of these older compounds therefore are no longer in clinical use.",

    "abstract": "The pharmacological properties of FK 739, a new angiotensin II-receptor antagonist, were examined. FK 739 inhibited the specific binding of [125I]-angiotensin II to rat aortic smooth muscle cell membrane with an IC50 value of 8.6 nM, but did not displace the specific binding of [125I]-angiotensin II to bovine cerebellum membrane. In isolated helical strips of rabbit aorta, FK 739 shifted the concentration-response curve of angiotensin II-induced contraction in parallel to the right, and the values of the slope and pA2 were 1.06 and 8.45, respectively. In in vivo studies, oral administration of FK 739 at 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited the angiotensin I-induced pressor response in normotensive rats and dogs, and it caused a fall of mean blood pressure in renal hypertensive rats and dogs. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, FK 739 at 32 and 100 mg/kg significantly decreased the mean blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, we studied whether FK 739 would cause side effects such as dry cough, like other ACE inhibitors did. Oral administration of FK 739 (10 and 32 mg/kg) did not affect the capsaicin-induced bronchial edema. On the other hand, captopril (10 mg/kg) significantly enhanced capsaicin-induced bronchial edema. These results indicate that FK 739 is a potent and competitive antagonist for AT1-type receptors, and suggest that FK 739 might be a safe and useful agent for the treatment of hypertension in clinical trials.",

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Serum and pleural fluid specimens were serially collected at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min after antibiotic administration for measurement of antibiotic levels. We investigated each agent alone as well as drug solutions containing each agent and a dehydropeptidase-I-specific inhibitor, cilastatin (CS), to remove the influence of dehydropeptidase-I-related hydrolysis. Groups of animals (n=3) received each carbapenem agent with or without CS. Serum and pleural fluid antibiotic levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Because Cmax is not useful for evaluating the antimicrobial effects of carbapenem antibiotic agents due to their dose-dependent antimicrobial activity, we also investigated the AUC, which is correlated with the total drug levels in vivo. Among the drug solutions containing CS, MEPM/CS had the highest pleural fluid AUC0-360 (1594.8+/-510.3 microg min/ml), and the highest pleural fluid AUC0-360/plasma AUC0-360 ratio (0.79+/-0.04). BIPM/CS had the highest plasma AUC0-360 (3040.1+/-1525.9 microg min/ml). In pleural fluid AUC0-360/plasma AUC0-360 ratio MEPM/CS was significantly higher than those for the remaining agents. In pleural fluid AUC0-360 and plasma AUC0-360 there were no significant differences among these mixed solutions. CONCLUSIONS: MEPM had the most favorable pleural fluid penetration. Pleural fluid penetration should be examined in infection models and in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Two G protein-coupled neurotensin (NT) receptors, termed NTR1 and NTR2, have been identified so far. In contrast to the NTR1, which has been extensively studied, little is known about the pharmacological and biological properties of the NTR2. In the course of characterizing NT analogs that exhibited binding selectivity for the NTR2, we discovered that this receptor constitutively activated inositol phosphate (IP) production. Here, we report on the constitutive activity of the human NTR2 (hNTR2) transfected in COS cells and on compounds that exhibit agonism, inverse agonism, and neutral antagonism at this receptor. IP levels increased linearly with time, whereas they remained constant in mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, IP production was proportional to the amount of hNTR2 present at the cell membrane. SR 48692, a nonpeptide antagonist of the NTR1, stimulated IP production, whereas levocabastine, a nonpeptide histamine H1 antagonist that binds the NTR2 but not the NTR1, behaved as a weak partial inverse agonist. NT analogs modified at position 11 of the NT molecule, in particular by the introduction of bulky aromatic D amino acids, exhibited binding selectivity at the hNTR2 and also behaved as partial inverse agonists, reversing constitutive IP production up to 50%. Finally, NT barely affected constitutive IP production but antagonized the effects of both agonist and inverse agonist compounds, thus behaving as a neutral antagonist. The unique pharmacological profile of the hNTR2 is discussed in the light of its sequence similarity with the NTR1 and the known binding site topology of NT and SR 48692 in the NTR1.",

    "abstract": "1. Minocycline has anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects on cartilage, neurons and periodontal tissues, and both properties are central to the pharmaceutical treatment of liver diseases. We investigated the effects of minocycline on fulminant hepatitis in C57BL/6J mice induced by lethal challenge of the activating anti-Fas antibody, Jo2. 2. Intraperitoneal injection of Jo2 (0.6 microg g(-1)) to mice resulted in fulminant hepatitis, as evidenced by increase of serum alanine/aspartate transaminase activities and histopathological alterations in liver sections, as well as animal death. Nevertheless, mice pretreated with three doses of minocycline (5 mg kg(-1)) resisted this lethal effect significantly. Minocycline treatment improved the survival kinetics, although to a lesser extent, when mice were challenged simultaneously with Jo2 or even treated 30 min after the lethal challenge. 3. Jo2-induced activation of caspase-3 or -9 in liver tissues was inhibited by minocycline pretreatment, and yet the direct addition of minocycline to liver extracts from Jo2-challenged mice failed to block caspase activation in vitro. Moreover, minocycline efficiently suppressed the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria of the liver tissues from Jo2-challenged mice. In contrast, caspase-8 activation and Bid truncation triggered by Jo2 were not diminished by minocycline pretreatment in mouse livers. 4. Our results suggest that easing of Fas-triggered fulminant hepatitis by minocycline may involve a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, probably through preventing cytochrome c release and thereby blocking downstream caspase activation.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of novel, selective inhibitors of isoenzyme 1 of human 5alpha-reductase (5alphaR) (EC 1.3.99.5) are reported. The inhibitors are 4aH- (19-29) or 1H-tetrahydrobenzo[c]quinolizin-3-ones (35-47) bearing at positions 1, 4, 5, and 6 a methyl group and at position 8 a hydrogen, methyl group, or chlorine atom. All these compounds were tested toward 5alphaR-1 and 5alphaR-2 expressed in CHO cells (CHO 1827 and CHO 1829, respectively) resulting in selective inhibitors of the type 1 isoenzyme, with inhibitory potencies (IC(50)) ranging from 7.6 to 9100 nM. The inhibitors of the 4aH-series, having a double bond at position 1,2, were generally less active than the corresponding inhibitors of the 1H-series having the double bond at position 4,4a on the A ring. The presence of a methyl group at position 4 (as in compounds 39-40 and 45-47), associated with a substituent at position 8, determined the highest inhibition potency (IC(50) from 7.6 to 20 nM). Compounds 39 and 40, having K(i) values of 5.8+/-1.8 and 2.7+/-0.6 nM, respectively, toward 5alphaR-1 expressed in CHO cells, were also tested toward native 5alphaR-1 in human scalp and 5alphaR-2 in human prostate homogenates, in comparison with finasteride and the known 5alphaR-1-selective inhibitor LY191704, and their mechanism of inhibition was determined. They both inhibited the enzyme through a reversible competitive mechanism and again were selective inhibitors of 5alphaR-1 with IC(50) values of 41 nM. These specific features make these inhibitors suitable candidates for further development as drugs in the treatment of DHT-dependent disorders such as acne and androgenic alopecia in men and hirsutism in women.",

    "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are currently considered a first-line treatment of renal colic. Their action has been ascribed to the inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis, which decreases renal blood flow and diuresis, and consequently lowers the pressure in the renal pelvis and ureter. However, the effects of NSAIDs on induced contractions of ureteral smooth muscle have received little attention. Also, there is a lack of clinically relevant spasmolytic drugs for the ureter. Therefore, we studied the influence of the non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor diclofenac, a NSAID drug customarily used in the treatment of renal colic, and of NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, on induced contractions of the pig ureter. Serotonin (0.1-30 microM), norepinephrine (0.1-30 microM) and neurokinin A (0.03-10 microM) induced reproducible concentration-dependent contractions, which were inhibited by diclofenac and NS-398 (10-300 microM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The sensitivity of neurokinin A-induced contractions to diclofenac was 3-4 times greater than that of the amines. Depending on the concentration, inhibition ranged between 25 and 96% of the initially induced contractile activity. In the presence of inhibitors, supramaximal concentrations of agonists were unable to trigger recuperation of the initially induced contractions. Prostaglandin F2alpha did not reverse the effect of diclofenac on agonist-induced contractions. Removal of diclofenac or NS-398 from the organ baths showed that the inhibition was totally reversible. Thus, the non-selective COX inhibitor diclofenac and the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 are almost equipotent in reducing agonist-induced contractions in the isolated porcine ureter. Although the clinical relevance of this spasmolytic effect remains to be demonstrated, the data suggest that patients suffering from renal colic may benefit not only from the anti-diuretic and analgesic effects of diclofenac, but also from its potential spasmolytic properties. Moreover, selective COX-2 inhibitors may have clinical potential, as they may cause fewer side effects.",

Nine patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery under spinal anaesthesia completed the study. The concentrations of both substances were much lower in CSF than in plasma, the ratio CSF/plasma being 0.09 for bambuterol and 0.19 for terbutaline, at apparent steady state. While the rank order of the ratios was expected from the fractions of unbound bambuterol and terbutaline in plasma, their absolute values were only about 1/6 (bambuterol) and 1/4 (terbutaline) of those predicted from diffusion equilibria between plasma and CSF. Thus, the rates of transport of bambuterol and terbutaline from plasma into the central nervous system appear to be slow relative to transport out of the system, e.g. by outflow of CSF. The findings are in agreement with animal experiments and suggest that bambuterol and terbutaline are less likely than lipophilic beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists to interact with central receptors.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the mosaic structure of penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP 2), composed of fragments of PBP 2 from Neisseria cinerea and Neisseria perflava, was significantly associated with decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins, particularly oral cephalosporins. The aim of this study was to determine the affinity of mosaic PBP 2 for cephalosporins in N. gonorrhoeae. METHODS: Two types of non-mosaic PBP 2 from the type strain of N. gonorrhoeae (ATCC 19424) and a clinical strain (GU01-29), as well as the mosaic PBP 2 from a clinical strain (GU01-89), were expressed in insect cells, and recombinant PBP 2s were purified. ATCC 19424 and GU01-29 were susceptible to cephalosporins. GU01-89 showed decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins. Bindings of fluorescent penicillin to PBP 2 were characterized by the Scatchard plot analysis. The affinity of the recombinant PBP 2s for cefdinir, cefixime and ceftriaxone was determined by PBP 2 competition assays with fluorescent penicillin. RESULTS: The K(d) value of mosaic PBP 2 for fluorescent penicillin was higher than that of non-mosaic PBP 2s. The affinity of mosaic PBP 2 for cefdinir or cefixime was lower than that of the non-mosaic PBP 2s. The affinity of the mosaic PBP 2 for ceftriaxone was not changed, compared with that of the non-mosaic PBP 2s. CONCLUSIONS: Other mechanisms may be involved in clinical isolates with decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins, but this study suggests that the decreased affinity of mosaic-structure recombinant PBP 2 for oral cephalosporins may contribute to decreased susceptibility to these antibiotics in N. gonorrhoeae.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The pharmacology, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects and toxicities, drug interactions, dosage and administration, and safety issues related to the use of conivaptan are discussed. SUMMARY: Conivaptan hydrochloride is a nonpeptide, V1A and V2 vasopressin-receptor antagonist. It is available as an i.v. formulation in 4-mL ampules containing 20 mg of conivaptan hydrochloride. The drug is active both orally and i.v. Conivaptan injection is approved for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. Three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter studies have been conducted in the United States and internationally. The studies used various dosing regimens for conivaptan but maintained the same efficacy endpoints. Each study showed conivaptan to be effective in increasing serum sodium and in water clearance. Conivaptan is being evaluated in the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure and chronic heart failure, but the safety of this drug has not been fully established. The drug has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials with both oral and i.v. administration. The approved dosing regimen consists of a 20-mg i.v. loading dose administered over 30 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg administered over 24 hours. Clinical studies evaluating conivaptan have been short term; longer-term effects of hemodynamic parameters are unknown. CONCLUSION: Conivaptan, the first vasopressin antagonist approved for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia, has a unique mechanism of action that results in free-water excretion and offers a new option for the treatment of resistant hyponatremia in the acute setting when patients have not responded to standard management.",

    "abstract": "n-Butyl-p-aminobenzoate (BAB; butamben) is a long-duration anesthetic used for the treatment of chronic pain. Epidural administration of BAB is thought to reduce the electrical excitability of dorsal root nociceptor fibers by inhibiting voltage-gated ion channels. To further investigate this mechanism, we examined the effects of BAB on the potassium currents of acutely dissociated neurons from the rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG). These neurons express a rapidly inactivating A-type K(+) current (I(A)) that is resistant to tetraethylammonium (20 mM) but inhibited by 4-aminopyridine (5 mM). At low concentrations, BAB (&lt; or =1 microM) selectively inhibited the I(A) component of DRG K(+) current. The voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, kinetics of recovery from inactivation, and the pharmacology of the DRG I(A) were similar to those of the Kv4 family of K(+) channels. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to establish that the messages encoding for all three of the mammalian Kv4 channel subunits (Kv4.1-Kv4.3) were present in the rat DRG. BAB produced a high-affinity, partial inhibition of heterologously expressed Kv4.2 channels (K(D) = 59 nM) but did not alter the kinetics or voltage sensitivity of gating. Substituting polar threonines for conserved hydrophobic residues of the S6 segment weakened BAB binding but did not alter the voltage-dependent gating of the Kv4.2 channel. At physiological pH, BAB is uncharged, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions may contribute to drug binding. The data support a mechanism in which BAB binds near the narrow cytoplasmic entrance of Kv4 channels and inhibits current by a pore blocking mechanism.",

    "abstract": "OBJECT: Intrathecally administered alpha2-adrenergic receptor subtype-specific antagonists were used to determine which alpha2-adrenergic receptor subtype mediates the analgesic effect of intrathecally administered tizanidine in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) rat model of neuropathic pain. METHODS: Seven days after CCI and intrathecal catheter surgeries had been performed in Sprague-Dawley rats, baseline neuropathic pain tests including cold-floor ambulation and paw pinch were performed. Either the dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle (seven rats) or one of the antagonists--5, 23, or 46 microg yohimbine (22 rats); 5, 25, 50, or 100 microg prazosin (25 rats); or 5, 45, or 90 microg WB4101 (11 rats)--were intrathecally administered to the animals, followed in 30 minutes by 50 microg intrathecally administered tizanidine. The neuropathic pain tests were repeated 30 minutes later. The resulting profile showed a descending order of antagonist efficacy for yohimbine, prazosin, and WB4101 for the cold-floor ambulation test and for the paw-pinch test of the affected paw. As expected given tizanidine's lack of analgesic effect on the contralateral, normal paw, there were no effects of antagonists on contralateral paw responses. The results of the paw-pinch test on the affected side were compared with binding data cited in the existing literature for the three different alpha2-adrenergic receptor subtypes (alpha2A, alpha2B, and alpha2C) with yohimbine, prazosin, and WB4101. The antagonist response profile for the paw-pinch test of the affected paw most closely approximated the alpha2B receptor binding profile. CONCLUSIONS: The antagonist profile from the current study is most consistent with the theory that the alpha2B-adrenergic receptor subtype mediates the analgesic effect of intrathecally administered tizanidine on CCI-associated neuropathic pain.",

    "abstract": "The cardiovascular effects of three different acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: physostigmine, tacrine and rivastigmine injected by intravenous (i.v.) route were compared in freely moving Wistar rats. The three drugs significantly increased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and decreased heart rate. Compared to physostigmine, a 20-fold higher dose of tacrine and a 40-fold higher dose of rivastigmine was necessary to induce a comparable pressor effect. Tacrine was chosen as a model to study the mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of i.v. cholinesterase inhibitors. Atropine totally abolished while methylatropine did not affect tacrine pressor effects. Conversely, both drugs abolished tacrine-induced bradycardia. The alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin or the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist, [beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopenta-methylenepropionyl1, O-Me-Tyr2, Arg8] vasopressin partially but significantly reduced tacrine pressor effect and mostly abolished it when administered concomitantly. The tacrine pressor response was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the i.c.v. administration of the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (ID50 = 1.45 microg), the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (ID50 = 4.33 microg), the muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist methoctramine (ID50 = 1.39 microg) and the muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (ID50 = 31.19 microg). Central injection of such muscarinic receptor antagonists did not affect tacrine-induced bradycardia. Our results show that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors induce significant cardiovascular effects with a pressor response mediated mainly by the stimulation of central muscarinic M2 receptors inducing a secondary increase in sympathetic outflow and vasopressin release. Conversely, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor-induced bradycardia appears to be mediated by peripheral muscarinic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Repeated administration of many addictive drugs leads to a progressive increase in their locomotor effects. This increase in locomotor activity often develops concomitantly with increases in their positive-reinforcing effects, which are believed to contribute to the etiology of substance use disorders. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in sensitivity to the locomotor effects of opioids after their repeated administration and to determine the role of mu and kappa receptors in mediating these effects. Separate groups of rats were treated with opioid receptor agonists and antagonists every other day for 10 days, and changes in locomotor activity were measured. Repeated administration of the mu agonists, morphine and buprenorphine, produced a progressive increase in locomotor activity during the treatment period, and this effect was blocked by coadministration of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. The kappa agonist spiradoline decreased locomotor activity when administered alone and blocked the progressive increase in locomotor activity produced by morphine. The ability of spiradoline to block morphine-induced increases in locomotor activity was itself blocked by pretreatment with the kappa antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. Repeated administration of high doses, but not low or moderate doses, of the mixed mu/kappa agonists butorphanol, nalbuphine, and nalorphine produced a progressive increase in locomotor activity during the treatment period. Doses of butorphanol, nalbuphine, and nalorphine that failed to produce a progressive increase in locomotor activity when administered alone did so when subjects were pretreated with nor-binaltorphimine. These findings suggest that mu and kappa receptors have functionally opposing effects on opioid-mediated locomotor activity and sensitization-related processes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: IMGN901 (lorvotuzumab mertansine) is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a humanized antibody that specifically binds to CD56 (NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule) and that is conjugated to the maytansinoid, DM1 (a microtubule targeting agent). PROCEDURES: IMGN901 and DM1-SMe (unconjugated DM1 as a mixed disulfide with thiomethane to cap its sulfhydryl group) were tested in vitro at concentrations ranging from 0.01 nM to 0.1 microM and 0.3 pM to 3 nM, respectively. IMGN901 was tested against a subset of PPTP solid tumor xenografts focusing on those with high CD56 expression.The combination of IMGN901 with topotecan was also evaluated. RESULTS: Neuroblastoma models expressed CD56 at or above the median expression level for all PPTP xenografts and cell lines. Neuroblastoma cell lines demonstrated relatively low sensitivity to DM1-SMe compared to other cell lines, but the sensitivity of neuroblastoma cell lines to IMGN901 was comparable to that of non-neuroblastoma cell lines. In vivo, objective responses were observed in 9 of 24 (38%) models including, three of seven neuroblastoma xenografts, and two of seven rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts. All xenografts with objective responses showed homogeneous high-level staining by IHC for CD56, but not all xenografts with homogenous high-level staining had objective responses. Combined with topotecan, IMGN901 demonstrated therapeutic enhancement against two of four neuroblastoma models. CONCLUSIONS: IMGN901 has anti-tumor activity against some CD56 expressing pediatric cancer models. High expression of CD56 is a biomarker for in vivo response, but resistance mechanisms to IMGN901 in some high CD56 expressing lines need to be defined.",

    "abstract": "Endoglin (CD105), a receptor of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, has been reported to identify functional long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells, and has been detected in certain subtypes of acute leukemias. Whether this receptor plays a functional role in leukemogenesis remains unknown. We identified endoglin expression on the majority of blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Using a xenograft model, we find that CD105+ blasts are endowed with superior leukemogenic activity compared with the CD105- population. We test the effect of targeting this receptor using the monoclonal antibody TRC105, and find that in AML, TRC105 prevented the engraftment of primary AML blasts and inhibited leukemia progression following disease establishment, but in B-ALL, TRC105 alone was ineffective due to the shedding of soluble CD105. However, in both B-ALL and AML, TRC105 synergized with reduced intensity myeloablation to inhibit leukemogenesis, indicating that TRC105 may represent a novel therapeutic option for B-ALL and AML.",

    "abstract": "The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex involved in innate immunity. Activation of the inflammasome causes the processing and release of the cytokines interleukins 1beta and 18. In primary macrophages, potassium ion flux and the membrane channel pannexin 1 have been suggested to play roles in inflammasome activation. However, the molecular mechanism(s) governing inflammasome signaling remains poorly defined, and it is undetermined whether these mechanisms apply to the central nervous system. Here we show that high extracellular potassium opens pannexin channels leading to caspase-1 activation in primary neurons and astrocytes. The effect of K(+) on pannexin 1 channels was independent of membrane potential, suggesting that stimulation of inflammasome signaling was mediated by an allosteric effect. The activation of the inflammasome by K(+) was inhibited by the pannexin 1 channel blocker probenecid, supporting a role of pannexin 1 in inflammasome activation. Co-immunoprecipitation of neuronal lysates indicates that pannexin 1 associates with components of the multiprotein inflammasome complex, including the P2X7 receptor and caspase-1. Moreover antibody neutralization of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) blocked ATP-induced cell death in oocytes co-expressing P2X7 receptor and pannexin 1. Thus, in contrast to macrophages and monocytes in which low intracellular K(+) has been suggested to trigger inflammasome activation, in neural cells, high extracellular K(+) activates caspase-1 probably through pannexin 1.",

    "abstract": "8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OHDPAT) has effects both characteristic of a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) agonist and antagonist. To investigate the mechanism(s) of action of 8-OHDPAT in vivo, rats were trained to discriminate 8-OHDPAT (0.4 mg/kg) from saline and given various neuroactive compounds during substitution test sessions. Of the 5-HT agonists tested, d-lysergic acid diethylamide, 5-methoxy-n,n-dimethyltryptamine, quipazine, Ru 24969 and 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine did not mimic the training drug; the dopamine agonists apomorphine and SKF 38393 as well as the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine engendered predominantly saline-lever responding. However, the novel anxiolytics buspirone and ipsapirone as well as the ergot derivative lisuride substituted completely for 8-OHDPAT. In combination tests, 5-HT (ketanserin, metergoline, methysergide, pirenperone), dopamine (haloperidol) and norepinephrine antagonists (prazosin, propranolol) failed to attenuate the 8-OHDPAT cue. The similar stimulus properties of 8-OHDPAT and the novel anxiolytics (buspirone, ipsapirone) are mirrored by the common abilities of these agents to selectively inhibit 5-HT1A binding and release punished responding. Thus, the subpopulation of 5-HT1A receptors may mediate the behavioral effects of these compounds in animals and, in turn, the anxiolytic effects of buspirone and ipsapirone in humans. Although not primarily selective for 5-HT, lisuride may also mimic 8-OHDPAT by direct or indirect stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Several studies in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) have provided circumstantial evidence that the 5-HT-system is involved in the pathophysiology of OCD. To further examine the role of 5-HT receptors we studied the behavioural and neuroendocrine effects of different doses of meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) in OCD patients and healthy controls, after pre-treatment with ritanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, and placebo. DESIGN: Twenty patients and 20 healthy controls received 0.1, 0.3 or 0.5 mg/kg mCPP or placebo orally. Each subject was tested two times, receiving both times the same dosage of mCPP or placebo with ritanserin or placebo pre-treatment. All was done under double-blind conditions. OC-symptoms and hormone levels were measured. RESULTS: The increase in prolactin level after mCPP administration was more robust in patients than in controls. The prolactin response following 0.5 mg/kg of mCPP was partially blocked by ritanserin in patients, but totally blocked in healthy controls. The cortisol responses in both groups did not differ statistically significant from each other and were entirely blocked by ritanserin. None of the subjects experienced an exacerbation of obsessive compulsive symptoms. CONCLUSION: The neuroendocrine results show an enhanced susceptibility of OCD patients for the mCPP-induced prolactin response, which effect seems to be due to an increased sensitivity of 5-HT2 receptors.",

They are 'composites' of the camptothecin and indenoisoquinoline top1 inhibitors. Interestingly, some structure-activity relationship (SAR) overlap between the aromathecins and the indenoisoquinolines has been observed. For both classes, placement of certain polar groups in similar regions of the heteroaromatic system improves top1 inhibitory and antiproliferative activities. A series of water-soluble aromathecins substituted at position 14 with diaminoalkanes of various lengths has been prepared. These compounds all possess similar antiproliferative potency, but a general trend is observed: aromathecins with longer diaminoalkane substituents (&gt;6 carbons) possess lower anti-top1 activity than their smaller counterparts (2-4 carbons), presumably as a result of unfavorable hydrophobic interactions. This trend is also noted with the indenoisoquinolines, revealing additional SAR overlap that supports the hypothesis that there is a 'universal' top1 inhibitor SAR.",

The EPSP, after the electrical stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway, were recorded in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. AVP at 10(-8) M and Z-321 at 10(-4) M augmented the potentiation induced by the weak tetanus; the magnitude of the post-tetanic potentiation of the EPSP was enhanced and the potentiation lasted for 60 min. In contrast, the racemic D-thioprolyl compound of Z-321, which virtually lacks any inhibitory effects on PEP, failed to affect the potentiation at 10(-4) M. The facilitatory effect of Z-321 was reversed by the application of [d(CH2)5,Tyr(Me)2]AVP (10(-8) M), an antagonist of the AVP V1 receptors, indicating that the effect of Z-321 was mediated through the V1 receptors. These findings suggest that Z-321 augmented the potentiation due to its inhibitory influence on the AVP degradation by PEP.",

Dipeptide carnosine transport activity was also confirmed by direct uptake measurement. By in situ hybridization analysis, PHT1 mRNA was widely distributed throughout whole brain. Especially, intense hybridization signals were found in the hippocampus, choroid plexus, cerebellum, and pontine nucleus. Signals were located in both the neuronal and small nonneuronal cells in these areas. PHT1 protein could contribute to uptake of oligopeptides, which function as neuromodulators, and clearance of degraded neuropeptides and be a new member in the growing superfamily of proton-coupled peptide and nitrate transporters, although its structure, localization, and pharmacological characteristics are unique among these members.",

The randomized controlled phases of both studies were closed after interim analyses provided compelling evidence of statistically significant positive efficacy findings and showed no apparent adverse safety findings. Results of the pooled analysis of the two trials showed that conestat alfa provided significantly faster initial relief of symptoms than placebo. The median time to the beginning of relief of symptoms (primary endpoint) was 66 minutes with conestat alfa 100 units/kg, 122 minutes with conestat alfa 50 units/kg, and 495 minutes with placebo. Conestat alfa was also statistically superior to placebo for the secondary endpoint of median time to minimal symptoms, with values of 266, 247, and 1210 minutes for the respective treatment groups. On the basis of data from open-label extension studies and integrated analyses of clinical trial data, conestat alfa has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of repeated HAE attacks and in patients with potentially life-threatening HAE attacks with involvement of the upper airways.

The lowest i.v. dose of N-0861 to antagonize A1 receptor-mediated bradycardia was 0.3 mumol/kg i.v.; the duration of effect ranged from 1 min (following 0.3-1 mumol/kg) to approximately 2.5 h (following 10 mumol/kg). N-0861 is a selective (by greater than or equal to 333-fold) antagonist of adenosine A1 receptors.",

In this study, we report the preclinical validation of 1-bromoacetyl-3,3-dinitroazetidine (ABDNAZ), a representative lead compound currently in a phase I clinical trial in patients with cancer. In tumor cell culture, ABDNAZ generated reactive free radicals in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, modulating intracellular redox status and triggering apoptosis. When administered to mice as a single agent, ABDNAZ exhibited greater cytotoxicity than cisplatin or tirapazamine under hypoxic conditions. However, compared with cisplatin, ABDNAZ was better tolerated at submaximal doses, yielding significant tumor growth inhibition in the absence of systemic toxicity. Similarly, when combined with radiation, ABDNAZ accentuated antitumor efficacy along with the therapeutic index. Toxicity studies indicated that ABDNAZ was not myelosuppressive and no dose-limiting toxicity was apparent following daily administration for 14 days. Taken together, our findings offer preclinical proof-of-concept for ABDNAZ as a promising new anticancer agent with a favorable toxicity profile, either as a chemotherapeutic agent or a radiosensitizer.",

These include reduced alertness, daytime fatigue, loss of appetite, reduced cognitive skills, and disruption of the sleep/wake cycle. In susceptible air travel passengers, jet lag may exacerbate affective illness and result in psychiatric morbidity. Dysregulation of circadian rhythms and melatonin secretion represent the common underlying factor in jet lag and other circadian disorders. Recent studies have established the effectiveness of strategically timed administration of melatonin and appropriate timed exposure to environmental schedules including light in counteracting the dysregulation (chronobiologic actions). With the introduction of melatonergic agonists such as ramelteon and tasimelteon, which have both a stronger affinity for MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors and a longer half-life, new therapeutic options now exist for treating the sleep disturbances associated with jet lag. The melatonin analogs are unique inasmuch as they can also enhance daytime alertness. The recently introduced melatonergic antidepressant agomelatine, which has established its supremacy over other antidepressants in having a significant chronobiologic activity, represents a good choice for treating depressive symptoms that are associated with jet lag.",

It is especially effective against MMP-2 and -9 more so than other MMP inhibitors such as Marimastat, Ro 32-3555 and D-2163. Here, we investigated the anti-tumor efficacy of FYK-1388 using the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080. These cells produced MMP-2 and -9, which FYK-1388 inhibited at a dose of 10(-8) M. FYK-1388 at 0.2 mg/mouse/day significantly suppressed tumor growth when given by s.c. injection for 22 days, experimental lung metastasis after 5 days s.c. injection and also suppressed tumor-induced angiogenesis in the dorsal air sac assay after 7 days s.c. injection. In the MTT assay, FYK-1388 had no effect on the in vitro growth of HT-1080 cells. These results suggest that FYK-1388 possesses anti-tumor efficacy as a result of inhibiting angiogenesis through the suppression of MMP-2 and -9 activity.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Mesalazine has been identified as a candidate chemopreventive agent in colon cancer prophylaxis because of its pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects. However, the precise mechanisms of action are not entirely understood. The aim of our study was to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in mesalazine's anticarcinogenic actions in colorectal cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects of mesalazine on cell cycle distribution, cell count, proliferation and caspase-mediated apoptosis were examined in Caco-2, HT-29 and HCT-116 cells used as wild-type, dominant-negative PPARgamma mutant and empty vector cultures. We focused on caspase-3 activity, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-8 and caspase-9, as well as on expression of survivin, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (Xiap), phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome ten (PTEN) and c-Myc. Techniques employed included transfection assays, immunoblotting, flow cytometry analysis, colorimetric and fluorometric assays. RESULTS: Mesalazine caused a time- and dose-dependent decrease in both cell growth and proliferation. Growth inhibition was accompanied by a G1/G0 arrest, a significant increase in PTEN, caspase-3 activity, cleavage of PARP and caspase-8, whereas the expressions of Xiap, survivin and c-Myc were decreased simultaneously. Cleavage of caspase-9 was not observed. Moreover, PPARgamma expression and activity were elevated. The growth-inhibitory effect of mesalazine was partially reduced in dominant-negative PPARgamma mutant cells, whereas the expression of c-Myc was not affected. Mesalazine-mediated increased caspase-3 activity, the expression of PTEN, cleavage of PARP and caspase-8 as well as reduced levels of survivin and Xiap were completely abolished in the PPARgamma mutant cell lines. CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrates that mesalazine-mediated pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative actions are regulated via PPARgamma-dependent and -independent pathways in colonocytes.",

Melatonin exerts its multiple roles mainly through two seven transmembrane domain, G-coupled receptors, namely MT1 or MT2 receptors. A pharmacological characterization of these human cloned melatonin hMT1 and hMT2 receptors stably expressed in HEK-293 or CHO cells is presented using a 2-[125I]-iodo-melatonin binding assay and a [35S]-GTPgammaS functional assay. Both reference compounds and new chemically diverse ligands were evaluated. Binding affinities at each receptor were found to be comparable on either HEK-293 or CHO cell membranes. Novel non-selective or selective hMT1 and hMT2 ligands are described. The [35S]-GTPgammaS functional assay was used to define the functional activity of these compounds which included partial, full agonist and/or antagonist activity. None of the compounds acted as an inverse agonist. We report new types of selective antagonists, such as S 25567 and S 26131 for MT1 and S 24601 for MT2.

The influence of pH, detergent, gender, drug-metabolizing enzyme inducers, and age were examined. Detergents like the zwitterionic CHAPS and non-ionic Tween 20, Triton X-100, and Brij 35 stimulated the glucuronidation rate by up to 600% of native activity with the latter being most effective. Both apparent Km and Vmax increased following detergent treatment in rat hepatic microsomes. Less marked activation of UDP glucuronosyltransferase activity was observed with Brij 35 in mouse, rabbit, dog, and pig compared with rat. In contrast, human hepatic microsomes were not stimulated by detergent treatment. 3. Marked species-dependent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity were observed for the two compounds. In general, Odapipam exhibited higher Vmax and Km compared with Berupipam with the exception of rabbit where the reverse was true. Similar kinetic parameters were, however, observed in human hepatic microsomes. Highest glucuronidation rate (in general) was observed in mouse followed by dog, pig, rabbit, man, and rat. 4. UGT activity in human livers showed up to a seven-fold variation. Conjugation of each compound were highly correlated (r = 0.92; n = 20) suggesting that identical isoform(s) were involved in this reaction.

    "abstract": "Currently available antioestrogens, such as tamoxifen, are competitive inhibitors that bind to the ligand binding sites of oestrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta. The search for alternative anti-hormone therapies is prompted by the need for drugs that are effective when tumours become tamoxifen resistant. The existence of different receptor isoforms also raise the possibility of improving selectivity. Earlier use of the 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, trilostane (4alpha,5- epoxy-17beta-hydroxy-3-oxo-5alpha-androstane-2alpha-carbonitrile), suggested that it had beneficial actions in breast cancer that were only partially attributable to inhibition of steroidogenesis. The present studies on the interactions of trilostane with oestrogen receptors show that it (i) inhibits oestrogen-stimulated proliferation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, (ii) enhances the affinity of oestradiol binding to ER in rat uteri and specifically increases oestradiol binding to an ERbeta-like isoform, (iii) inhibits ERalpha and ERbeta binding to the classical vitellogenin gene oestrogen response element (ERE) and (iv) inhibits oestrogen-stimulated gene transcription in ERE-linked reporter systems in MCF-7 cells. The results demonstrate a novel, presumably allosteric, mode of antioestrogen action. The beneficial actions of trilostane in breast cancer may be attributed to the combination of this antioestrogen effect with its well documented suppression of steroidogenesis.",

To abrogate VEGF signaling, we developed a small molecular weight inhibitor of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity that was compatible with chronic oral administration. ZD4190, a substituted 4-anilinoquinazoline, is a potent inhibitor of KDR and Flt-1 RTK activity, and VEGF stimulated HUVEC proliferation in vitro. Chronic once-daily oral dosing of ZD4190 to young rats produced a dose-dependent increase in the femoral epiphyseal growth plate area, which may be attributed to the inhibition of VEGF signaling in vivo because vascular invasion of cartilage is a prerequisite to the process of ossification. Once-daily oral dosing of ZD4190 to mice bearing established (approximately 0.5 cm3) human tumor xenografts (breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian) elicited significant antitumor activity and at doses that would not be expected to have any direct antiproliferative effect on tumor cells. Prolonged tumor cytostasis was further demonstrated in a PC-3 xenograft model with 10 weeks of ZD4190 dosing, and upon withdrawal of therapy, tumor growth resumed after a short delay. These observations are entirely consistent with the proposed mode of action. ZD4190 is one of a series of VEGF RTK inhibitors that may have utility in the treatment of a range of histologically diverse solid tumor types.",

    "title": "Oxaprozin: kinetic and dynamic profile in the treatment of pain.",
    "abstract": "Oxaprozin (4,5-diphenyl-2-oxazolepropionic acid) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is effective in models of inflammation, pain and pyrexia. It is effective and well tolerated in the clinical management of adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), ankylosing spondylitis, soft tissue disorders and post operative dental pain. Oxaprozin has a high oral bioavailability (95%), with peak plasma concentrations at 3 to 5 hours after dosing. It is metabolised in the liver by oxidative and conjugative pathways and readily eliminated by the renal and faecal routes. Oxaprozin's strong analgesic qualities are particularly useful in painful musculoskeletal conditions such as periarthritis of the shoulder, since it exhibits actions such as inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes, inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and of metalloproteases, and modulates the endogenous cannabinoid system. This editorial addresses the accompanying paper by Barbara Heller and Rosanna Tarricone on the management of shoulder periarthritis pain, in which they studied the efficacy and safety of oxaprozin compared to the comparator drug diclofenac over a 15 day period. Both oxaprozin and diclofenac compared well in the primary study endpoint of reduction in shoulder pain. Oxaprozin and diclofenac were well tolerated and oxaprozin showed better improvement in shoulder function and in the mental health item of the SF-36 quality of life component. The study by Heller and Tarricone is an addition to the large number of clinical trials which demonstrate that oxaprozin has equal efficacy in comparison with standard doses of commonly used anti-rheumatic agents such as aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin etc. in several different painful musculoskeletal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common head and neck malignancies and exhibits regional differences in incidence. Because many fusion genes have been discovered in different types of tumors over the past few years, we aimed to investigate the existence of a fusion gene in primary NPC patients using RNA-seq. In this study, for the first time, we found that fibroblast growth factor receptor 3-transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein 3 (FGFR3-TACC3) fusion transcripts are recurrently detected in NPC. The presence of this fusion gene was also detected in head and neck cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and lung cancer. Furthermore, we found certain new isoforms of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts, such as a gene fusion between exon 18 of FGFR3 and exon 6 or exon 14 of TACC3 and agene fusion between exon 19 of FGFR3 and exon 11 of TACC3. In addition, we showed that the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion gene promotes cell proliferation, colony formation, and transforming ability in vitro, whereas the FGFR3-TACC3 K508M mutant or treatment with the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 abrogates these effects, suggesting that FGFR3-TACC3 most likely exerts its effects through activation of FGFR kinase activity. This activation likely leads to the development of NPC. Additionally, FGFR3-TACC3 could trigger activation of the ERK and Akt signaling pathways, whereas FGFR3-TACC3 K508M mutant could not, suggesting that these 2 signaling pathways might be involved in the function of FGFR3-TACC3. Taken together, our data demonstrated the oncogenic role of FGFR3-TACC3 in vitro, indicating that FGFR3-TACC3 may be useful as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in cancers.",

    "title": "Cell biology of molybdenum.",
    "abstract": "The transition element molybdenum (Mo) is of essential importance for (nearly) all biological systems as it is required by enzymes catalyzing diverse key reactions in the global carbon, sulfur and nitrogen metabolism. The metal itself is biologically inactive unless it is complexed by a special cofactor. With the exception of bacterial nitrogenase, where Mo is a constituent of the FeMo-cofactor, Mo is bound to a pterin, thus forming the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) which is the active compound at the catalytic site of all other Mo-enzymes. In eukaryotes, the most prominent Mo-enzymes are (1) sulfite oxidase, which catalyzes the final step in the degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids and is involved in detoxifying excess sulfite, (2) xanthine dehydrogenase, which is involved in purine catabolism and reactive oxygen production, (3) aldehyde oxidase, which oxidizes a variety of aldehydes and is essential for the biosynthesis of the phytohormone abscisic acid, and in autotrophic organisms also (4) nitrate reductase, which catalyzes the key step in inorganic nitrogen assimilation. All Mo-enzymes, except plant sulfite oxidase, need at least one more redox active center, many of them involving iron in electron transfer. The biosynthesis of Moco involves the complex interaction of six proteins and is a process of four steps, which also includes iron as well as copper in an indispensable way. Moco as released after synthesis is likely to be distributed to the apoproteins of Mo-enzymes by putative Moco-carrier proteins. Xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase, but not sulfite oxidase and nitrate reductase, require the post-translational sulfuration of their Mo-site for becoming active. This final maturation step is catalyzed by a Moco-sulfurase enzyme, which mobilizes sulfur from l-cysteine in a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent manner as typical for cysteine desulfurases.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genistein increases CPT1A, a rate-limiting enzyme in the beta-oxidation pathway, enzyme activity by increasing CPT1A transcription in HepG2 cells and, consequently, suppresses high fat induced obesity in C57BL/6J mice. Genistein and daidzein are the most abundant isoflavones in soy. AIM OF STUDY: To investigate the effect of co-treatment of genistein and L-carnitine on CPT1A enzyme activity and to determine whether daidzein also increases CPT1A activity and to establish a cell line that can be used to screen chemicals to regulate CPT1A transcription. METHODS: The enzyme activities of CPT1A were determined after HepG2 cells were incubated with 10 microM genistein or 10 microM daidzein or 1 mM L-carnitine or in combination with 10 microM genistein and 1 mM L-carnitine or in combination with 10 microM daidzein and 1 mM L-carnitine. The mRNA expression levels of CPT1A were determined by real time PCR method after HepG2 cells were incubated with 10 microM genistein or 10 microM daidzein. A suggested CPT1A promoter region was cloned from human genomic DNA and the CPT1A promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct was made, and the promoter-reporter gene construct was transfected into human hepatoma cell line Huh7. RESULTS: The enzyme activity of CPT1A was at least 2.3- fold higher in L-carnitine and genistein co-treated HepG2 cells than either single-agent treated cells. Daidzein also significantly increased the mRNA expression of CPT1A as well as the enzyme activity of CPT1A. A stable Huh7 cell line, which was selected after Huh7 cells were transfected with CPT1A promoter luciferase reporter gene construct, was characterized by confirming that luciferase activity of the cell line can be regulated by genistein and daidzein as well as clofibrate, a well-known CPT1A mRNA up-regulating drug. CONCLUSIONS: Genistein and daidzein can up-regulate CPT1A enzyme activity through up-regulation of CPT1A transcription. Co-treatment of L-carnitine and genistein additively increases CPT1A enzyme activity in HepG2 cells. A stable Huh7 cell line transfected with the CPT1A promoter luciferase reporter gene was established and characterized.",

    "abstract": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is an important approach in managing high blood pressure, and has increasingly been shown to affect cardiovascular disease processes mediated by angiotensin II throughout the cardiovascular and renal continua. Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) displaying unique pharmacologic properties, including a longer half life than any other ARB, that result in large and sustained reductions of blood pressure. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, telmisartan has proved superior to other antihypertensive agents (valsartan, losartan, ramipril, perindopril, and atenolol) in controlling blood pressure particularly towards the end of the dosing interval. There is also clinical evidence that telmisartan reduces left ventricular hypertrophy, reduces arterial stiffness and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, and confers renoprotection. The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) study has demonstrated that telmisartan has similar cardiovascular protective effects to ramipril in a large, high-risk patient population but was better tolerated. The powerful and sustained blood pressure control apparent in clinical trials, together with cardiovascular protection and tolerability demonstrated in ONTARGET means that telmisartan may be a preferred option for patients with hypertension.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many asthmatic patients exhibit sputum eosinophilia associated with exacerbations. Benralizumab targets eosinophils by binding IL-5 receptor alpha, inducing apoptosis through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the safety of benralizumab in adults with eosinophilic asthma and its effects on eosinophil counts in airway mucosal/submucosal biopsy specimens, sputum, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I study, 13 subjects were randomized to single-dose intravenous placebo or 1 mg/kg benralizumab (day 0; cohort 1), and 14 subjects were randomized to 3 monthly subcutaneous doses of placebo or 100 or 200 mg of benralizumab (days 0, 28, and 56; cohort 2). Cohorts 1 and 2 were consecutive. RESULTS: The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups. No serious adverse events related to benralizumab occurred. In cohort 1 intravenous benralizumab produced a median decrease from baseline of 61.9% in airway mucosal eosinophil counts (day 28; placebo: +19.6%; P = .28), as well as an 18.7% decrease (day 21) in sputum and a 100% decrease (day 28) in blood counts. Eosinophils were not detectable in bone marrow of benralizumab-treated subjects (day 28, n = 4). In cohort 2 subcutaneous benralizumab demonstrated a combined (100 + 200 mg) median reduction of 95.8% in airway eosinophil counts (day 84; placebo, 46.7%; P = .06), as well as an 89.9% decrease (day 28) in sputum and a 100% decrease (day 84) in blood counts. CONCLUSION: Single-dose intravenous and multiple-dose subcutaneous benralizumab reduced eosinophil counts in airway mucosa/submucosa and sputum and suppressed eosinophil counts in bone marrow and peripheral blood. The safety profile supports further development. Additional studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit in asthmatic patients.",

However, the strains used as prototypes in the design of the novel drugs belong to a specific clade (i.e. HIV-1 group M subtype B), which is the most prevalent in developed countries. At the same time, there is an increasing concern about the expansion of other HIV-1 clades as well as other related retroviruses, such as HIV-2. The HIV-2 PR is weakly inhibited by some PR inhibitors (e.g. amprenavir), and little is known of the mutational pathways leading to drug resistance in this virus. The design of specific PR inhibitors targeting HIV-2, or potent drugs showing broad specificity on HIV-1 and HIV-2 clades, remains a major challenge for the future.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oxytocin (OT) plays a major role in the control of male sexual responses. Notably, blockade of OT receptors has been reported to inhibit ejaculation in animals. The study aimed to investigate the action of a highly selective, non-peptide OT antagonist GSK557296 in a model of pharmacologically induced ejaculation in anaesthetized rats. The site of action was assessed by investigating different delivery routes for this compound. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Urethane-anaesthetized Wistar rats were implanted with a cerebral ventricle cannula for i.c.v. injections or with a subdural catheter for intrathecal (i.t.) GSK557296 injections. Occurrence of ejaculation was assessed following i.v. 7-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (7-OH-DPAT), a dopamine D3 receptor agonist. In addition, seminal vesicle pressures (SVP) and bulbospongiosus muscle (BS) EMG were recorded as physiological markers of emission and expulsion phases of ejaculation respectively. KEY RESULTS: Highest i.v. GSK557296 dose reduced occurrence of ejaculation and increases in SVP but had no effect on BS-EMG. I.c.v. GSK557296 dose dependently inhibited ejaculation, increases in SVP and BS contractions. At spinal thoracic level, GSK557296 dose dependently inhibited ejaculation and increases in SVP but BS-EMG was impaired only with the highest dose. When delivered at lumbar level, GSK557296 dose dependently inhibited ejaculation, increases in SVP and BS contractions. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In the 7-OH-DPAT-induced ejaculation model, GSK557296 acts peripherally and centrally to inhibit ejaculation with different modalities. Blockade of brain OT receptors seems to be the most effective mechanism of action. Targeting central OT receptors with highly selective antagonist seems a promising approach for the treatment of premature ejaculation.",

    "abstract": "Inhaled beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists are by far the most effective and safe bronchodilators currently available. They have not been surpassed by any other bronchodilating principle. The way to this position has been long and started with the first successful treatment of acute, severe asthma with s.c. injections of adrenaline 100 years ago. Over the years, synthetic congeners of adrenaline have been produced and tested for their pharmacological properties. During the first decades, little attention was given airway smooth muscle. The discovery of isoprenaline in 1940 was the first major step towards selective bronchodilation. This compound became a key tool for the classification of adrenoceptors into alpha and beta. Salbutamol and terbutaline were the first to show a significant attenuation of the cardiostimulant effect and confirmed the subdivision of beta-adrenoceptors into beta(1) and beta(2). Much effort was made to eliminate the next dose-limiting side effect, skeletal muscle tremor but in vain. Prolonged duration of action was achieved in three ways: with bambuterol, an orally active carbamate ester prodrug of terbutaline, salmeterol, an inhaled beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist emerging from a purposeful research project, and formoterol which was found, accidentally, to have a long duration of action when inhaled. Throughout the 20th century, beta-adrenoceptor agonists have been developed and marketed as racemates. The pharmacological activity usually resides in the (R)-enantiomer. Despite claims for the opposite, there is so far no compelling evidence that the presence of the less active (S)-enantiomer is of any harm to the patient. One hundred years of experience of structural modifications of adrenaline has shown that the possibilities to modify the properties of this endogenous prototype appear to be unlimited.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of the direct effects of fentanyl on human veins in vitro. DESIGN: In vitro, prospective with repeated measures. SETTING: University research laboratory. INTERVENTIONS: Dose-response curves were obtained for cumulative doses of fentanyl (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/L) on saphenous vein strips precontracted with (10(-6) mol/L) 5-hydroxytryptamine incubated with either naloxone (10(-4) mol/L), Nomega-nitroL-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) (10(-4) mol/L), indomethacin (10(-5) mol/L), glibenclamide (10(-4) mol/L), tetraethylammonium (10(-4) mol/L), or ouabain (10(-5) mol/L). Vein strips were also exposed to a Ca++-free solution and 0.1 mmol/L of ethylene glycol-bis-(b-aminoethylether) N,N'-tetraacetic acid; 5-hydroxytryptamine (10(-6) mol/L) was added to the bath before cumulative Ca++ (10(-4)-10(-2) mol/L). The same procedure was repeated in the presence of fentanyl (10(-6) , 3 x 10(-6) , or 10(-5) mol/L) (p &lt; 0.05 = significant). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Preincubation of vein strips with naloxone, L-NAME, or indomethacin did not influence the relaxant responses to fentanyl (p &gt; 0.05). Tetraethylammonium, glibenclamide, and ouabain reduced the relaxation response to fentanyl (p &lt; 0.05). A stepwise increase in tension was recorded with cumulative doses of Ca++ (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that fentanyl causes vasodilatation via both endothelium- and opioid receptor-independent mechanisms in the human saphenous vein. The relaxant effects of fentanyl are probably via activation of K+ channel and Na+K+-adenosine trisphosphatase and inhibition of Ca++ channel.",

Here we show that LGX818 potently decreased ERK phosphorylation and inhibited proliferation in BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines. Moreover, LGX818 downregulated CyclinD1 in a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-independent manner and induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, Surprisingly, LGX818 triggered cellular senescence in BRAFV600E melanoma cells, as evidenced by increased beta-galactosidase staining, while no appreciable induction of apoptosis was detected, as determined by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining and immunoblot analysis of caspase-3 processing and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Increased p27KIP1 expression and retinoblastoma protein activation were detected during LGX818-induced senescence. Additionally, inhibition of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1B by AZ191 reversed LGX818-induced CyclinD1 turnover and senescence. Interestingly, autophagy is triggered through inhibition of the mTOR/70S6K pathway during LGX818-induced senescence. Moreover, autophagy inhibition by pharmacological and genetic regulation attenuates LGX818-induced senescence. Notably, combining LGX818 with autophagy modulators has anti-proliferative effect in LGX818-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma cells. Altogether, we uncovered a mechanism by which LGX818 exerts its anti-tumor activity in BRAFV600E melanoma cells.",

    "abstract": "Micromolar quantities of aluminum have been found (Dill et al. (1987) J. Membrane Biol. 99, 187-196) to reduce the voltage dependence of the mitochondrial outer membrane channel, VDAC, from Neurospora crassa. In the present study, various metallic and organic ions were tested for possible aluminum-like effect, and only the trivalent metals exhibited a similar ability to reduce the channels voltage dependence. However, trivalency alone was not sufficient because lanthanum (III) had no effect. Quantitative analyses with three group IIIA metals (A1, Ga, and In) showed that, of the structural characteristics examined, the ability to form sufficient M(OH)3 at experimental pH was the primary property shared by all the effective metals. While providing new insight into the nature of VDAC's sensor, these results also indicate that aluminum-cell interaction may result from the presence of AI(OH)3 in solution in addition to the widely accepted AI3+-mediated interactions. While the [AI3+] is vanishingly low at neutral pH, the trihydroxide is the major form and should be considered as an important candidate for aluminum-induced cellular effects.",

We cloned and characterized porcine TLR7 and TLR8 genes from pig lymph node tissue. Sequence analysis showed that the aa sequence identities of porcine TLR7 with human, mouse and bovine TLR7 are 85, 78 and 90%, respectively, whereas porcine TLR8 aa sequence identities with human, mouse and bovine TLR8 are 73, 69 and 79%, respectively. Both porcine TLR7 and TLR8 proteins were expressed in cell lines and were N-glycosylated. The stimulatory activity of TLR7 and TLR8 ligands to porcine and human TLR7 and TLR8 in transiently transfected Cos-7 and 293T cells were analyzed using a NF-kappaB reporter assay. Two imidazoquinoline molecules, imiquimod and gardiquimod, markedly activated both porcine TLR7 and TLR8 whereas only human TLR7, but not TLR8, was activated by the ligands. Therefore, receptor specificity for porcine TLR8 is clearly species specific. We further showed that porcine TLR7 and TLR8 are located intracellularly and are mainly within the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, activation of transfected cells and porcine PBMC by TLR7 ligands was inhibited by bafilomycin A(1) indicating the requirement of endosomal/lysosomal acidification for activation of the receptors.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) experience disease progression despite receiving standard care therapy. Oxidative stress is associated with DKD severity and risk of progression, but currently approved therapies do not directly attenuate the pathologic consequences of oxidative stress. GS-4997 is a once daily, oral molecule that inhibits Apoptosis Signal-regulating Kinase 1 (ASK1), which is a key mediator of the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. METHODS: We describe the rationale and design of a Phase 2 placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the effects of GS-4997 in patients with T2DM and stage 3/4 DKD receiving standard of care therapy. Approximately, 300 subjects will be randomized in a stratified manner, based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin to creatinine ratio, to one of four arms in this dose-ranging study. The primary endpoint is change in eGFR at 48 weeks, and the key secondary endpoint is change in albuminuria. CONCLUSION: Guided by the biology of oxidative stress signaling through ASK1, the biology of DKD pathogenesis, and solid statistical methods, the decisions made for this Phase 2 study regarding delineating study population, efficacy outcomes, treatment period and statistical methods represent innovative attempts to resolve challenges specific to DKD study design.",

    "abstract": "DNA undergoes condensation, conformational transitions, aggregation and resolubilization in the presence of polyamines, positively charged organic molecules present in all cells. Under carefully controlled environmental conditions, DNA can also transform to a liquid crystalline state in vitro. We undertook the present work to examine the ability of spermidine, N4-methylspermidine, spermine, N1-acetylspermine and a group of tetramine, pentamine and hexamine analogs of spermine to induce and stabilize liquid crystalline DNA. Liquid crystalline textures were identified under a polarizing microscope. In the absence of polyamines, calf thymus DNA assumed a diffused, planar cholesteric phase with entrapped bubbles when incubated on a glass slide at 37 degrees C. In the presence of spermidine and spermine, the characteristic fingerprint textures of the cholesteric phase, adopting a hexagonal order, were obtained. The helical pitch was 2.5 micro m. The final structures were dendrimeric and crystalline when DNA was treated with spermine homologs and bis(ethyl) derivatives. A cholesteric structure was observed when DNA was treated with a hexamine at 37 degrees C. This structure changed to a hexagonal dendrimer with fluidity on prolonged incubation. These data show a structural specificity effect of polyamines on liquid crystalline phase transitions of DNA and suggest a possible physiological function of natural polyamines.",

    "abstract": "We have isolated a multiple-aminoglycoside-resistant Escherichia coli strain, strain ARS3, and have been the first to identify a novel plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methyltransferase, NpmA. This new enzyme shared a relatively low level of identity (30%) to the chromosomally encoded 16S rRNA methyltransferase (KamA) of Streptomyces tenjimariensis, an actinomycete aminoglycoside producer. The introduction of a recombinant plasmid carrying npmA could confer on E. coli consistent resistance to both 4,6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamines, such as amikacin and gentamicin, and 4,5-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamines, including neomycin and ribostamycin. The histidine-tagged NpmA elucidated methyltransferase activity against 30S ribosomal subunits but not against 50S subunits and the naked 16S rRNA molecule in vitro. We further confirmed that NpmA is an adenine N-1 methyltransferase specific for the A1408 position at the A site of 16S rRNA. Drug footprinting data indicated that binding of aminoglycosides to the target site was apparently interrupted by methylation at the A1408 position. These observations demonstrate that NpmA is a novel plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methyltransferase that provides a panaminoglycoside-resistant nature through interference with the binding of aminoglycosides toward the A site of 16S rRNA through N-1 methylation at position A1408.",

    "abstract": "The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) controls uptake and release of Ca2+ in muscle. Little information is available regarding the effect of volatile anesthetics on Ca2+ release from SR isolated from normal skeletal muscle, even though an abnormality of Ca2+ handling is implicated in malignant hyperthermia. In this study we used a Ca2+ electrode to monitor continuously the release of Ca2+ from SR and the effect of volatile anesthetics on this process. We found that halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane at 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 vol%, respectively, each increased the velocity of Ca2+ leakage by at least 150% when compared to control. Ruthenium red, a blocker of the SR Ca(2+)-release channel, was shown to have no effect on the velocity of Ca2+ leakage. Halothane and isoflurane both shortened the time at which Ca2+ leakage began (T) in a dose-dependent fashion. Halothane at 4.8 vol% decreased T from 293 +/- 21 s to 149 +/- 20 s. Isoflurane (4.8 vol%) decreased T to 203 +/- 16 s, and enflurane at 5 vol% had little effect, decreasing T to 259 +/- 19 s. We noted a marked stimulation in the ATPase activity of the SR by all three volatile anesthetics. Halothane at 0.63 vol%, isoflurane at 0.42 vol%, and enflurane at 0.62 vol% each increased ATPase activity by at least 300%. We conclude that the stimulation of the velocity of Ca2+ leakage by the volatile anesthetics is related to the more rapid depletion of ATP, but that the shortening of the onset of Ca2+ leakage is a independent phenomenon with a markedly different dose dependence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The combined effects of physostigmine and procyclidine (antagonizing muscarinic, nicotinic, and NMDA receptors) were tested against various doses of soman. Physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) in combination with procyclidine doses of 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg effectively prevented the development of convulsions and hippocampally monitored seizures when the doses of soman were 1.3, 1.6, or 2 x LD50, respectively. Results from [(3)H]MK-801-binding experiments showed that procyclidine inhibits the phencyclidine site at the NMDA receptor in a concentration-dependent manner. Physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) and procyclidine in a dose of 1 mg/kg did not prevent convulsions or seizures when the soman dose was 1.6 x LD50. Subsequent treatment with scopolamine in doses of 0.5 or 1 mg/kg immediately after (3 min) seizure onset showed that only the highest dose produced a reliable termination. When scopolamine (1 mg/kg) was given later (10 min) after onset of seizures, no effect was obtained. The sustained seizures were subsequently treated with diazepam (10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) and finally terminated 25 min after onset. In rats given inadequate prophylaxis, both modified convulsions and seizures were seen. It is suggested that moderate doses of prophylactics should be preferred to avoid adverse effects on cognitive functions because insufficient prophylaxis can be compensated for by adjunct treatment.",

    "title": "Amitriptyline is a potent blocker of human Kv1.1 and Kv7.2/7.3 channels.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kv1.1 and Kv7.2/7.3 channels control excitability of neuronal cells. As hyperexcitability is a sign of neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders, these channels may be important molecular targets of amitriptyline that cause pharmacological as well as toxicological effects by altering neuronal excitability. Since the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects of amitriptyline have not been fully elucidated, we aimed to characterize the interaction of amitriptyline with human Kv1.1 and Kv7.2/7.3 channels. We also intended to establish the interaction of amitriptyline with the Kv7.2/7.3 channel opener, retigabine. METHODS: Kv1.1 and Kv7.2/7.3 channels were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells and in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The effects of amitriptyline and retigabine were studied with the patch-clamp technique. RESULTS: Amitriptyline inhibited Kv1.1 and Kv7.2/7.3 channels in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner. The IC50-value was 22 +/- 3 microM (n = 33) and 10 +/- 1 microM (n = 40), respectively. Deactivating inward currents of Kv7.2/7.3 channels were inhibited with an IC50-value of 4.2 +/- 0.6 microM (n = 32). Inhibition of Kv7.2/7.3 channels by amitriptyline reversibly depolarized the resting membrane potential. Retigabine reversed both the inhibitory action of amitriptyline on Kv7.2/7.3 channels as well as the depolarization of the membrane potential. CONCLUSIONS: Since amitriptyline inhibited Kv1.1 and Kv7.2/7.3 channels only at toxicologically relevant plasma concentrations, our results suggest a role for these channels in the neuroexcitatory side effects of amitriptyline. As the inhibitory effects of amitriptyline were reversed by retigabine, a combination of amitriptyline and retigabine could be of additional benefit in the therapy of neuropathic pain.",

    "abstract": "The hyperalgesic response to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is thought to be mediated by activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway in primary sensory neurones. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative contribution of different PGE2 (EP) receptor subtypes to the overall activity of adenylyl cyclase in adult rat isolated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells, in vitro. PGE2 and the prostanoid EP4 receptor agonist ONO-AE1-329 increased [3H]cAMP production with EC50 values of 500 nM and 70 nM, respectively, and showed similar efficacies. No combination of prostanoid EP1, EP2, EP3 or EP4 receptor selective agonists produced synergistic increases in [3H]cAMP. The prostacyclin mimetic cicaprost increased [3H]cAMP production with an EC50 value of 42 nM and produced a significantly greater maximal response compared with PGE2. No evidence for prostanoid EP3 receptor-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity could be obtained to account for the relatively weak effect of PGE2 compared with prostacyclin receptor agonists. Interestingly, sulprostone (prostanoid EP3/EP1 receptor agonist) caused a Rho-kinase-dependent retraction of neurites, suggesting an alternative role for prostanoid EP3 receptors in DRG cells. In conclusion, PGE2 mediated increases in adenylyl cyclase activity in primary sensory neurones is likely to be mediated by activation of prostanoid EP4 receptors, and is not under inhibitory control by prostanoid EP3 receptors.",

This hit rate is about one to two orders of magnitude higher than those reported for medium- and high-throughput screening techniques in vitro.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The study of PPAR-alpha activation on apoA-I production in humans has been limited to fibrates, relatively weak PPAR-alpha agonists that may have other molecular effects. We sought to determine the effect of a potent and highly specific PPAR-alpha agonist, LY518674, on apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoB-100 kinetics in humans with metabolic syndrome and low levels of HDL cholesterol (C). METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects were randomized to receive LY518674 (100 microg) once daily (n=13) or placebo (n=15) for 8 weeks. Subjects underwent a kinetic study using a deuterated leucine tracer to measure apolipoprotein production and fractional catabolic rates (FCR) at baseline and after treatment. LY518674 significantly reduced VLDL-C (-38%, P=0.002) and triglyceride (-23%, P=0.002) levels whereas LDL-C and HDL-C levels were unchanged. LY518674 significantly reduced VLDL apoB-100 (-12%, P=0.01) levels, attributable to an increased VLDL apoB-100 FCR with no change in VLDL apoB-100 production. IDL and LDL apoB-100 kinetics were unchanged. LY518674 significantly increased the apoA-I production rate by 31% (P&lt;0.0001), but this was accompanied by a 33% increase in the apoA-I FCR (P=0.002), resulting in no change in plasma apoA-I. There was a 71% increase in the apoA-II production rate (P&lt;0.0001) accompanied by a 25% increase in the FCR (P&lt;0.0001), resulting in a significant increase in plasma apoA-II. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of PPAR-alpha with LY518674 (100 microg) in subjects with metabolic syndrome and low HDL-C increased the VLDL apoB-100 FCR consistent with enhanced lipolysis of plasma triglyceride. Significant increases in the apoA-I and apoA-II production rates were accompanied by increased FCRs resulting in no change in HDL-C levels. These data indicate a major effect of LY518674 on the production and clearance of apoA-I and HDL despite no change in the plasma concentration. The effect of these changes on reverse cholesterol transport remains to be determined.",

    "abstract": "The kringle modules of apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] are highly homologous with kringle 4 of plasminogen (75-94%) and like the latter are autonomous structural and functional units. Apo(a) contains 14-37 kringle 4 (KIV) repeats distributed into 10 classes (1-10). Lp(a) binds lysine-Sepharose via a lysine binding site (LBS) located in KIV-10 (88% homology with plasminogen K4). However, the W72R substitution that occurs in rhesus monkeys and occasionally in humans leads to impaired lysine binding capacity of KIV-10 and Lp(a). The foregoing has been investigated by determining the structures of KIV-10/M66 (M66 variant) in its unliganded and ligand [epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA)] bound modes and the structure of recombinant KIV-10/M66R72 (the W72R mutant). In addition, the EACA liganded structure of a sequence polymorph (M66T in about 42-50% of the human population) was reexamined (KIV-10/T66/EACA). The KIV-10/M66, KIV-10/M66/EACA, and KIV-10/T66/EACA molecular structures are highly isostructural, indicating that the LBS of the kringles is preformed anticipating ligand binding. A displacement of three water molecules from the EACA binding groove and a movement of R35 bringing the guanidinium group close to the carboxylate of EACA to assist R71 in stabilizing the anionic group of the ligand are the only changes accompanying ligand binding. Both EACA structures were in the embedded binding mode utilizing all three binding centers (anionic, hydrophobic, cationic) like plasminogen kringles 1 and 4. The KIV-10/T66/EACA structure determined in this work differs from one previously reported [Mikol, V., Lo Grasso, P. V. and, Boettcher, B. R. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 256, 751-761], which crystallized in a different crystal system and displayed an unbound binding mode, where only the amino group of EACA interacted with the anionic center of the LBS. The remainder of the ligand extended into solvent perpendicular to the kringle surface, leaving the hydrophobic pocket and the cationic center of the LBS unoccupied. The structure of recombinant KIV-10/M66R72 shows that R72 extends along the ligand binding groove parallel to the expected position of EACA toward the anionic center (D55/D57) and makes a salt bridge with D57. Thus, the R72 side chain mimics ligand binding, and loss of binding ability is the result of steric blockage of the LBS by R72 physically occupying part of the site. The rhesus monkey lysine binding impairment is compared with that of chimpanzee where KIV-10 has been shown to have a D57N mutation instead.",

    "title": "[Trazodon--the antidepressant: mechanism of action and its position in the treatment of depression].",
    "abstract": "The pharmacological properties and possible clinical use of trazodon in the treatment of depression are presented. Trazodon is the only antidepressant from the SARI (Serotonin Antagonists and Reuptake Inhibitors) group available in Poland. It has a wide pharmacodynamic profile (being an antagonist of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C serotoninergic receptors, alpha1 and alpha2 adrenergic receptors as well as H1 histaminergic receptors, and in higher doses it blocks the SERT serotonine transporter) which explains its wide therapeutic spectrum ranging from symptomatic treatment, through the potentialization of other drugs activity, all the way to monotherapy of depressive syndromes. An especially complex action on the serotoninergic system results in the lack of unwanted side-effects during treatment with trazodon (e.g. sexual dysfunction, significant body weight gain), which may be present during the treatment with other drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). It is metabolised by the CYP450 isoenzyme: mainly the 2D6 and 3A4. This requires its dose to be adjusted when administered simultaneously with other drugs influencing the activity of those isoenzymes. Trazodon CR is an orally administered controlled release form, which simplifies its dosage and reduces the risk of adverse effects. Usually doses of 75 to 600mg daily are used; in the elderly those doses should be lower. Trazodon turned out to be effective in the treatment of various depressive syndromes, amongst them depression with insomnia, with anxiety and unrest, as well as depression in the elderly. In the recommended dose spectrum, trazodon is well tolerated. Unwanted adverse effects of the drug appear rarely and they are: somnolence, dizziness, gastrointestinal dysfunctions, and dry mouth.",

    "title": "Inhibition of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase activity by volatile anesthetics.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The precise sites and mechanisms of action of volatile anesthetics remain unknown. Recently, several integral membrane proteins have been suggested as potential targets to which anesthetics can bind at hydrophobic regions. Impairment of cell Ca2+ homeostasis has been postulated as one of the possible mechanisms of anesthetic action. To test these hypotheses, the authors selected the human erythrocyte Ca(2+)-ATPase as a model membrane protein. This enzyme is an integral membrane protein that is instrumental in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in the cell in which it is the sole Ca(2+)-transporting system. Thus, any functional alteration of the Ca(2+)-ATPase by anesthetics may lead to serious perturbations in Ca(2+)-regulated processes in the cell. METHODS: The Ca(2+)-ATPase activity was measured as a function of increased concentration of four volatile anesthetics: halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, and desflurane. RESULTS: All four anesthetics significantly inhibited the Ca(2+)-ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The half-maximal inhibition occurred at anesthetic concentrations from 0.3 to 0.7 vol% at 37 degrees C, which, except for desflurane, is a clinically relevant concentration range. The greater the clinical potency of the volatile anesthetics studied, the less was the concentration required to inhibit the Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. The inhibition was less at 25 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, which is consistent with direct interactions of the nonpolar interfaces of the enzyme with the nonpolar of the portions of the anesthetics. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings indicate that the Ca(2+)-ATPase is a suitable model for investigating the mechanism of action of volatile anesthetics on the integral membrane protein, and that this inhibition may be specific.",

    "title": "Selective positive modulation of the SK3 and SK2 subtypes of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Positive modulators of small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (SK1, SK2, and SK3) exert hyperpolarizing effects that influence the activity of excitable and non-excitable cells. The prototype compound 1-EBIO or the more potent compound NS309, do not distinguish between the SK subtypes and they also activate the related intermediate conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (IK). This paper demonstrates, for the first time, subtype-selective positive modulation of SK channels. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Using patch clamp and fluorescence techniques we studied the effect of the compound cyclohexyl-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-pyrazol-1-yl)-6-methyl-pyrimidin-4-yl]-amine (CyPPA) on recombinant hSK1-3 and hIK channels expressed in HEK293 cells. CyPPA was also tested on SK3 and IK channels endogenously expressed in TE671 and HeLa cells. KEY RESULTS: CyPPA was found to be a positive modulator of hSK3 (EC(50) = 5.6 +/- 1.6 microM, efficacy 90 +/- 1.8 %) and hSK2 (EC(50) = 14 +/- 4 microM, efficacy 71 +/- 1.8 %) when measured in inside-out patch clamp experiments. CyPPA was inactive on both hSK1 and hIK channels. At hSK3 channels, CyPPA induced a concentration-dependent increase in the apparent Ca(2+)-sensitivity of channel activation, changing the EC(50)(Ca(2+)) from 429 nM to 59 nM. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: As a pharmacological tool, CyPPA may be used in parallel with the IK/SK openers 1-EBIO and NS309 to distinguish SK3/SK2- from SK1/IK-mediated pharmacological responses. This is important for the SK2 and SK1 subtypes, since they have overlapping expression patterns in the neocortical and hippocampal regions, and for SK3 and IK channels, since they co-express in certain peripheral tissues.",

    "title": "The thrombospondin-1 mimetic ABT-510 increases the uptake and effectiveness of cisplatin and paclitaxel in a mouse model of epithelial ovarian cancer.",
    "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) comprises approximately 90% of ovarian cancers and arises from the surface epithelium. Typical treatment of EOC involves cytoreductive surgery combined with chemotherapy. More recent therapies have targeted the tumor vasculature using antiangiogenic compounds such as thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). TSP-1 mimetic peptides such as ABT-510 have been created and have been in various clinical trials. We have previously shown that ABT-510 reduces abnormal vasculature associated with tumor tissue and increases the presence of mature blood vessels. It has been hypothesized that treatment with antiangiogenic compounds would allow increased delivery of cytotoxic agents and enhance treatment. In this study, we evaluated the potential role of ABT-510 and various chemotherapeutics (cisplatin and paclitaxel) on tumor progression, angiogenesis, and the benefits of combinational treatments on tissue uptake and perfusion using an orthotopic syngeneic mouse model of EOC. Animals were treated with ABT-510 (100 mg/kg per day) alone or in combination with cisplatin (2 mg/kg per 3 days) or paclitaxel (10 mg/kg per 2 days) at 60 days after tumor induction. Radiolabeled and fluorescently labeled paclitaxel demonstrated a significant increase in tumor uptake after ABT-510 treatment. Combined treatment with ABT-510 and cisplatin or paclitaxel resulted in a significant increase in tumor cell and tumor endothelial cell apoptosis and a resultant decrease in ovarian tumor size. Combined treatment also regressed secondary lesions and eliminated the presence of abdominal ascites. The results from this study show that through vessel normalization, ABT-510 increases uptake of chemotherapy drugs and can induce regression of advanced ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway may have a pathogenic role in colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent studies suggest that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) reduces the risk of inflammatory bowel disease-related CRC, but the mechanism by which 5-ASA interferes with CRC cell growth remains unknown. In this study, we have examined whether the negative effect of 5-ASA on CRC cells is dependent on COX-2/PGE2 axis inhibition. We show that 5-ASA down-regulates both constitutive and TNF-alpha or IL-1beta-induced COX-2 in HT-115 and HT-29 cells. Inhibition of COX-2 by 5-ASA occurs at the RNA and protein level, and is associated with a significant decrease in PGE2 synthesis, arrest of growth and enhanced death of CRC cells. However, exogenous PGE2 does not revert the 5-ASA-mediated CRC cell proliferation block. 5-ASA also inhibits the growth of DLD-1, a COX-deficient CRC cell line, thus suggesting that the anti-proliferative effect of 5-ASA on CRC cells is not strictly dependent on the inhibition of COX-2/PGE2. Taken together our data indicate that 5-ASA causes both a COX-2-dependent and -independent inhibition of CRC cell growth.",

    "abstract": "Patients with the cblC vitamin B(12) (cobalamin, cbl) disorder are defective in the intracellular synthesis of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin and have combined homocystinuria and methylmalonic aciduria. While other vitamin B(12) disorders are treatable with high dose cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) or hydroxocobalamin (OHCbl), cblC patients respond well to OHCbl but not to CNCbl. Patient mutations were introduced into recombinant MMACHC (cblC) protein and the binding of CNCbl and OHCbl was examined. Three mutations were analyzed: G147D, associated with early onset, vitamin B(12) unresponsive disease; R161Q, associated with late onset disease that is highly responsive to OHCbl; and H122A, selected to test the hypothesis that H122 is central to a proposed vitamin B(12) binding motif on MMACHC. We report here that wild-type MMACHC binds both OHCbl and CNCbl with similar, tight affinity (K(d)=5.7 microM). We also report that MMACHC binds CNCbl in the base-off form, with the dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) base of cobalamin displaced from coordination with the cobalt. In this form, wild-type MMACHC is able to reductively decyanate CNCbl to cob(II)alamin requiring only the presence of NADPH and FAD. We demonstrate that MMACHC with the G147D mutation is unable to bind either CNCbl or OHCbl, providing a straight forward explanation for the absence of response to either vitamin form. However, we show that MMACHC containing the R161Q mutation binds OHCbl with wild-type affinity, but is disturbed in binding CNCbl and has impaired decyanation. Finally, we show that H122A has reduced binding, but like R161Q, it binds OHCbl more tightly than CNCbl, suggesting that this histidine is not absolutely required for binding. These studies suggest that the ability of mutant MMACHC to respond to vitamin therapy depends on its ability to bind the vitamin with significant affinity, and for CNCbl, also on its ability to bind in the base-off form to facilitate reductive decyanation. These studies emphasize the continued use of OHCbl with cblC patients for maximum therapeutic effect.",

To evaluate the potential of therapeutic agents as inhibitors of such transporters on bile canalicular membranes, we examined the inhibition of the primary active transport of typical substrates by 15 drugs, clinically known to cause cholestasis in canalicular membrane vesicles. The inhibition by most of the compounds in rat canalicular membrane vesicles (CMVs) was minimal or observed at much higher concentrations than obtained in clinical situations. However, cloxacillin, cyclosporin A and midecamycin inhibited BSEP, and cyclosporin A and midecamycin inhibited MRP2 with an inhibition constant close to the clinical concentration. By comparing the inhibition potential between rat and human CMVs, the inhibition of BSEP- and MRP2-mediated transport by midecamycin and cyclosporin A was relatively similar whereas the inhibitory effect on BSEP-mediated transport by cloxacillin and glibenclamide was more marked in humans than in rats. These results suggest that the majority of cholestasis-inducing drugs have a minimal inhibitory effect on rat BSEP and MRP2 although species differences in inhibitory potential should be considered, especially in the case of BSEP.",

To determine if these differences might be due to NMDA receptor composition, we compared the expression of NR1, NR2A, NR2B, NR2C and NR2D subunit mRNAs in immunocytochemically identified vasopressin and oxytocin neuroendocrine cells. In contrast to NR1 subunit mRNA which was equally expressed in both vasopressin and oxytocin cells, NR2B and NR2C displayed very different expression patterns. In oxytocin cells, the NR2B subunit comprised the majority (65%) of the total NR2 expression with NR2C and NR2D contributing 6% and 27%, respectively. Vasopressin cells exhibited 5-fold higher NR2C (32%), approximately half as much NR2B mRNA (39%) and equivalent NR2D (31%). In vitro expression studies have shown that the NR1-NR2C subunit combination exhibits weaker magnesium block and higher affinity for glycine than NR1-NR2B. Thus, the high expression of NR2C in vasopressin cells relative to oxytocin cells may make these cells more susceptible to glutamatergic activation. These observations in vasopressin and oxytocin cells provide the basis for a working model to investigate how differential NMDA receptor composition may shape the neurophysiological properties of neurons.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory reactions play an important role in ischemia/reperfusion injury in various organs. Since histamine is closely related to inflammatory reactions and immune responses, effects of postischemic administration of histaminergic ligands on ischemia-induced liver injury were examined in rats. Animals were subjected to warm ischemia for 30 min by occlusion of the left portal vein and hepatic artery under halothane anesthesia, and liver damage was evaluated by assessing plasma concentrations of transaminases after 24 h. Warm ischemia for 30 min provoked severe liver damage after 24 h, and the plasma concentrations of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were 8600 I.U./l and 13100 I.U./l, respectively. Subcutaneous injections of histamine twice, immediately and 6 h after reperfusion (20 mg/kg, each), alleviated liver damage. The plasma concentrations of ALT and AST in the histamine group were 35% and 24% of those in the control group, respectively. Neither mepyramine (3 mg/kg x 2), an H1 antagonist, nor cimetidine (15 mg/kg x 2), an H2 antagonist, affected the outcome in histamine-treated rats. However, thioperamide (5 mg/kg x 2), an H3/H4 antagonist, completely abolished the alleviation caused by histamine. Administration of dimaprit (1-10 mg/kg x 2), an H2/H4 agonist, mimicked the protective effect of histamine, and the effect of dimaprit is reversed by thioperamide, whereas neither H1 nor H2 antagonists altered the outcome caused by dimaprit. Clozapine (15 mg/kg x 2), an H4 agonist, also mimicked the protective effect of histamine. These findings indicate that stimulation of histamine H4 receptors after ischemic events prevents development of reperfusion injury in the liver.",

A novel in vitro tool that can be used as a fast, simple and cost effective alternative is cDNA phage display. This tool is used in our study to select cellular targets of 17beta estradiol (E2). It was possible to select two potential cellular targets of E2 out of the T7 Select  Human Breast cDNA phage library. The selected cellular targets, autophagy/beclin-1 regulator 1 (beclin 1) and ATP synthase F(0) subunit 6 (ATP6) have so far been unknown as binding proteins of E2. To confirm the E2 binding properties of these selected proteins, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used. With SPR the K(d) values were determined to be 0.178+-0.031 and 0.401+-0.142 nM for the ATP6 phage and beclin 1 phage, respectively. These K(d) values in the low nM range verify that the selected cellular proteins are indeed binding proteins for E2. The selection and identification of these two potential cellular targets of E2, can enhance our current understanding of its mechanism of action. This illustrates the potential of lytic (T7) cDNA phage display in toxicology, to provide important information about cellular targets of chemical compounds.",

Studies were conducted to characterize the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of this drug relevant to its topical ocular use. AL-4943A inhibits histamine release in a concentration-dependent fashion (IC50 = 559 microM) from human conjunctival mast cell preparations in vitro. Histamine release was not stimulated by AL-4943A at concentrations as high as 10 mM. In contrast, ketotifen stimulated histamine release at concentrations slightly higher than effective inhibitory concentrations. AL-4943A did not display any in vitro cyclooxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase inhibition. Topical ocular application of AL-4943A effectively inhibits antigen- and histamine-stimulated conjunctivitis in guinea pigs. Passive anaphylaxis in guinea pig conjunctiva was attenuated by AL-4943A applied 30 min prior to intravenous or topical ocular antigen challenge (ED50 values 0.0067% and 0.0170%, w/v, respectively). Antihistaminic activity in vivo was demonstrated using a model of histamine-induced vascular permeability in guinea pig conjunctiva. AL-4943A applied topically from 5 min to 24 hrs prior to histamine challenge effectively and concentration-dependently inhibited the vascular permeability response, indicating the compound has an acceptable onset and a long duration of action. Drug concentrations 5-fold greater than those effective against histamine-stimulated conjunctival responses failed to inhibit vascular permeability responses induced with either serotonin or Platelet-Activating-Factor. These data indicate that the anti-histaminic effect observed with AL-4943A is specific. These anti-allergic/antihistaminic activities of AL-4943A observed in preclinical model systems have been confirmed in clinical trials in allergic patients.",

Four radiolabeled antibody products are progressing towards commercialization for the RAIT of NHL: 131I-tositumomab (Bexxar), 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, 90Y-epratuzumab (hLL2), and 131I-Lym-1. All except epratuzumab are murine monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) labeled with an isotope, except that ibritumomab (Zevalin) adds chimeric rituximab to the product, whereas epratuzumab is solely a humanized Mab. Bexxar and Zevalin target CD20, epratuzumab binds to CD22, and Lym-1 reacts with HLA-DR. Clinical studies have shown that all four antibody products can be safe and efficacious. Bexxar has been shown to induce responses that are relatively better than the prior chemotherapy, and has also been shown to be effective in combination with chemotherapy as a frontline therapy of low-grade and transformed NHL. However, since it is a fully murine Mab, it did show a approximately 60% HAMA rate in untreated patients. Zevalin has been found to be more effective than rituximab, its naked chimeric Mab counterpart, as well as in chemotherapy-relapsed low-grade NHL patients. Both radiolabeled epratuzumab and Lym-1 have shown efficacy in patients who have failed chemotherapy, either with low-grade or aggressive forms of NHL. It appears that Bexxar and Zevalin will be the first two radiolabeled antibodies that may be available for widespread use in the U.S., and will mark the final introduction of RAIT as an approved cancer treatment modality. Future studies will help define the role of these RAIT products in the management of NHL, especially as part of a multimodal therapy of this disease.",

    "abstract": "A series of 32 heterocyclic analogues based on the structure of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty acid amide hydrolase activities. The designed compounds feature a hydrophobic moiety and different heterocyclic subunits that mimic the glycerol fragment. This series has allowed us to carry out the first systematic structure-activity relationship study on inhibition of 2-AG hydrolysis. The most promising compounds were oxiran-2-ylmethyl (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenoate (1) and tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-ylmethyl (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenoate (5). They inhibited cytosolic 2-oleoylglycerol (2-OG) hydrolysis completely (IC50 values of 4.5 and 5.6 muM, respectively). They also blocked, albeit less potently, 2-OG hydrolysis in membrane fractions (IC50 values of 19 and 26 muM, respectively) and anandamide hydrolysis (IC50 values of 12 and 51 muM, respectively). These compounds will be useful in delineating the importance of the cytosolic hydrolytic activity in the regulation of 2-AG levels and, hence, its potential as a target for drug development.",

    "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibition is a well-known anti-inflammatory mechanism, but the development of PDE4 inhibitors has been hampered by side effects such as nausea and emesis. Local delivery of a PDE4 inhibitor to the site of inflammation may overcome these issues. The purpose of this study was to assess the therapeutic potential of E6005 (methyl 4-[({3-[6,7-dimethoxy-2-(methylamino)quinazolin-4-yl]phenyl}amino)carbonyl]benzoate), a novel PDE4 inhibitor developed as a topical agent for atopic dermatitis (AD). E6005 potently and selectively inhibited human PDE4 activity with an IC50 of 2.8 nM and suppressed the production of various cytokines from human lymphocytes and monocytes with IC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.1 nM. In mice models, the topical application of E6005 produced an immediate antipruritic effect as well as an anti-inflammatory effect with reduced expression of cytokines/adhesion molecules. On the basis of these observed effects, topical E6005 ameliorated the appearance of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in two types of AD models, hapten- and mite-elicited models, exhibiting inhibitory effects comparable to that of tacrolimus. The use of 14C-labeled E6005 showed rapid clearance from the blood and low distribution to the brain, contributing to the low emetic potential of this compound. These results suggest that E6005 may be a promising novel therapeutic agent with antipruritic activity for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we examined the effects of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, B7.1, B7.2, CD40, and CD40 ligand (CD40L) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis as well as its effects on cytokine production using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Whereas no inhibitor of spontaneous expression of adhesion molecules was reported, we found that PGE1 inhibited spontaneous ICAM-1, B7.2, and CD40 expression on monocytes in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on the expression of B7.1 and CD40L. Although interleukin (IL)-18 induced the expression of ICAM-1, B7.2, CD40, and CD40L, PGE1 prevented IL-18-induced expression of ICAM-1, B7.2, and CD40. We examined the involvement of five subtypes of PGE1 receptors (IP, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) in the effect of PGE1 on the expression of these adhesion molecules using subtype-specific agonists. Among EP receptor agonists, EP2 and EP4 receptor agonists inhibited IL-18-elicited ICAM-1, B7.2, and CD40 expression. ONO-1301 (IP receptor agonist) prevented the expression of ICAM-1, B7.2, and CD40 regardless of the presence of IL-18 with the same potency as PGE1. The effect of a combination of ONO-1301 and 11-deoxy (D)-PGE1 (EP2/EP4 receptor agonist) on ICAM-1, B7.2, and CD40 expression mimicked that of PGE1. Moreover, PGE1 inhibited the production of IL-12 and interferon-gamma in PBMC in the presence and absence of IL-18, whereas PGE1 induced IL-10 production. In conclusion, IP receptor and EP2/EP4 receptor play an important role in the action of PGE1 on the expression of adhesion molecules on monocytes and cytokine production.",

    "title": "Discovery of a novel series of potent and selective substrate-based inhibitors of p60c-src protein tyrosine kinase: conformational and topographical constraints in peptide design.",
    "abstract": "On the basis of the efficient substrate for p60c-src protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) YIYGSFK-NH2 (1) (Km = 55 microM) obtained by combinatorial methods, we have designed and synthesized a series of conformationally and topographically constrained substrate-based peptide inhibitors of this enzyme, which showed IC50 values in the low-micromolar range (1-3 microM). A \"rotamer scan\" was performed by introducing the four stereoisomers of beta-Me(2')Nal in the postulated interaction site of the peptide inhibitor 23(IC50 = 1.6 microM). This substitution led to selective and potent inhibitors of p60c-src PTK; however, no substantial difference in potency was observed among them. This and the results of the \"stereochemical scan\" performed at residues 2 and 7 of 3 (peptides 19-21), which form the disulfide bond, may suggest that the enzyme active site does not have rigid topographic requirements and thus is able to achieve important conformational changes to bind the ligand as long as the pharmacophore pattern in the inhibitor is conserved. Two new potent iodo-containing nonphosphorylatable tyrosine analogues were also incorporated into our lead inhibitory sequence 23, producing the most potent inhibitors for p60c-src PTK identified thus far in our studies. Compounds 29 and 30 exhibit IC50 values of 0.13 and 0.54 microM, respectively. Peptide 29 is 420-fold more potent than the parent peptide 1. Selectivity studies of peptides 23-30 toward p60c-src, Lyn, and Lck PTK showed in general high Lyn/Src and moderate Lck/Src selectivity ratios. We found that the chi1 space constraints of the specialized amino acids, introduced at position 3 of the peptide lead 23, were not as important as the configuration of the Calpha of that residue to recognize the subtle chemical environment surrounding the active site of Src and Lck PTK, as reflected on the obtained Lck/Src selectivity ratios.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Here, we provide evidence that the Forkhead Box (Fox) m1b (Foxm1b or Foxm1) transcription factor is essential for the development of HCC. Conditionally deleted Foxm1b mouse hepatocytes fail to proliferate and are highly resistant to developing HCC in response to a Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/Phenobarbital (PB) liver tumor-induction protocol. The mechanism of resistance to HCC development is associated with nuclear accumulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) protein and reduced expression of the Cdk1-activator Cdc25B phosphatase. We showed that the Foxm1b transcription factor is a novel inhibitory target of the p19(ARF) tumor suppressor. Furthermore, we demonstrated that conditional overexpression of Foxm1b protein in osteosarcoma U2OS cells greatly enhances anchorage-independent growth of cell colonies on soft agar. A p19(ARF) 26-44 peptide containing nine D-Arg to enhance cellular uptake of the peptide was sufficient to significantly reduce both Foxm1b transcriptional activity and Foxm1b-induced growth of U2OS cell colonies on soft agar. These results suggest that this (D-Arg)(9)-p19(ARF) 26-44 peptide is a potential therapeutic inhibitor of Foxm1b function during cellular transformation. Our studies demonstrate that the Foxm1b transcription factor is required for proliferative expansion during tumor progression and constitutes a potential new target for therapy of human HCC tumors.",

Compared to fingolimod (ie, precursor of the S1P modulators commercially available for the treatment of relapsing-remitting [RR] multiple sclerosis [MS]), siponimod exhibits selective affinity for types 1 and 5 S1P receptor, leading to a lower risk of adverse events that are mainly induced by S1P3 receptor activation, such as bradycardia and vasoconstriction. In addition, S1P1 and S1P5 receptors are expressed by neurons and glia and could mediate a possible neuroprotective effect of the drug. A Phase II clinical trial of siponimod for RR MS showed a significant effect of the active drug compared to placebo on reducing gadolinium-enhancing lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 3 months of treatment. In a recently completed Phase III trial, treatment with siponimod was associated with a significant reduction in disability progression in secondary progressive (SP) MS patients compared to placebo.

This drug treatment has been shown to produce long-term priming of the D2 receptor. Beginning on P62, rats were administered the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (2.5 mg/kg) or saline twice daily (i.p.) for 28 days. One day after olanzapine treatment ceased, rats were tested on the place and match-to-place versions of the Morris water maze (MWM) for seven consecutive days. Dopamine D2 receptor priming was verified through a yawning behavioural test, a D2 receptor-mediated event, before olanzapine was administered as well as after olanzapine treatment and behavioural testing were complete. Results showed that neonatal quinpirole treatment induced D2 priming that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. On the MWM place version, D2-primed rats demonstrated a significant impairment that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment, but olanzapine treatment to animals neonatally treated with saline produced a significant deficit on the place version of the MWM. There were no significant deficits on the match-to-place version. Brain tissue analyses revealed that neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in hippocampal NGF, BDNF and ChAT that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. Neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in BDNF and ChAT in the frontal cortex that was unaffected by olanzapine treatment. These results show that olanzapine eliminates D2 receptor priming and cognitive impairment and also alleviates decreases in neurotrophins and acetylcholinergic markers produced by D2 priming in the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "The phosphodiesterase-11A (PDE11) family consists of four splice variants (PDE11A1-PDE11A4) that contain a conserved carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) catalytic domain that hydrolyzes cAMP and cGMP; the amino-termini (N-termini) vary in length and amino acid sequence. PDE11A2, PDE11A3, and PDE11A4 contain one or more GAF (cGMP-binding phosphodiesterase, Anabaena adenylyl cyclase, and Escherichia coli FhlA) subdomains. In the present study, PDE11A1 and PDE11A2 demonstrated higher affinity for cAMP and cGMP when directly compared to that of the longest isoform, PDE11A4. Moreover, PDE11A3, PDE11A2, and PDE11A1, which contain progressively shorter N-termini, were more sensitive than PDE11A4 to inhibition by two structurally unrelated inhibitors, tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra). The substrate and inhibitor affinity differences among the PDE11 isozymes could not be ascribed to differences in their quaternary structure since PDE11A4, PDE11A3, and PDE11A2 were determined to be dimers, and PDE11A1 was a tetramer. These data also demonstrate that PDE11 isozymes containing at least 123 C-terminal amino acids of the GAF-B domain are stable oligomers and that GAF-A is not required for oligomerization. The isolated PDE11 catalytic domain (Met-563-Asn-934) displayed both monomeric and dimeric forms, and upon dilution, this domain was primarily monomeric, indicating that the main oligomerization contacts are within the N-termini of PDE isozymes. This report is the first to describe an inhibitory effect of the N-terminal region of PDE11A4 on the affinity of the catalytic domain for both substrates and inhibitors and the first to define the quaternary structure and the regions that contribute to this structure within the human PDE11A family.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the alterations in cellular protein interactions and their relations to genetic mutations that cause renal cell carcinoma (RCC) provides a unique opportunity for the development of disease-specific therapy for patients with advanced forms of this disease. There is substantial evidence of an association between mutation on von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene and the earliest stages of tumorigenesis of RCC. The main consequence of VHL loss is the upregulation of downstream proangiogenic factors leading to highly vascular tumors. Overexpression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is also caused by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key component of signaling pathways inside the cell, involved in cell proliferation. The inhibition of proangiogenic factors and mTOR was the main idea behind the development of new targeted agents in advanced RCC. Since December 2005, 3 targeted agents have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced RCC: sorafenib, sunitinib and temsirolimus. Sorafenib and sunitinib are synthetic, orally active agents shown to directly inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptors -2 and -3 (VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-beta), while temsirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor. Recent clinical studies form the basis for new guidelines for the treatment of advanced RCC: sorafenib should be used as a second-line treatment, sunitinib as the first-line therapy for good and intermediate-risk patients, and temsirolimus should be considered as first-line treatment for poor-risk patients. Future approaches to targeted therapy should focus on optimizing the use of current active drugs, exploring their combinations or investigating their sequential use. In addition, it is important to define the mechanisms of resistance on their use and to further investigate biomarkers and enhance treatment efficacy for the individual patients.

    "title": "Structure/function characterization of micro-conotoxin KIIIA, an analgesic, nearly irreversible blocker of mammalian neuronal sodium channels.",
    "abstract": "Peptide neurotoxins from cone snails continue to supply compounds with therapeutic potential. Although several analgesic conotoxins have already reached human clinical trials, a continuing need exists for the discovery and development of novel non-opioid analgesics, such as subtype-selective sodium channel blockers. Micro-conotoxin KIIIA is representative of micro-conopeptides previously characterized as inhibitors of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant sodium channels in amphibian dorsal root ganglion neurons. Here, we show that KIIIA has potent analgesic activity in the mouse pain model. Surprisingly, KIIIA was found to block most (&gt;80%) of the TTX-sensitive, but only approximately 20% of the TTX-resistant, sodium current in mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. KIIIA was tested on cloned mammalian channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Both Na(V)1.2 and Na(V)1.6 were strongly blocked; within experimental wash times of 40-60 min, block was reversed very little for Na(V)1.2 and only partially for Na(V)1.6. Other isoforms were blocked reversibly: Na(V)1.3 (IC50 8 microM), Na(V)1.5 (IC50 284 microM), and Na(V)1.4 (IC50 80 nM). \"Alanine-walk\" and related analogs were synthesized and tested against both Na(V)1.2 and Na(V)1.4; replacement of Trp-8 resulted in reversible block of Na(V)1.2, whereas replacement of Lys-7, Trp-8, or Asp-11 yielded a more profound effect on the block of Na(V)1.4 than of Na(V)1.2. Taken together, these data suggest that KIIIA is an effective tool to study structure and function of Na(V)1.2 and that further engineering of micro-conopeptides belonging to the KIIIA group may provide subtype-selective pharmacological compounds for mammalian neuronal sodium channels and potential therapeutics for the treatment of pain.",

    "title": "Antidepressant Efficacy and Tolerability of Ketamine and Esketamine: A Critical Review.",
    "abstract": "Ketamine and its enantiomer S-ketamine (esketamine) are promising candidates to produce a rapid-onset antidepressant effect in treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine causes continued blockade of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, though this might not primarily mediate the antidepressant effect. Alternative hypotheses include selectivity for the NMDA receptor subtype containing the NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B), inhibition of the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrKB), and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, alongside other independent actions attributed to the ketamine metabolism to R-hydroxynorketamine (R-HNK). The enantiomer S-ketamine (esketamine) displays approximately fourfold greater affinity for the glutamate NMDA receptor in vitro than R-ketamine. Proof-of-concept single-dose and repeat-dose studies with intravenous ketamine show a significant antidepressant and probably antisuicidal effect in the short term, with response rates over 60% as early as 4.5 h after a single dose, with a sustained effect after 24 h, and over 40% after 7 days. This response can be further sustained over several weeks with repeated doses (two to three doses per week). Tolerability seems acceptable in the short term, with transient elevation of blood pressure and mild and transient dissociative and psychotomimetic effects. Intranasal esketamine has shown a comparable antidepressant effect, which has resulted in the US FDA granting the drug a \"breakthrough therapy\" designation, and theoretically it may offer an improved tolerability profile. However, major concerns remain regarding an effective protocol to maintain the clinical antidepressant effect of ketamine seen with acute administration and the safety of ketamine and esketamine in the long term, specifically related to potential neurocognitive and urologic toxicity, together with the potential induction of substance use disorders. Ketamine and esketamine are not currently approved treatments for depression, but the clinical use of ketamine is increasing in a variety of practice settings internationally.",

    "title": "SPACRCAN, a novel human interphotoreceptor matrix hyaluronan-binding proteoglycan synthesized by photoreceptors and pinealocytes.",
    "abstract": "The interphotoreceptor matrix is a unique extracellular complex occupying the interface between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium in the fundus of the eye. Because of the putative supportive role in photoreceptor maintenance, it is likely that constituent molecules play key roles in photoreceptor function and may be targets for inherited retinal disease. In this study we identify and characterize SPACRCAN, a novel chondroitin proteoglycan in this matrix. SPACRCAN was cloned from a human retinal cDNA library and the gene localized to chromosome 3q11.2. Analysis of SPACRCAN mRNA and protein revealed that SPACRCAN is expressed exclusively by photoreceptors and pinealocytes. SPACRCAN synthesized by photoreceptors is localized to the interphotoreceptor matrix where it surrounds both rods and cones. The functional protein contains 1160 amino acids with a large central mucin domain, three consensus sites for glycosaminoglycan attachment, two epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a putative hyaluronan-binding motif, and a potential transmembrane domain near the C-terminal. Lectin and Western blotting indicate an M(r) around 400,000 before and 230,000 after chondroitinase ABC digestion. Removal of N- and O-linked oligosaccharides reduces the M(r) to approximately 160,000, suggesting that approximately 60% of the mass of SPACRCAN is carbohydrate. Finally, we demonstrate that SPACRCAN binds hyaluronan and propose that associations between SPACRCAN and hyaluronan may be involved in organization of the insoluble interphotoreceptor matrix, particularly as SPACRCAN is the major proteoglycan present in this matrix.",

Using 0.312 - 5 nM [(3)H]-DAMGO concentrations and Scatchard plot analysis, B(max) (maximal receptor density) and K(d) (dissociation constant) were determined at different brain regions of interest (amygdala, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus). Acute BPN induced an expected down-regulation and addition of each of the BZDs to BPN induced less down-regulation than did BPN alone, sometimes while altering affinity. Some significant differences in the intensity of these effects were observed between BZDs. FLZ that is widely abused and enlarges BPN toxicity appeared the most potent to increase mu-cell surface receptor density at the lowest dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Besides, LPZ for which the effect on mu-opioid-receptor regulation appeared lower is considered to have a low risk of dependence in the epidemiological data banks. CLZ and ZLP (2 mg/kg) induced the strongest modification on mu-opioid-receptor density, but a substantial decrease in affinity could minimize the functional consequences. The reported changes were maximal in the amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus. Among people using BPN and BZDs, the effects described here are likely to influence addictive behaviors and induce toxic effects that could be quantitatively different due to the quality of the BZD.",

In this study, the DNA gyrase of E. faecalis was purified from a fluoroquinolone-susceptible strain (ATCC 19433) and two resistant isolates, MS16968 and MS16996. Strains MS16968 and MS16996 were 64- to 128-fold and 16- to 32-fold less susceptible, respectively, to fluoroquinolones than was ATCC 19433; MICs of nonquinolone antibacterial agents for these strains were almost equal. The DNA gyrase from ATCC 19433 had two subunits, designated A and B, with properties similar to those of DNA gyrase from other gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus. Inhibition of the supercoiling activity of the enzyme from ATCC 19433 by the fluoroquinolones correlated with their antibacterial activities. In contrast, preparations of DNA gyrase from MS16968 and MS16996 were at least 30-fold less sensitive to inhibition of supercoiling by the fluoroquinolones than the gyrase from ATCC 19433 was. Experiments that combined heterologous gyrase subunits showed that the A subunit from either of the resistant isolates conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones. These findings indicate that an alteration in the gyrase A subunit is the major contributor to fluoroquinolone resistance in E. faecalis clinical isolates. A difference in drug uptake may also contribute to the level of fluoroquinolone resistance in these isolates.",

A rat airpouch model of inflammation has been used to investigate the relationship between eicosanoid generation and TNF production in vivo. Injection of zymosan into the airpouch caused a time-dependent stimulation of TNF production which preceded leukotriene generation by at least 30 minutes. Injection of LPS into the airpouch also stimulated TNF production but not leukotriene generation. The selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, ICI207968, A64077 and BWA4C, and the 5-lipoxygenase translocation inhibitor MK886, decreased leukotriene generation but enhanced TNF production.

In guinea pig brain membranes, (+)-[3H]SKF 10,047 bound to a single class of sites with a Kd of 4 X 10(-8) M and a Bmax of 333 fmol/mg of protein. This binding was different from mu, kappa, or delta opiate receptor binding. It was inhibited by opiates that produce psychotomimetic activities but not by opiates that lack such activities. Some antipsychotic drugs inhibited (+)-[3H]SKF 10,047 binding with high to moderate affinities in the following order of potency: haloperidol greater than perphenazine greater than fluphenazine greater than acetophenazine greater than trifluoperazine greater than molindone greater than or equal to pimozide greater than or equal to thioridazine greater than or equal to chlorpromazine greater than or equal to triflupromazine.

Affinities of antipsychotic drugs for (+)-[3H]SKF 10,047 binding sites did not correlate with those for [3H]spiperone (dopamine D2) sites. [3H]-Haloperidol binding in whole brain membranes was also inhibited by the sigma opiates pentazocine, cyclazocine, and (+)-SKF 10,047.

Compound 10 was synthesized by homologation at the carboxyl end of baclofen using a seven-step reaction sequence. N-Boc-protected (4R, 5R)-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-hydroxy-2-piperidone (18) was deoxygenated via a modified Barton-McCombie reaction to give N-Boc-protected (R)-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-piperidone (20), which was ring opened and deprotected to give 11.HCl. The corresponding S-enantiomer, 12.HCl, was synthesized analogously from the 4S,5S-enantiomer of 18, compound 21. The enantiomeric purities of 11.HCl (ee = 99.8%) and 12. HCl (ee = 99.3%) were determined by chiral HPLC. Compound 10 did not show detectable affinity for GABAA or GABAB receptor sites and was inactive as an agonist or an antagonist at GABAB receptors in the guinea pig ileum. Like the enantiomers of baclofen, neither 11 nor 12 showed detectable affinity for GABAA receptor sites, and in agreement with the findings for (S)-baclofen, 12 did not interact significantly with GABAB receptor sites. Compound 11 (IC50 = 7.4 +/- 0.6 microM), a homologue of (R)-baclofen (2), was shown to be some 50 times weaker than 2 (IC50 = 0.14 +/- 0.01 microM) as an inhibitor of GABAB binding. Accordingly, 11 (EC50 = 150 +/- 23 microM) was shown to be weaker than 2 (EC50 = 11 +/- 1 microM) as an inhibitor of electrically induced contractions of the guinea pig ileum. However, whereas this effect of 2 was sensitive to the GABAB antagonist, CGP35348 (4), the inhibition by 11 was not significantly affected. Furthermore, 12 (EC50 = 310 +/- 16 microM) was shown to be one-half as potent as 11 in this test system, and this effect of 12 also was insensitive to 4. The dissimilarities of the pharmacological effects of 2 and compounds 11 and 12 were emphasized by the observation that whereas 2 only inhibits the ileum contraction by 59 +/- 5%, 11 as well as 12 were shown to inhibit this response by approximately 94%. Neither 11 nor 12 appeared to affect significantly cholinergic mechanisms in the ileum, and their mechanism(s) of action remain enigmatic.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73)-dependent adenosine generation has been implicated in tissue protection during acute injury. Once generated, adenosine can activate cell-surface adenosine receptors (A1 AR, A2A AR, A2B AR, A3 AR). In the present study, we define the contribution of adenosine to cardioprotection by ischemic preconditioning. METHODS AND RESULTS: On the basis of observations of CD73 induction by ischemic preconditioning, we found that inhibition or targeted gene deletion of cd73 abolished infarct size-limiting effects. Moreover, 5'-nucleotidase treatment reconstituted cd73-/- mice and attenuated infarct sizes in wild-type mice. Transcriptional profiling of adenosine receptors suggested a contribution of A2B AR because it was selectively induced by ischemic preconditioning. Specifically, in situ ischemic preconditioning conferred cardioprotection in A1 AR-/-, A2A AR-/-, or A3 AR-/- mice but not in A2B AR-/- mice or in wild-type mice after inhibition of the A2B AR. Moreover, A2B AR agonist treatment significantly reduced infarct sizes after ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, pharmacological and genetic evidence demonstrate the importance of CD73-dependent adenosine generation and signaling through A2B AR for cardioprotection by ischemic preconditioning and suggests 5'-nucleotidase or A2B AR agonists as therapy for myocardial ischemia.",

None of the treated groups differed significantly from the ischemic control group. Tissue myeloperoxidase, ATP and reduced glutathione levels, and plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were increased by ischemia and reperfusion in all groups, but the changes did not differ between the treatment groups.

As XO is the target enzyme of allopurinol, its absence provides a basis for the lack of effect of this agent. However, it is not clear why DFX and SOD &amp; CAT had no protective effect.",

    "abstract": "The allylamine class of antifungal compounds are specific inhibitors of squalene epoxidase (SE). However, depending on their chemical structure, allylamine derivatives can be highly selective for either fungal or mammalian SEs. All allylamines tested previously, irrespective of their selectivity, inhibit fungal SEs in a noncompetitive manner and mammalian SEs in a competitive manner. Here we have analyzed the inhibitory properties of the benzylamine SDZ SBA 586 toward fungal and mammalian SEs in comparison to the systemic antimycotic terbinafine, SDZ SBA 586 was, like terbinafine a selective inhibitor of fungal SE. Microsomal SE from the pathogenic yeast candida albicans was sixfold more sensitive to SDZ SBA 586 than to terbinafine, C50: 8 nM versus 44 nM, while the enzyme from the dermatophyte fungus Trichophyton rubrum was slightly less sensitive to SDZ SBA 586 than to terbinafine, IC50: 39 and 18 nM, respectively. Similarly to terbinafine, SDZ SBA 586 inhibited the yeast enzyme in non competitive manner, SDZ SBA 586 also inhibited mammalian microsomal SEs, but only at micromolar concentrations. It was more active than terbinafine toward both guinea pig SE, IC50: 2 microM versus 4 microM, and rat SE, IC50: 11 microM versus 87 microM. However, in contrast to terbinafine as well as allylamines selective for mammalian SE, SDZ SBA 586 was a noncompetitive inhibitor of rat microsomal SE. Interestingly, depending on the source of microsomal SE, binding of terbinafine and SDZ SBA 586 exhibited a positive, indifferent, or negative cooperativity, suggesting that SE is an oligomeric enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Platelet factor 4 (PF-4) is a CXC-chemokine with strong anti-angiogenic properties. We have shown previously that PF-4 inhibits angiogenesis by associating directly with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), inhibiting its dimerization, and blocking FGF-2 binding to endothelial cells. We now have characterized a small peptide domain (PF-447-70) derived from the C-terminus of PF-4, which conserves anti-angiogenic effects of the parent protein. PF-447-70 inhibited internalization of 125I-FGF-2 by endothelial cells in a time-dependent manner. The peptide reduced FGF-2-stimulated cell migration to control levels in wounded monolayers of bovine capillary endothelial cells. PF-447-70 also reduced FGF-2 induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2, which are essential for migration and survival of endothelial cells. In a serum-free ex vivo angiogenesis assay, the peptide blocked microvessel outgrowth by 89%. A single amino acid substitution within PF-447-70 abolished all inhibitory activities. To simulate a real anti-angiogenic treatment situation, we administered PF-447-70 systemically to mice implanted subcutaneously with FGF-2 containing gelatin sponges with the result of sparse, scattered, and immature vessel growth. The small peptide fragment derived from the angio-inhibitory CXC-chemokine PF-4 might be used as a starting point to develop anti-angiogenic designer drugs for angiogenesis-dependent pathologies such as cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis.",

    "abstract": "The advent of HER2-directed therapies has significantly improved the outlook for patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer. However, a significant proportion of these patients still relapse and die of breast cancer. Trials to define, refine and optimize the use of the two approved HER2-targeted agents (trastuzumab and lapatinib) in patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer are ongoing. In addition, promising new approaches are being developed including monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting HER2 or other HER family members, antibodies linked to cytotoxic moieties or modified to improve their immunological function, immunostimulatory peptides, and targeting the PI3K and IGF-1R pathways. Improved understanding of the HER2 signaling pathway, its relationship with other signaling pathways and mechanisms of resistance has also led to the development of rational combination therapies and to a greater insight into treatment response in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Based on promising results with new agents in HER2-positive advanced-stage disease, a series of large trials in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings are planned or ongoing. This Review focuses on current treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and aims to update practicing clinicians on likely future developments in the treatment for this disease according to ongoing clinical trials and translational research.",

    "title": "The pure antiandrogen RU 23908 (Anandron), a candidate of choice for the combined antihormonal treatment of prostatic cancer: a review.",
    "abstract": "The nonsteroidal antiandrogen RU 23908 ( Anandron ) weakly interacts with the prostatic cytosolic androgen receptor and shows a fast dissociation rate. When administered to immature castrated rats up to the daily dose of 100 mg/kg, it is devoid of any androgenic activity but efficiently blocks the growth-promoting activity of androgens on ventral prostate and seminal vesicle weight, thus showing the characteristics of a pure antiandrogen. In intact animals, on the other hand, the antiandrogen administered alone exerts only a partial inhibition of prostate and seminal vesicle weight. This is due to the property of the pure antiandrogen to neutralize the inhibitory feedback effect of androgens at the pituitary level on the LH responsiveness to LHRH, as illustrated in vitro in rat anterior pituitary cells in culture as well as in vivo in intact and castrated animals. In intact animals, neutralization of the inhibitory feedback action of endogenous androgens leads to an increased LH and testosterone secretion, which partly overcomes the direct action of the antiandrogen at the level of the prostate and seminal vesicles. In fact, the plasma testosterone concentration is more than doubled 6 hr after the administration of 10 mg of RU 23908 while plasma LH and testosterone levels are increased by 7- and 17-fold, respectively, after 14 days of similar daily treatment. Efficient neutralization of the androgenic action at the prostatic level in intact animals thus requires prevention of this escape phenomenon through inhibition of LH secretion. Although inhibition of LH release can be achieved by estrogen and progestins, an optimal inhibitory effect on the prostate is obtained by the combined administration of the antiandrogen with an LHRH agonist that causes a specific blockage of testicular androgen biosynthesis as well as an inhibition of the LH responsiveness to LHRH.",

    "abstract": "The bisphosphonates (BPs) are well established as the treatments of choice for disorders of excessive bone resorption, including Paget's disease of bone, myeloma and bone metastases, and osteoporosis. There is considerable new knowledge about how BPs work. Their classical pharmacological effects appear to result from two key properties: their affinity for bone mineral and their inhibitory effects on osteoclasts. Mineral binding affinities differ among the clinically used BPs and may influence their differential distribution within bone, their biological potency, and their duration of action. The inhibitory effects of the nitrogen-containing BPs (including alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronate) on osteoclasts appear to result from their inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), a key branch-point enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. FPPS generates isoprenoid lipids used for the posttranslational modification of small GTP-binding proteins essential for osteoclast function. Effects on other cellular pathways, such as preventing apoptosis in osteocytes, are emerging as other potentially important mechanisms of action. As a class, BPs share several common properties. However, as with other classes of drugs, there are obvious chemical, biochemical, and pharmacological differences among the various individual BPs. Each BP has a unique profile that may help to explain potential important clinical differences among the BPs, in terms of speed of onset of fracture reduction, antifracture efficacy at different skeletal sites, and the degree and duration of suppression of bone turnover. As we approach the 40th anniversary of the discovery of their biological effects, there remain further opportunities for using their properties for medical purposes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maintenance of remission is a major issue in the management of Crohn's disease. Thalidomide, a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor and its analogue, lenalidomide, may have a role in the management of Crohn's disease, but it is not clear whether it is an effective maintenance therapy. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of thalidomide and lenalidomide for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966 to September 2008), EMBASE (1984 to September 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2008) and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched to identify relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials which compared thalidomide with either placebo or an active comparator were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials met the inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: No studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria were found. In the absence of any suitable randomised controlled trial in this area, no analysis was performed. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support or refute the use of thalidomide or its analogue, lenalidomide, as maintenance therapy for patients with Crohn's disease. Given the teratogenic nature of thalidomide its use for maintenance therapy is difficult to justify. Well designed clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in Crohn's disease and its use is not recommended until these data are available.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer death in industrialized countries and there is an urgent need for the development of preventive treatments that inhibit the progression of initiated cells into overt lung cancer in smokers who quit. Murine pulmonary adenocarcinoma models are widely used to test prospective cancer preventive agents. These tumors are of alveolar type II cell lineage, express growth-regulating signal transduction pathways that are stimulated by epidermal growth factor and protein kinase C while being inhibited by agents that increase intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). By contrast, pulmonary adenocarcinomas induced in hamsters are derived from bronchial and bronchiolar Clara cells, are under beta-adrenergic receptor control and their development is promoted by agents that increase intracellular cAMP. Adenocarcinomas of either cell lineage develop in humans, raising the possibility that agents with strong chemopreventive activity in murine lung cancer models due to stimulation of cAMP may selectively promote human pulmonary adenocarcinomas derived from Clara cells. We therefore compared the effects of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and the activator of cAMP forskolin under controlled in vitro conditions on the human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line NCI-H322 which expresses a Clara cell phenotype versus the human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line A549 which expresses features of alveolar type II cells. Our data show that isoproterenol significantly stimulated cAMP, ERK1/2 activity and DNA synthesis in NCI-H322 cells and that this response involved transactivation of the EGF receptor. By contrast, we found that isoproterenol had no effect on A549 cells whereas forskolin significantly inhibited DNA synthesis and ERK1/2 activity. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that human pulmonary adenocarcinomas of Clara cell lineage are highly sensitive to the cancer promoting effects of beta-adrenergic agonists and other agents that stimulate cAMP whereas human cancers of the same histological family but derived from alveolar type II cells are resistant to beta-adrenergic agonists and respond with a reduction in cell growth to stimulation of cAMP. Our findings suggest that some widely advertised cancer preventive agents such as green tea, retinoids and beta-carotenes are unsafe to be used by smokers or by ex-smokers due to their tumor promoting effects via stimulation of cAMP on initiated cells of Clara cell lineage.",

METHODS: Seven patients (five women and two men) with HS that was not responding well to antibiotics were treated with finasteride at a dose of 5 mg/day as monotherapy. Clinical response was assessed at regular intervals. Patients were followed up for periods varying from 8 months to 2 years. RESULTS: Six patients improved significantly and three of them had complete healing of lesions. Two patients who were followed up for more than 1 year experienced remissions lasting 8-18 months. The drug was generally well tolerated; however, two women complained of breast enlargement.

    "abstract": "1. Long chain fatty acids have recently been identified as agonists for the G protein-coupled receptors GPR40 and GPR120. Here, we present the first description of GW9508, a small-molecule agonist of the fatty acid receptors GPR40 and GPR120. In addition, we also describe the pharmacology of GW1100, a selective GPR40 antagonist. These molecules were used to further investigate the role of GPR40 in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the MIN6 mouse pancreatic beta-cell line. 2. GW9508 and linoleic acid both stimulated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells expressing GPR40 (pEC50 values of 7.32+/-0.03 and 5.65+/-0.06, respectively) or GPR120 (pEC50 values of 5.46+/-0.09 and 5.89+/-0.04, respectively), but not in the parent HEK-293 cell line. 3. GW1100 dose dependently inhibited GPR40-mediated Ca2+ elevations stimulated by GW9508 and linoleic acid (pIC50 values of 5.99+/-0.03 and 5.99+/-0.06, respectively). GW1100 had no effect on the GPR120-mediated stimulation of intracellular Ca2+ release produced by either GW9508 or linoleic acid. 4. GW9508 dose dependently potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in MIN6 cells, but not in primary rat or mouse islets. Furthermore, GW9508 was able to potentiate the KCl-mediated increase in insulin secretion in MIN6 cells. The effects of GW9508 on insulin secretion were reversed by GW1100, while linoleic acid-stimulated insulin secretion was partially attenuated by GW1100. 5. These results add further evidence to a link between GPR40 and the ability of fatty acids to acutely potentiate insulin secretion and demonstrate that small-molecule GPR40 agonists are glucose-sensitive insulin secretagogues.",

    "abstract": "Purified porcine atrial muscarinic receptor (mAcChR) was reconstituted with purified porcine atrial inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein (Gi) in a lipid mixture consisting of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol (1:1:0.1 w/w). 5'-Guanylyl imidodiphosphate (0.1 mM) had no effect on the binding of the muscarinic antagonist L-quinuclidinyl benzilate but converted high-affinity carbachol binding sites (Kd equal to 1 microM) in the reconstituted preparation to the low-affinity state (Kd equal to about 100 microM). Steady-state kinetic measurements of GTPase activity showed that the turnover number was increased from 0.19 min-1 in the presence of the muscarinic antagonist L-hyoscyamine to 2.11 min-1 for the agonist carbachol. The affinity of Gi for GDP was reduced by about 50-fold upon interaction with the carbachol-mAcChR complex, and the observed rate constant for GDP dissociation was increased by 38-fold from 0.12 to 4.5 min-1. Thus, the increase in steady-state GTPase activity observed for muscarinic agonists is largely, if not exclusively, due to the increase in GDP dissociation from Gi--probably the rate-limiting step in the steady-state mechanism. Carbachol-stimulated GTPase was sensitive to ADP-ribosylation of the reconstituted Gi by pertussis toxin, but the high-affinity agonist binding was uncoupled only when the reconstituted preparation was treated with pertussis toxin in the presence of GTP and the agonist acetylcholine. These results suggest that association with the mAcChR protects Gi from ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin.",

We designed, produced, and screened a library of compounds based on an original l-lysine scaffold for their potentials as HIV type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors (PI). One candidate compound, PL-100, emerged as a specific and noncytotoxic PI that exhibited potent inhibition of HIV-1 protease and viral replication in vitro (K(i), approximately 36 pM, and 50% effective concentration [EC(50)], approximately 16 nM, respectively). To confirm that PL-100 possessed a favorable resistance profile, we performed a cross-resistance study using a panel of 63 viral strains from PI-experienced patients selected for the presence of primary PI mutations known to confer resistance to multiple PIs now in clinical use. The results showed that PL-100 retained excellent antiviral activity against almost all of these PI-resistant viruses and that its performance in this regard was superior to those of atazanavir, amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir. In almost every case, the increase in the EC(50) for PL-100 observed with viruses containing multiple mutations in protease was far less than that obtained with the other drugs tested. These data underscore the potential for PL-100 to be used in the treatment of drug-resistant HIV disease and argue for its further development.",

    "abstract": "Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is responsive to a number of different steroid hormones, such as glucocorticoids and retinoids. An active metabolite of vitamin D, 1alpha,25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3), was used to study the effect of this steroid hormone in KS. Steroid hormones exert their effect through their cognate nuclear receptors, which for vitamin D metabolites is the vitamin D receptor (VDR). It was first shown that KS cell lines and primary tumor tissue express high levels of VDR, whereas endothelial cells had minimal expression and fibroblasts had no expression. Second, KS cell growth was inhibited by VDR agonist 1alpha,25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3) with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 5 x 10 -8 mol/L, whereas endothelial cells and fibroblast cells showed no response. Studies on the mechanism of KS tumor growth inhibition by 1alpha,25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3) showed that production of autocrine growth factors interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no effect was observed on vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. Transcription initiated at the IL-6 promoter was repressed by VDR agonist. The DNA sequences required to mediate this repression were localized to nucleotides -225/-110 in the 5'-flanking region. The antitumor activity of VDR agonists was also confirmed in KS tumor xenograft and after topical application in patients with KS. 1alpha,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and its analogs may thus be candidates for clinical development in KS.",

We also tested the impact of combined SGI-110 and NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ T-cells on tumor growth and/or murine survival in a xenograft setting. EOC cells were treated with SGI-110 in vitro at various concentrations and as tumor xenografts with 3 distinct dose schedules. Effects on global methylation (using LINE-1), NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A methylation, mRNA, and protein expression were determined and compared to controls. SGI-110 treated EOC cells were evaluated for expression of immune-modulatory genes using flow cytometry, and were co-cultured with NY-ESO-1 specific T-cell clones to determine immune recognition. In vivo administration of SGI-110 and CD8+ T-cells was performed to determine anti-tumor effects on EOC xenografts. SGI-110 treatment induced hypomethylation and CTA gene expression in a dose dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, at levels generally superior to azacitidine or decitabine. SGI-110 enhanced the expression of MHC I and ICAM-1, and enhanced recognition of EOC cells by NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ T-cells. Sequential SGI-110 and antigen-specific CD8+ cell treatment restricted EOC tumor growth and enhanced survival in a xenograft setting. SGI-110 is an effective hypomethylating agent and immune modulator and, thus, an attractive candidate for combination with CTA-directed vaccines in EOC.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Although the effects of local anesthetics on sodium channels and various other channels and receptors have been intensively investigated, there is little information available about their effects on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. We examined the effects of four local anesthetics (procaine, tetracaine, bupivacaine, and lidocaine) on NMDA-induced currents by using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique in dissociated mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Procaine and tetracaine produced a reversible and concentration-dependent inhibition of NMDA-induced currents, but lidocaine showed little inhibition at 1 mM or less. The half-maximal inhibition values (mM; mean +/- SEM) for procaine, tetracaine, bupivacaine, and lidocaine at -60 mV were 0.296 +/- 0.031, 0.637 +/- 0.044, 2.781 +/- 0.940 (extrapolated data), and 7.766 +/- 14.093 (extrapolated data), respectively. Procaine 0.2 mM reduced the maximal NMDA-induced currents without affecting the 50% effective concentration values for NMDA. The inhibition by procaine exhibited voltage dependence and was more effective at negative potentials. These results indicate a noncompetitive antagonism of procaine on NMDA receptors and suggest that the inhibition is the result of a channel-blocking mechanism. IMPLICATIONS: We examined the effects of four local anesthetics (procaine, tetracaine, bupivacaine, and lidocaine) on NMDA-induced currents by using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique in dissociated mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons.

An atypical non beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor (AR) subtype (beta 3-AR) has been identified which is selectively stimulated by a group of ligands which mediate lipolytic and thermic responses in brown and white adipose tissue. 2. Molecular studies have shown that beta 3-AR in man are mainly expressed in visceral adipocytes, and to a lesser extent in gall-bladder and colon. In vitro studies with beta 3-AR agonists have shown activity at other sites including skeletal muscle and myocardium. 3. Regulation of beta 3-AR may differ from beta 1/beta 2-AR subtypes in that continuous agonist exposure does not result in receptor down-regulation. 4. A polymorphism of the human beta 3-AR gene (Trp64Arg) has been identified which is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and an earlier onset of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Studies are required to establish whether expression of the mutant gene results in altered metabolic responses to beta 3-AR stimulation in man. 5. There is accumulating evidence to support a therapeutic role of beta 3-AR agonists in NIDDM because of anti-obesity and anti-diabetic activity, as a consequence of thermogenic effects as well as increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. 6. Selectivity studies with BRL35135 and isoprenaline in humans have demonstrated a beta 3-AR mediated component to thermogenesis which is dissociated from beta 1/beta 2-mediated effects on carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Similar studies have suggested a functional beta 3-AR mediating cardiac but not airway responses in humans. An evaluation of beta 3-AR agonists in irritable bowel syndrome may be warranted in view of colonic antimotility properties in vitro.",

    "abstract": "We showed previously that grapefruit and orange juices inhibited human enteric organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1A2 in vitro and lowered oral fexofenadine bioavailability clinically. Inhibition of OATP1A2 transport by flavonoids in grapefruit (naringin) and orange (hesperidin) was conducted in vitro. Two randomized, crossover, pharmacokinetic studies were performed clinically. In one study, 120 mg of fexofenadine was ingested with 300 ml grapefruit juice, an aqueous solution of naringin at the same juice concentration (1,200 microM), or water. In the other study, fexofenadine was administered with grapefruit juice, with or 2 h before aqueous suspension of the particulate fraction of juice containing known clinical inhibitors of enteric CYP3A4, but relatively low naringin concentration (34 microM), or with water. Naringin and hesperidin's half-maximal inhibitions were 3.6 and 2.7 microM, respectively. Fexofenadine area under the plasma drug concentration-time curves (AUCs) with grapefruit juice and naringin solution were 55% (P&lt;0.001) and 75% (P&lt;0.05) of that with water, respectively. Fexofenadine AUCs with grapefruit juice and particulate fractions were 57% (P&lt;0.001), 96% (not significant (NS)), and 97% (NS) of that with water, respectively. Individuals tested in both studies (n=9 of 12) had highly reproducible fexofenadine AUC with water (r(2)=0.85, P&lt;0.001) and extent of reduction of it with grapefruit juice (r(2)=0.72, P&lt;0.01). Naringin most probably directly inhibited enteric OATP1A2 to decrease oral fexofenadine bioavailability. Inactivation of enteric CYP3A4 was probably not involved. Naringin appears to have sufficient safety, specificity, and sensitivity to be a clinical OATP1A2 inhibitor probe. Inherent OATP1A2 activity may be influenced by genetic factors. This appears to be the first report of a single dietary constituent clinically modulating drug transport.",

    "abstract": "Caffeine exposure sensitizes tumor cells to ionizing radiation and other genotoxic agents. The radiosensitizing effects of caffeine are associated with the disruption of multiple DNA damage-responsive cell cycle checkpoints. The similarity of these checkpoint defects to those seen in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) suggested that caffeine might inhibit one or more components in an A-T mutated (ATM)-dependent checkpoint pathway in DNA-damaged cells. We now show that caffeine inhibits the catalytic activity of both ATM and the related kinase, ATM and Rad3-related (ATR), at drug concentrations similar to those that induce radiosensitization. Moreover, like ATM-deficient cells, caffeine-treated A549 lung carcinoma cells irradiated in G2 fail to arrest progression into mitosis, and S-phase-irradiated cells exhibit radioresistant DNA synthesis. Similar concentrations of caffeine also inhibit gamma- and UV radiation-induced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15, a modification that may be directly mediated by the ATM and ATR kinases. DNA-dependent protein kinase, another ATM-related protein involved in DNA damage repair, was resistant to the inhibitory effects of caffeine. Likewise, the catalytic activity of the G2 checkpoint kinase, hChk1, was only marginally suppressed by caffeine but was inhibited potently by the structurally distinct radiosensitizer, UCN-01. These data suggest that the radiosensitizing effects of caffeine are related to inhibition of the protein kinase activities of ATM and ATR and that both proteins are relevant targets for the development of novel anticancer agents.",

    "abstract": "A xenoestrogen and known endocrine disruptor, bisphenol A (BPA) binds the human estrogen-related receptor-gamma (ERRgamma) with high affinity (Kd   5.5 nM). It is likely that BPA undergoes oxidative biotransformation by hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid ((-)OCl/HOCl) and peroxynitrite (PN) and the products formed in these reactions may serve as secondary estrogens and contribute to the toxicodynamics of BPA. Therefore, in the present study we have examined the formation of chlorinated and nitrated BPA in reactions of BPA with (-)OCl/HOCl and PN(+CO(2)) performed around the neutral pH. We have identified four major products in these reactions and they include 3-chloro-BPA (CBPA), 3,3'-dichloro-BPA (DCBPA), 3-nitro-BPA (NBPA) and 3,3'-dinitro-BPA (DNBPA). Towards understanding the toxicodynamics and estrogenic activity of BPA in biological systems, we have performed molecular docking of BPA, CBPA, DCBPA, DNBPA and NBPA onto the ERRgamma using AutoDock 4.2 software and compared the binding energies with those of estradiol, the natural ligand. Based on the genetic algorithm, the three best conformations were selected and averaged for each ligand and a detailed analysis of molecular interactions based on free energies of binding (kcal/mol) was computed. The results indicate the following rank order of binding to ERRgamma: BPA (-8.78 +- 0.06) &gt; CBPA (-8.53 +- 0.41) &gt; NBPA (-7.36 +- 0.74) &gt; DCBPA (-5.24 +- 0.17) &gt; DNBPA (-4.95 +- 0.78) &gt; estradiol (-4.94 +- 1.04). The docking studies revealed that the OH group of one of the phenyl rings forms a hydrogen bond with Glu275/Arg316, while the OH group of other phenyl ring was bound to Asp346. These results suggest that both BPA and its putative chlorinated and nitrated metabolites have strong binding affinity compared to estradiol.",

A spectrophotometric study, conducted in order to elucidate the interaction between metal ions and NIT, showed the formation of drug-metal ion complexes. In addition, we examined the relationships between the metal ions-chelating property of NIT and its effects on the decrease of the mannose sensitive hemagglutination titer and the production of siderophores from E. coli. The results suggested that these antimicrobial activities of NIT would also be due to the complexation of metal ions by this molecule.",

    "abstract": "Binding of the mGlu2/3 antagonist HYDIA in the closed conformation model of mGlu2 causes repulsive interactions with Y216 in lobe II of the binding pocket, preventing closure of the VFT.Modulation of metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptors represents a promising target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. The novel mGlu2/3 ligand HYDIA ((1S,2R,3R,5R,6S)-2-amino-3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) is a conformationally restricted and hydroxylated glutamate analogue. HYDIA is a potent and selective competitive antagonist of L-glutamate at the mGlu2/3 receptors in spite of being structurally very similar to the bicyclic LY354740, which is a potent and selective mGlu2/3 agonist. By comparing these two ligands, this study delineate the interaction mode of (3)H-HYDIA at the mGlu2 receptor, using both mutagenesis studies and computational modeling. Binding of HYDIA in the closed conformation model of mGlu2 results in repulsive interaction with the Y216 residue, preventing closure of the binding pocket and thus receptor activation. Consequently, HYDIA is proposed to bind in an open conformation model of mGlu2. Mutation of the structurally important Y216 residue in the binding site caused complete loss of affinity of both (3)H-LY354740 and (3)H-HYDIA. T168 in lobe I was shown to have an important role in HYDIA binding, and in the open conformation model this residue is interacting with the amino group of HYDIA. The Y144 residue in lobe I is shown to be engaged in both receptor interlobe binding and ligand interaction. Receptor mutations at this position (Y144G, Y144S and Y144A) showed dramatic impact on binding affinity and functional effect of HYDIA. The mGlu2 receptor mutants with increased structural flexibility at this position, which is crucial for pocket closure, were clearly preferred. These studies highlight the unique properties of the novel (3)H-HYDIA ligand and provide further support to our understanding of binding and signal transduction mechanisms of the mGlu2 receptor.",

    "abstract": "Nicotine caused a contraction of the rat coronary artery in the presence of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and arachidonic acid, and did not in the absence of these agents. The present experiments were undertaken to pharmacologically characterize the nicotine-induced contraction in ring preparations of the rat coronary artery. The contraction was abolished by chemical removal of endothelium saponin. Oxygen radical scavengers, superoxide dismutase and catalase, significantly attenuated the contraction. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitors (flurbiprofen, ketoprofen and ketrolack) attenuated the nicotine-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors at high concentrations (nimesulide and NS-389) slightly attenuated the contraction. A TXA2 synthetase inhibitor (OKY-046) attenuated the contraction to a small extent only at high concentrations. A TXA2 receptor antagonist (S-1452) attenuated the contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. A nicotinic receptor antagonist (hexamethonium) attenuated the contraction in part and an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist (prazosin) nearly abolished the contraction. From these results, it was suggested that the contraction induced by nicotine in the rat coronary artery in the presence of L-NAME and arachidonic acid is endothelium dependent, and involves reactive oxygen species and endothelial COX-1 metabolites of arachidonic acid. Part of the contraction is probably due to release of norepinephrine.",

All plasma analyzed with this method was acidified with 1M HCl and 46% citric acid solution in a ratio of 100:10:1 (v:v:v) to avoid the pH-based degradation of TP300 and to shift the equilibria of 3076 and 3011 between the lactone and carboxylate forms towards the lactone forms. After the plasma proteins were precipitated with methanol:acetonitrile:HCl 1M (50:50:1, v:v:v) containing stable isotopic internal standards, the analytes were trapped on an Xterra MS C18 column (10x2.1 mm i.d., 5 mum) and separated on a Gemini C18 column (50x2.0 mm i.d., 5 mum) using column-switching liquid chromatography.

Thus considerable efforts are devoted to the development of aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) as possible pharmacotherapeutic agents. The establishment of adequate QSAR models would serve to this purpose. In the present study multivariate statistics was applied in order to analyse the AR inhibitory activity data of twenty three pyrrol-1-yl-acetic acid derivatives on the basis of essential molecular descriptors. The compounds contain one or two carbonyl keto groups, which serve as a bridge to link the pyrrole moiety to aromatic nuclei with or without further substitution. An adequate one component model with satisfactory statistics was obtained and validated for its robustness and predictive ability. The influence of the different descriptors in ARI activity is discussed. The derived model was further used to predict the activity of four independent compounds and the contribution of their specific structural characteristics in ARI activity was evaluated.",

    "abstract": "We describe the nucleic acid sequence encoding a human 5-hydroxytryptamine1D (5-HT1D) serotonin receptor and some of the functional characteristics of the gene product. The receptor gene was isolated by hybridization to a probe based on a canine thyroid cDNA (called RDC4) previously isolated by others and believed to encode a heretofore undetermined member of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-linked receptor family. The human clone we isolated, called MA6A, contains an apparently intronless open reading frame encoding a 377-amino acid polypeptide with the seven hydrophobic domains characteristic of G protein-linked receptors. The MA6A deduced amino acid sequence is 88% identical to that for RDC4 and 43% identical to that for the human 5-HT1A receptor. Expression of the human gene product in transfected cell lines results in the appearance of saturable high affinity 5-HT1D-type [3H]5-HT binding. The expressed receptor exhibits features indicative of coupling to Gi proteins, i.e., robust inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and formation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive high agonist affinity binding state. These findings may help clarify several ambiguities in the classification and action of serotonin receptor subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Spin-labeled analogs of biotin (vitamin H), hexamethonium, decamethonium, dichlorisoproterenol, propranolol, and primaquine containing the nitroxide free radical have been synthesized and tested for biological activity. The four spin-labeled analogs of biotin, 4-biotinamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (IV), 3-biotinamido-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (V), 3-biotinamidomethyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (VI), and 4-(biotinylglycyl)amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (VII), all interacted with avidin, a specific biotin binding protein found in raw egg white, at the same sites as did biotin itself. An unsymmetrical decamethonium spin label (XVIII) in which one of the quaternary methyl groups had been replaced by the 4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) moiety was 13 times more potent as an inhibitor of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase than the parent drug. The symmetrical decamethonium (XVI) and hexamethonium (XIV) spin labels were 18 and 1.8 times as active as decamethonium in the same assay system. The substitution of the 4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) group for the isopropyl groups of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs dichlorisoproterenol and propranolol, to give spin labels XXI and XXII, caused a 45 and 54% reduction, respectively, in the ability of these compounds to inhibit the isoproterenol-stimulated activity of rat fat cell membranes. Finally, modification of primaquine by the introduction of the 4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) substituent into the amino group of the butyl side chain completely abolished the ability of the drug to bind to nuclei acids. These results suggest that the incorporation of the nitroxide group into drug molecules may be a useful approach to the synthesis of more specific spin labels for biological systems, such as egg white avidin, acetylcholinesterase, and the beta-adrenergic receptor.",

    "abstract": "Remifentanil is a new selective mu opioid receptor agonist of higher potency than alfentanil, with pharmacological effects that essentially parallel those of alfentanil and other opioids in this class. Unlike other opioids, remifentanil is rapidly hydrolysed by nonspecific plasma and tissue esterases: this imparts brevity of action, precise and rapidly titratable effects (due to rapid onset and offset), non-cumulative opioid effects and rapid recovery after cessation of administration. The onset of action of remifentanil is similar to that of alfentanil, although its offset is considerably more rapid and independent of the duration of infusion. Remifentanil also has a sparing effect on hypnotics and sedatives. Its brevity of action ensures not only a rapid resolution of adverse effects but also a rapid offset of analgesic effect. Therefore, appropriate postoperative analgesia, when necessary, should be established before discontinuation of remifentanil infusion. The unique pharmacokinetic profile of remifentanil facilitates 'real time' management of intraoperative stress, as well as provision of optimal intraoperative analgesia without compromising recovery for a variety of surgical procedures.",

    "title": "Eszopiclone: its use in the treatment of insomnia.",
    "abstract": "Eszopiclone is the S-isomer of racemic zopiclone, a cyclopyrrolone with sedative-hypnotic activity that has been available in Europe, Canada, and Latin America since 1987. Eszopiclone acts by binding to the GABA(A) receptor. In contrast to the benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotics, eszopiclone has more selectivity for certain subunits of the GABA(A) receptor. Oral eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed to body tissues including the brain. Peak plasma concentrations are attained 1.0-1.6 hours after a 3 mg dose, while the mean elimination half-life is 6 hours. The half-life increases with age to about 9.0 hours in patients 65 years or older. Eszopiclone's pharmacokinetic (PK) profile is not substantially modified in patients suffering from renal failure or mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, although patients with severe hepatic insufficiency should have a reduced dose. The subjective perception of improved sleep following eszopiclone 2 or 3 mg treatment has been demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of up to 6 months' duration. In these studies the drug significantly reduced sleep onset latency (SOL), the number of awakenings, and wake time after sleep onset (WASO) whereas total sleep time (TST) and quality of sleep were increased in non-elderly and elderly subjects. Sleep laboratory studies of the effects of eszopiclone have confirmed the drug's clinical efficacy in subjects with chronic primary insomnia. Eszopiclone, unlike BZD hypnotics, does not significantly alter values corresponding to slow wave sleep (SWS or stages 3 and 4) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Rebound insomnia following withdrawal of eszopiclone has been examined in only one study. Discontinuation of the active treatment with 2 mg was followed by rebound insomnia in non-elderly subjects. Three-mg doses of eszopiclone administered for a period of up to 12 months was associated with a sustained beneficial effect on sleep induction and maintenance, with no occurrence of tolerance. The most common side-effects were unpleasant or bitter taste, headache, dyspepsia, pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, upper respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, dizziness, and accidental injury. New adverse events (withdrawal symptoms) including anxiety, abnormal dreams, hyperesthesia, nausea, and upset stomach were recorded in one study on the days following eszopiclone 2 or 3 mg discontinuation. Although dependence and abuse potential have not been formally assessed, unpublished data show that eszopiclone at doses of 6 and 12 mg produces euphoria effects similar to those of diazepam 20 mg in BZD drug addicts. In conclusion, available evidence tends to indicate that eszopiclone is effective and safe for the treatment of chronic primary insomnia in non-elderly and elderly subjects. Tolerance did not occur during active drug administration for a 12-month period. Thus eszopiclone can be efficacious not only during short- and intermediate-term administration but also in patients requiring prolonged regular drug usage.",

Three methods, namely, conventional CoMFA, all orientation search (AOS) CoMFA, and CoMSIA were applied to the training sets. While the AOS CoMFA models gave the best internal predictions (cross-validated r(2) values from the training sets), which are satisfactory, CoMSIA models gave the best external predictions (predictive r(2) values from the test sets).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin (DCLHb) has demonstrated a pressor effect that could adversely affect traumatic hemorrhagic shock patients through diminished perfusion to vital organs, causing base deficit (BD) and lactate abnormalities. METHODS: Data from two parallel, multicenter traumatic hemorrhagic shock clinical trials from 17 US Emergency Departments and 27 European Union prehospital services using DCLHb, a hemoglobin-based resuscitation fluid. RESULTS: In the 219 patients, the mean age was 37.3 years, 64% of the patients sustained a blunt injury, 48% received DCLHb resuscitation, and the overall 28-day mortality rate was 36.5%. BD data did not differ by treatment group (DCLHb vs. normal saline [NS]) at any time point. Study entry BD was higher in patients who died when compared with survivors in both studies (US: -14.7 vs. -9.3 and European Union: -11.1 vs. -4.1 mEq/L, p &lt; 0.003) and at the first three time points after resuscitation. No differences in BD based on treatment group were observed in either those who survived or those who died from the hemorrhagic shock. US lactate data did not differ by treatment group (DCLHb vs. NS) at any time point. Study entry lactates were higher in US patients who ultimately died when compared with survivors (82.4 vs. 56.1 mmol/L, p &lt; 0.003) and at all five postresuscitation time points. No lactate differences were observed between DCLHb and NS survivors or in those who died based on treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Although patients who died had more greatly altered perfusion than those who survived, DCLHb treatment of traumatic hemorrhagic shock patients was not associated with BD or lactate abnormalities that would indicate poor perfusion.",

We investigated the in vitro acute effects of compounds used for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular diseases on total ALP activity from male Wistar rat heart homogenate. ALP activity was determined by quantifying, at 410 nm, the p-nitrophenol released from p-nitrophenylphosphate (substrate in Tris buffer, pH 10.4). Using specific inhibitors of ALP activity and the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we showed that the rat heart had high ALP activity (31.73 +/- 3.43 nmol p-nitrophenol.mg protein-1.min-1): mainly tissue-nonspecific ALP but also tissue-specific intestinal ALP type II. Both ALP isoenzymes presented myocardial localization (striated pattern) by immunofluorescence. ALP was inhibited a) strongly by 0.5 mM levamisole, 2 mM theophylline and 2 mM aspirin (91, 77 and 84%, respectively) and b) less strongly by 2 mM L-phenylalanine, 100 mL polyphenol-rich beverages and 0.5 mM progesterone (24, 21 to 29 and 11%, respectively). beta-estradiol and caffeine (0.5 and 2 mM) had no effect; 0.5 mM simvastatin and 2 mM atenolol activated ALP (32 and 36%, respectively). Propranolol (2 mM) tended to activate ALP activity and corticosterone activated (18%) and inhibited (13%) (0.5 and 2 mM, respectively). We report, for the first time, that the rat heart expresses intestinal ALP type II and has high total ALP activity. ALP activity was inhibited by compounds used in the prevention of cardiovascular pathology. ALP manipulation in vivo may constitute an additional target for intervention in cardiovascular diseases.",

    "title": "Piglet saphenous vein contains multiple relaxatory prostanoid receptors: evidence for EP4, EP2, DP and IP receptor subtypes.",
    "abstract": "Prostaglandin E(2) produced endothelium-independent relaxation of phenylephrine- and 5-HT-contracted piglet saphenous vein (PSV; pEC(50)=8.6+/-0.2; n=6). The prostanoid EP(4) receptor antagonist GW627368X (30-300 nM) produced parallel rightward displacement of PGE(2) concentration-effect (E/[A]) curves (pK(b)=9.2+/-0.2; slope=1). Higher concentrations of GW627368X did not produce further rightward shifts, revealing the presence of non-EP(4) prostanoid receptors. In all, 18 other prostanoid receptor agonists relaxed PSV in a concentration-related manner. Relative potencies of agonists most sensitive to 10 muM GW627368X (and therefore predominantly activating EP(4) receptors) correlated well with those at human recombinant EP(4) receptors in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells (r(2)=0.74). In the presence of 10 microM GW627368X, the rank order of agonist relative potency matched that of the human recombinant EP(2) receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells (r(2)=0.72). Iloprost, cicaprost and PGI(2) relaxed PSV maximally and were antagonised by 10 microM GW627368X, demonstrating that they were full EP(4) receptor agonists. Residual responses to these compounds in the presence of GW627368X suggested the presence of IP receptors.BW245C relaxed PSV maximally (pEC(50)=6.8+/-0.1). In the presence of 10 microM GW627368X, BW245C produced biphasic E/[A] curves (phase one pEC(50)=6.6; alpha=24%; phase two pEC(50)=5.1; alpha=112%). Phase two was antagonised by the DP receptor antagonist BW A868C (1 microM), demonstrating that BW245C is an agonist at DP and EP4 receptors. We conclude that PSV contains EP(4), EP(2), DP and IP receptors; IP receptor agonists are also porcine EP(4) receptor agonists.",

    "title": "A prospective assessment of the inter-laboratory variability of biochemical markers of fibrosis (FibroTest) and activity (ActiTest) in patients with chronic liver disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biochemical markers for liver fibrosis (FibroTest) and necroinflammatory features (ActiTest) are an alternative to liver biopsy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Our aim was to assess the inter-laboratory variability of these tests, and their 6 components (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alanine aminotransferase, alpha2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, and total bilirubin) and to identify factors associated with this variability. RESULTS: Serum of 24 patients with chronic hepatitis C or severe alcoholic liver disease were prospectively recorded and analyzed in one reference center and in 8 additional laboratories. When gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotransferase were expressed in international units, there was no significant difference between laboratories in the results of FibroTest or ActiTest; kappa statistics were greater than 0.50 with only 0.8% of cases (3/384) with a discordance of more than one stage. The main factor significantly associated with variability was the expression of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotransferase, as multiples of upper limit of reference values. The use of standardized method with pyridoxal phosphate reduced the variability of alanine aminotransferase expression, and standardized original Szasz method reduced the variability of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase expression. CONCLUSIONS: The variability of FibroTest and ActiTest was acceptable without clinical consequences for the prediction of the stage of liver fibrosis and grade of activity. Standardized methods and assay calibration should be used and expression of alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in multiples of the upper limit of reference values should not be employed.",
